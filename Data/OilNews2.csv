India’s government is mulling over a plan to spin off the natural gas pipeline business of its biggest gas utility GAIL (India) Ltd in a bid to increase transparency, Bloomberg reported on Monday, citing people with knowledge of the issue.The Indian oil ministry is seeking government approval to separate the natural gas transmission business from the gas marketing activities of GAIL under a separate fully owned entity under GAIL, Bloomberg’s sources said.  The possible split of the two businesses is aimed at achieving greater transparency and potentially giving the government the opportunity to sell shares in the new entity at some later stage, according to Bloomberg.



This is not the first time that the Indian government has considered separating the transmission from the gas marketing business of GAIL.In April last year, the chairman of India’s sector regulator, the Petroleum and Natural Gas Board, D.K. Sarraf, told Reuters that India wanted to split its biggest gas marketing and trading firm, state-run GAIL (India) Ltd, into two separate companies by the end of March 2019, in a bid to open up its gas sector to industrial end-users and attract billions of U.S. dollars in investment in liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals.These plans didn’t materialize, so now India is reportedly pursuing a spin-off of the gas transmission business.Related: IEA: Huge Oil Glut Coming In 2020



Answering a question in Parliament about the splitting of GAIL’s businesses, India’s Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said earlier this year that the “government in-principle believes that gas transmission and marketing should be two separate functions in order to promote more transparency and competition in both gas marketing and transmission activities.”  According to the BP Energy Outlook – 2019, India’s share of total global primary energy demand is expected to roughly double to around 11 percent by 2040, driven by strong population growth and economic development. India’s natural gas demand—after having surged by 200 percent between 1995 and 2017—is expected to soar by another 242 percent until 2040, at an annual growth rate of 5.5 percent.India’s domestic gas production will rise only modestly amid this surging demand, meaning that India’s reliance on natural gas imports is set to continue to grow significantly, BP reckons.

China’s greenhouse gas emissions jumped by 53.5 percent in the decade between 2005 and 2014, according to Chinese government figures that Beijing is obliged to report as a signatory to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.hinese emissions hit 12.3 billion tons in 2014, which was a more than 50-percent surge compared to emissions in 2005, the figures, cited by Reuters, showed.Carbon emissions data from China, the world’s largest greenhouse gas emission producer, is opaque, but the country has to regularly report data to the United Nations. China has previously reported carbon emission data for 2005 and 2010, Reuters says.



A study published in Nature Geoscience in July last year argued that China’s carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions peaked in 2013 at 9.53 gigatons and have declined in each of the following three years to 2016. According to the authors of the study, the slowing pace of Chinese economic growth has made it easier to cut emissions. The biggest drivers of the decrease in CO2 emissions between 2014 and 2016 were changes in China’s industrial structure and diminishing share of coal in energy consumption. The authors concluded that “the decline of Chinese emissions is structural and is likely to be sustained if the nascent industrial and energy system transitions continue.”China has pledged that its total CO2 emissions would peak around 2030 and its carbon intensity would fall sharply by then. Last week, Chinese media reported that China is vowing to continue its efforts to fight climate change and boost energy saving and speed up emissions reduction.As for the United States' carbon emissions, earlier this year, Dr. Fatih Birol, the Executive Director of the International Energy Agency (IEA), said the U.S. CO2 emissions reduction over the past decade has been the largest cut in emissions in the history of energy.



The IEA, however, has a stark warning to the world: last year global carbon emissions reached 33.1 gigatons, breaking their previous record even though the annual increase was relatively modest, at 1.7 percent.

A natural gas pipeline in central Syria, which is under government control, went out of service on Sunday after militants attacked it, Syria’s state news agency SANA reported.The gas pipeline was attacked by terrorists in the Homs province of Syria, where remnants of Islamic State militants are still active, despite the terrorist group losing nearly all the territory it once held in Syria.The pipeline attack by terrorists cut the natural gas flow from the al-Shaer gas field, the country’s largest, to the Ebla gas processing plant, SANA reports, without specifying who the terrorists were.



The gas pipeline carries some 2.5 million cubic meters of natural gas to the Ebla processing plant, and from the plant to power stations in the area.Technical teams are busy fixing the gas pipeline in order to resume pumping gas in the coming hours, the Syrian state news agency added.After ISIS was pushed out of most of Syrian territory, remnants of the terrorist organization spread to the semi-desert Badia area and try to attack residential areas and vital infrastructure. Syrian government forces often clash with the remnants of Islamic State in the area.



It is not clear yet who the attackers of the gas pipeline were—ISIS or parties from “within the Syrian regime which are benefiting from getting this line out of service,” the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based war monitor, said on Sunday.Whoever the attackers were, the gas pipeline going out of service is the latest blow to Syria’s embattled energy sector, following sabotages on oil pipelines in the country at the end of June.Five underwater pipelines carrying crude oil were sabotaged in the third weekend of June, the Syrian Petroleum and Mineral Resources Ministry said on June 23. The damage done, however, must not have been extensive, because the ministry also said repairs had started immediately and the pipelines would return to normal operation in hours.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:This Arms Deal Could Trigger A New ‘’Cold War’’IEA: Huge Oil Glut Coming In 202024/7 Power: The Future Of Solar

The UK will facilitate the release of the Iranian oil tanker detained by Gibraltar earlier this month if Iran gave guarantees that the crude loaded on that vessel wasn’t bound for Syria, the UK’s Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said over the weekend.In early July, Gibraltar, assisted by Royal Marines, detained a super tanker carrying crude oil to Syria because it had “reasonable grounds” to believe that the Iranian ship Grace 1 was violating European Union sanctions against Syria.Shipping data that Reuters has reviewed suggests that the tanker en route to Syria was loaded with Iranian oil off the Iranian coast. If the tanker indeed loaded oil from Iran, it was not only in breach of EU sanctions on the Syrian entity owning the refinery believed to be the destination of the oil, but it also violated the U.S. sanctions on Iran’s oil exports.



Tensions between the UK and Iran quickly escalated after the seizure of the Iranian tanker, with Tehran threatening to seize a UK-flagged vessel, and last week trying to block a British-flagged oil tanker near the Strait of Hormuz.After speaking to Iran’s Foreign Minister Javad Zarif, the UK’s Foreign Secretary Hunt tweeted on Saturday:“Just spoke to Iranian Foreign Minister Zarif. Constructive call. I reassured him our concern was destination not origin of the oil on Grace One &that UK would facilitate release if we received guarantees that it would not be going to Syria, following due process in Gib courts.”Zarif assured Hunt that Iran wants to resolve the issue and “is not seeking to escalate,” the UK foreign secretary added.



Early on Monday, Hunt said that he was heading to Brussels “for urgent talks on how to reduce tensions with Iran. Their approach to Mid East has been profoundly destabilising but we want to reduce not raise tensions over Grace 1 and avoid a nuclearised region.”Meanwhile, the Chief Minister of Gibraltar, Fabian Picardo, discussed the issue of the detained tanker with Hunt before Hunt spoke to the Iranian foreign minister, and said in a statement:“I also asked that the Foreign Secretary should communicate to the Iranian authorities that Gibraltar remained determined to enforce the EU sanctions against Syria through our Court processes but that we would be prepared to facilitate the release of the detained assets to a rightful claimant if we were satisfied that we had received guarantees that it would not be going to Syria or to any entity sanctioned under the relevant EU regulations.”   By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Middle East Tanker Insurance Rates Soar 10-FoldWhy This Oil Rally Won’t LastOil & Gas Discoveries Rise In High-Risk Oil Frontiers

The utility servicing New York City will be investigating the root cause of the massive power outage on the West Side of Manhattan on Saturday evening, while cyber and physical attacks have already been ruled out as causes for the blackout.Late on Saturday afternoon, Con Edison, the company servicing New York, said that it was responding to “extensive outages on the Westside of Manhattan.”  The power outage plunged Midtown Manhattan into darkness, cut short dozens of evening Broadway shows, and forced officials to evacuate 25,000 fans of a sold-out Jennifer Lopez concert at the Madison Square Garden after the blackout cut electricity three songs into the set list.  There have been no reports of anyone hurt or injured during the blackout, although the Fire Department had to respond to calls for more than 400 stuck elevators across Manhattan.



Early on Sunday, Con Edison said that crews had completed the restoration of the power to 72,000 customers on the West Side of Manhattan who were left without electricity for five hours after 7 p.m. on Saturday.“With all customers back in service, the company will focus on investigating the cause of the equipment failures and on getting the electrical-delivery system back to its normal level of reliability,” Con Edison said.“This was not a cyber attack and this was not an act of physical terrorism,” New York mayor Bill de Blasio said.The outage was not caused by heavy demand either, as it occurred during a period of low power usage, de Blasio noted.



“While this situation was luckily contained, the fact that it happened at all is unacceptable,” New York State Governor Andrew Cuomo said, adding that he had directed the Public Service Commission to do “a full and thorough investigation into the cause of tonight's blackout and we will hold all parties accountable in ensuring this does not happen again.” Con Edison has been fined by PSC in the past—for example in 2007 with US$18 million for power failures, including a nine-day blackout in part of Queens in 2006.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:IEA: Huge Oil Glut Coming In 2020An Unexpected Boon For Alberta’s Oil ProducersSigns Of Slower Permian Oil Growth Continue To Emerge

The Pentagon is scrambling to find a way to develop the United States’ rare earths mining capability as the trade war with China threatens to disrupt the flow of the critical minerals to the United States, according to a Reuters exclusive.At present, about 85% the world’s rare earths mining and refining capacity is in China, and because of this, the United States finds itself in a risky position. This position was made even risker when just weeks ago, China threatened to restrict rare earths exports to the United States. If that happened, production of items that require the minerals would be disrupted, which include iPhones and other consumer electronics,  lasers, electric vehicles, and much more.The United States imports 80% of the rare earths it used between 2014 and 2017, with the United States being the home only to one rare earths mining operation: Mountain Pass. But while Mountain Pass can mine the minerals, it doesn’t have the power to process them. So, it ships the minerals to China to be refined. Ring the alarm bells.



On top of that, the owner of Mountain Pass, MP Materials, is backed in part by a Chinese company, who holds a minority, non-voting stake in MP Materials. Ring ring.To stave off what could be a disastrous situation, Washington is finally ready to act, asking miners to come up with plans to develop rare earths on US soil, including both the mining and the processing facilities, according to Reuters. The Pentagon is asking for a quick response from interested miners—just a few weeks, in fact, by July 31.Along with the request for interested miners, the Pentagon also asked manufacturers to detail their future demand for rare earths to better assess the country’s need for the minerals going forward.



Even if the Pentagon is successful in developing rare earth minerals in the United States, it will be years before the United States can shake its China minerals habit.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:The Bullish Case For OilMiddle East Tanker Insurance Rates Soar 10-FoldWhy This Oil Rally Won’t Last

Growing natural gas production from the Vaca Muerta shale play has recently helped Argentina to export its first liquefied natural gas (LNG) cargo and to resume pipeline natural gas exports to its neighbors Brazil and Chile, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said in a report on Friday.  Argentina was a net exporter of natural gas between 1990 and 2007, but with declines in natural gas production from mature fields, the country became a net importer of natural gas in 2008.The shale gas production from the Vaca Muerta formation has been steadily rising in recent years and has been the main contributor to the to the country’s natural gas production.



Thanks to Vaca Muerta’s output, which accounts for some 23 percent of Argentina’s total gross natural gas production, Argentina shipped in June its first LNG cargo from the offshore Tango floating liquefaction unit (FLNG).According to the EIA, Tango FLNG has a production capacity of 500,000 metric tons (0.07 Bcf/d) of LNG and is expected to produce up to eight LNG-export cargoes annually. However, Argentina’s LNG export growth will need investments in pipelines and onshore liquefaction facilities or the use of more FLNG units, the EIA noted. After becoming a net natural gas importer in 2008, Argentina imported both pipeline and LNG throughout the year. But as natural gas production has been growing, in the past two years Argentina imported LNG only in the cooler months, March through October.



“Argentina will likely continue importing LNG during cooler months until additional pipeline infrastructure is built to deliver growing shale production to major demand centers,” the EIA said.Argentina could become a major LNG supplier to Asian markets because Argentina’s peak LNG potential in the southern hemisphere’s summer coincides with strong demand in Asia in the northern hemisphere’s winter, Wood Mackenzie said last month.Vaca Muerta has been one of the few bright spots in shale gas production outside the United States, but it hasn’t come even close to replicating the U.S. shale revolution. Now developers are turning their attention to exporting natural gas and to tapping more oil in the Vaca Muerta formation.  By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Oil Jumps On Hefty Crude DrawA Red Flag For Oil?

Amid escalating UK-Iran tensions in the Middle East, the UK is deploying a second warship to the Persian Gulf to operate for a brief time alongside the ship that fended off an Iranian attempt to block an oil tanker earlier this week.The UK will send the HMS Duncan, which is currently in the Mediterranean, to the Persian Gulf, and she is expected to join next week the HMS Montrose, the ship that ensured safe passage of a UK tanker through the Strait of Hormuz when it was approached by Iranian military boats earlier this week.The UK has issued a ‘heightened security’ alert for all Britain-flagged commercial vessels passing through the Strait of Hormuz in recent days, Sky News reported on Thursday, quoting two maritime industry sources.The UK Department for Transport has issued updated guidance in recent days as Iran threatened retaliation after Gibraltar detained last week an Iranian oil tanker en route to Syria.   



According to one of Sky News’ sources, UK-flagged ships were advised to keep high alert for Iranian patrol boats “being aggressive towards them.”Iranian military boats did try to seize a British oil tanker near the Strait of Hormuz after threats of “consequences” for the UK following the seizure of the Iranian tanker by Gibraltar.After the escalation of tensions this week, the UK is sending the second warship that will briefly operate alongside HMS Montrose before HMS Montrose comes off for scheduled maintenance.  “As part of our long-standing presence in the Gulf, HMS Duncan is deploying to the region to ensure we maintain a continuous maritime security presence while HMS Montrose comes off task for pre-planned maintenance and crew changeover,” a UK government spokeswoman said on Friday, as carried by the BBC.



“This will ensure that the UK, alongside international partners, can continue to support freedom of navigation for vessels transiting through this vital shipping lane,” the government said.The Strait of Hormuz is the most important oil chokepoint in the world with daily oil flows averaging 21 million bpd, or the equivalent of 21 percent of global petroleum liquids consumption.

Weighed down by depressed refining margins earlier this year, refiners across Asia have recently reduced production and some closed down for maintenance, thus boosting Asian refining margins in the past three weeks to their highest since September 2017, Reuters reported on Friday, citing data from Refinitiv.In the last three weeks, the benchmark Singapore refining margin more than tripled to US$9.37 a barrel at Thursday’s close of Asian markets, from just US$2.74 per barrel on June 21. Profits for gasoline, diesel, naphtha, jet fuel, and high-sulfur fuel oil (HFSO) have all increased in the past weeks, after falling to multi-year lows earlier in the year, Reuters reported.Some refiners across Asia have shut down for maintenance, and others have reduced fuels production after Asia’s refining margins slipped to a 16-year low in May.



Some Chinese refiners are also curtailing refinery runs in the third quarter as massive refinery start-ups and slowing domestic fuel demand have created a fuel glut in the country, hurting refining margins. A fuel glut coming from China weighed heavily on Asian margins earlier this year. An increase in refining capacity, particularly from the independent refiners, and another increase in oil product export quotas have seen a substantial increase in the availability of Chinese oil products in the region, and this increase has added its own pressure to refining margins.Although refiners in Asia were not left without choice for crude after the end of the U.S. sanction waivers for Iranian oil, the higher price of alternative supplies, as well as soaring fuel exports from China, were depressing refining margins across Asia in May and for most of June.

Thanks to demand from the start-up of major refineries, Chinese crude oil imports in June have increased since May, and has increased by 15.2 percent from June last year, customs data compiled by Reuters showed on Friday.China’s crude oil imports in June averaged 9.63 million bpd, an increase of 1.7 percent from an average of 9.47 million bpd in imports in May, and a 15.2-percent increase from 8.36 million bpd in June last year, according to Reuters calculations in barrels from data in tons provided by the Chinese General Administration of Customs.Despite weaker refining margins and a glut of refined oil products, demand for crude in China increased last month thanks to Hengli Petrochemical, which had a new refinery start up earlier this year and ramped up to full 400,000-bpd capacity at the end of May. Another 400,000-bpd refinery, of Zhejiang Petrochemical, began trial runs, further pushing demand for crude.



China’s June crude oil imports increased from May, but were off their record in April, when China hit a new monthly record of 10.64 million bpd in crude imports as refiners rushed to stock up on Iranian oil before the U.S. removed the sanction waivers.Then, China’s crude oil imports dropped in May from the monthly record in April, as Chinese refiners drastically reduced Iranian oil imports after the end of the U.S. waivers and as some state refineries were offline for planned maintenance.According to Chinese customs data and Reuters estimates, crude oil imports in the first half of 2019 averaged around 9.87 million bpd, which is an 8.8-percent increase in import volumes compared to the first half of 2018.  



However, China’s crude oil demand, and possibly imports, could be dragged down in the short term by signs of wobbling economy and refiners curtailing refinery runs in the third quarter as massive refinery start-ups and slowing domestic fuel demand have created a fuel glut in the country, hurting refining margins.

The shareholders of Anadarko Petroleum will vote on the company’s takeover by Occidental on August 8, Reuters reports, adding that Occidental avoided a shareholder vote on the deal by securing US$10 billion in funding for the deal from Warren Buffett.Occidental beat Chevron to Anadarko after it offered US$38 billion for the company, 80 percent of it in cash, in addition to the assumption of Anadarko’s debt. Initially, Oxy offered 50 percent of the US$57-billion debt-including price in cash and the rest in stock, but Anadarko was reluctant to accept this bid. Oxy then upped the cash portion of the deal to 80 percent and won the approval of Anadarko’s board. 



Some of its own shareholders, however, were not particularly happy about the news. Activist investor Carl Icahn was among the most vocal ones and he launched an offensive against the company in a bid to ensure no more deals of this size are possible. The offensive envisages the replacement of four board members and the amendment of Oxy’s charter.Related: 1 Million Bpd At Risk In Gulf Of Mexico Tropical Storm“It is important to add new directors to Occidental’s Board of Directors to oversee future extraordinary transactions like the Anadarko transaction and to ensure that they are not consummated without stockholder approval when appropriate,” Icahn told fellow shareholders in June.



Anadarko has almost 250,000 net acres in the Permian, the U.S. star shale play, and the tie-up will cement Occidental’s place as the leader in the region that is driving the so-called second shale revolution.Oxy offered Anadarko shareholders some US$73.46 per share, which represented a 57-percent premium to the stocks’ closing price on April 11, which was the day before Anadarko announced it had reached a takeover agreement with Chevron. Oxy launched its bid for Anadarko almost immediately after that announcement. Chevron, meanwhile, walked away US$1 billion richer from the breakup fee Anadarko owed it for such a case and with a higher share price as traders apparently appreciated the fact that it won’t be spending almost US$50 billion on an acquisition.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Oil Jumps On Hefty Crude DrawA Red Flag For Oil?

Despite President Donald Trump’s insistence that countries should take responsibility for protecting its own oil tankers through the risky Persian Gulf after two tankers were attacked off the coast of Oman and after Wednesday’s incident where Iranian guard boards harassed a British tanker as it went through the Strait of Hormuz.The Iranian Revolutionary Guards denied involvement in the hostilities.US General Mark Milley said in a Senate hearing on Thursday that the US was crucial to ensuring that shipping lanes through the Gulf remained passable, adding that the US was indeed attempting to assemble a coalition to provide military naval escorts for commercial ships running through dangerous waters.



As for the timetable, Milley added that the plan would be developed within a couple of weeks.President Trump had said at the end of June, following the first round of attacks on two oil tankers, that the United States would not protect shipping routes through the Strait of Hormuz for free.“China gets 91% of its Oil from the Straight, Japan 62%, & many other countries likewise. So why are we protecting the shipping lanes for other countries (many years) for zero compensation,” President Trump said in a June tweet.



“All of these countries should be protecting their own ships on what has always been a dangerous journey. We don’t even need to be there in that the U.S. has just become (by far) the largest producer of Energy anywhere in the world! The U.S. request for Iran is very simple - No Nuclear Weapons and No Further Sponsoring of Terror!”Today’s new comments indicates that Washington’s stance may have softened from the hard line President Trump took last month over the responsibility of the United States to ensure safe passage through the world’s most critical oil chokepoint.

Two consumer groups opposed to fossil fuels are calling on California’s Governor Gavin Newsom to fire supervisors at the state agency regulating oil drilling permits over a conflict of interest, after the consumer alliances found records showing that several regulators held shares in oil giants such as Exxon, Chevron, Valero, ConocoPhillips, Shell, and BP, The Desert Sun reports.The groups Consumer Watchdog and FracTracker Alliance found through requests for public records that seven regulators employed by California’s Department of Conservation’s Division of Oil, Gas and Geothermal Resources (DOGGR) responsible for issuing drilling permits had personal investments in oil and gas companies, whose permits they are essentially regulating.Consumer Watchdog and FracTracker Alliance asked Governor Newsom to fire those public servants for conflict of interests and to suspend the issuance of new drilling permits.



“We have uncovered outrageous conflicts of interest at the state agency charged with oil and gas well approval and inspections that endanger the public. Oil regulators should not be invested in the same oil companies that they regulate,” Consumer Watchdog president Jamie Court and the organization’s senior consumer advocate Adam Scow, as well as FracTracker Alliance’s executive director Brook Lenker, wrote, as carried by The Desert Sun.A spokesman for the Newsom office told The Desert Sun that the governor’s office is aware of the allegations and is taking them seriously.“If a public employee is found to have unethically profited from investments in an industry he or she regulates, that’s unacceptable,” the governor’s office spokesman Brian Ferguson told The Desert Sun.  



One of the seven officials who had disclosed investments in oil firms responded to the outlet’s request for comment. The state agency’s deputy director of programs, David Gutierrez, told The Desert Sun that when he was hired less than two years ago, he told DOGGR officials that he held shares in Exxon and Magellan Midstream Partners and asked if he should divest those shares. Gutierrez was told he needn’t divest because California doesn’t regulate those two companies. After the two consumer groups requested information from the agency about the public records in late April, Gutierrez immediately sold the stocks and consulted the legal and ethics offices who told him “don’t worry about it,” the official told The Desert Sun.

Phillips 66 will be temporarily closing down its 253,600-bpd Alliance, Louisiana, refinery ahead of possible flooding from a tropical storm in the Gulf of Mexico which is expected to become a hurricane on Friday and which has already shut in 32 percent of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico’s oil production.Phillips 66 said on Thursday that it planned to complete the closing of the refinery in the morning, following mandatory evacuation orders from local authorities, Reuters reports.



According to the National Weather Service forecast as of 11:08 a.m. EDT on Thursday, the tropical storm Barry may strengthen to a hurricane on Friday evening.The closing down of the refinery comes after oil producers in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico started earlier this week evacuating employees from their platforms ahead of the storm. Chevron is evacuating all the staff from five platforms and shutting them down ahead of the storm, and also evacuating some non-essential personnel from a sixth platform. Shell is evacuating four platforms—Appomattox, Mars, Olympus and Ursa—and has reduced production from the Mars and Olympus platforms by more than 2,500 bpd. BP is evacuating staff from four platforms that collectively produce over 300,000 bpd of oil and gas. BHP, for its part, is reducing production at two platforms, with the evacuation of staff from Neptune and Shenzi expected to wrap up by this afternoon.



Based on operator reports, the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) estimated that as of July 10, 31.89 percent of the current oil production in the Gulf of Mexico had been shut-in, which is equal to 602,715 bpd. BSEE also estimated that some 17.85 percent of the natural gas production, or 496.2 million cubic feet per day in the Gulf of Mexico, has been shut-in ahead of the storm.Collectively, a total of 1 million bpd of oil production could be at risk due to the storm, according to analysts.

China State Construction Engineering Corporation is looking for opportunities in Iraq’s oil industry and believes it could sign at least one contract per year for oil infrastructure in Iraq, Yu Tao, the head of the Middle Eastern division of the Chinese construction giant, told Reuters on Thursday.“We are paying more attention to the oilfields because that is the core business of Iraq,” Yu said.The Chinese state construction firm is interested in oil pipeline projects in Iraq, according to the official.



More oil pipelines in Iraq and out of Iraq could help the country secure some alternative export routes for its crude oil because currently, most of its oil exports have to pass through the Strait of Hormuz, the most important oil chokepoint in the world with daily oil flows averaging 21 million bpd, or the equivalent of about 21 percent of global petroleum liquids consumption.Currently, the operating pipelines that bypass the Strait of Hormuz are just three—two in Saudi Arabia and one in the UAE—with combined capacity at 6.8 million bpd, not nearly enough to compensate for a disruption of supplies through the Strait of Hormuz should tensions in the Middle East further escalate.For Iraq, the Persian Gulf and then the Strait of Hormuz, which Iran has repeatedly threatened to block, are the key export routes of more than 3 million bpd of Iraqi crude oil from its southern ports lying on the Persian Gulf.



Cutting off Iraq’s crude oil exports would be disastrous for the country, which relies very much on oil revenues for its budget income, so the Persian Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz are the lifelines of Iraqi state revenues, industry analyst Ruba Husari told AFP in June.Earlier this week, as tensions continue to flare up in the Middle East, Iraq’s Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi warned that any disruption in the oil exports flowing through the Strait of Hormuz would be a “major obstacle” for Iraq’s economy.  By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Oil & Gas Discoveries Rise In High-Risk Oil FrontiersOPEC: This Is Where Most New Oil Will Come From In 2020Iran Tries To Seize British Oil Tanker

OPEC’s oil production dropped by another 68,000 bpd to 29.83 million bpd in June, as output from Iran and Libya—exempt from the production cut pact—and other members offset large increases in Saudi Arabia and Nigeria.According to secondary sources in OPEC’s closely watched Monthly Oil Market Report published on Thursday, the cartel’s output hit a new low in recent years and was at the lowest in five years in June, just ahead of OPEC and its allies rolling over the production cuts into March 2020.OPEC’s official figures are very close to last week’s Reuters survey, which showed that OPEC pumped 29.60 million bpd in June, the lowest monthly output since April 2014.



Last month, the largest drop in production was registered in Iran, whose crude oil production fell by 142,000 bpd to 2.225 million bpd, due to the U.S. sanctions on its industry. Iran’s production is now more than a million barrels per day down from its 2018 average of 3.553 million bpd, according to OPEC’s secondary sources, which the cartel uses as a benchmark to report production and compliance with the deal.Iran has stopped supplying directly reported figures to OPEC regarding its production.Production in Libya and Angola also fell significantly last month, by 58,000 bpd and 57,000 bpd from May, respectively. Venezuela booked another decline, by 16,000 bpd, bringing its crude oil production to just 734,000 bpd in June.Related: Pennsylvania Willing To Let Shuttered Oil Refinery Die



Among OPEC’s members who boosted production, Nigeria led the increases with 129,000 bpd in June over May, while the largest producer Saudi Arabia raised its crude oil production by 126,000 bpd to 9.813 million bpd, still cutting more than its quota of 10.311 million bpd under the pact.In July and August, Saudi Arabia is determined to keep its oil production below 10 million bpd and average monthly exports at below 7 million bpd, to “avoid excess stock building, particularly in oversupplied markets,” a Saudi source told Argus on Thursday.Based on OPEC’s oil market outlook for 2020 in this month’s report, the cartel expects demand for its crude next year to be lower than its current production and to average 29.3 million bpd, down by around 1.3 million bpd from 2019. By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Virgin Galactic Looks To Go Public In $800 Million DealOPEC Plans Move To Seize Market Share From US ShaleThe Biggest Oil & Gas Winners In Q2 2019

The Pennsylvania government will not finance the recovery of the largest refinery on the U.S. East Coast, which suffered a devastating string of explosions late last month.“The administration does not plan expending any funding to maintain the site as a refinery,” the Pennsylvania Governor’s spokesman said in a statement quoted by Reuters.Philadelphia Energy Solutions’ refinery complex has a total refining capacity of 335,000 bpd and is the largest such complex on the U.S. Eastern seaboard, according to PES’s website. The explosions rocked the facility an early morning on June 20th.



It was  the second fire in a month at the same refinery complex. On June 10, a fire broke out at the Philadelphia Energy Solutions Refining Complex, affecting the facility’s 50,000-bpd catalytic cracking unit.At the time of the second fire, deputy fire commissioner Craig Murphy, a vat of butane ignited and eventually exploded, according to a report by NBC Philadelphia. The fire spread through the pipes in the complex, causing a series of smaller explosions. However, the cause has not yet been established categorically and the investigation is ongoing. It could take several months to finalize.Justifying the Governor’s decision to not spend money on repairing the facility, spokesman J.J. Abbott said, “In addition to the damage to the facility, there are outstanding questions about safety and contamination. Furthermore, the facility faces competitive challenges against more modern refineries that would be extremely costly and difficult to overcome.”



That’s a marked departure from the last time the PES refinery was threatened by a shutdown, less than a decade ago. At the time, Reuters recalls, both city and state politicians agreed to provide support for the refinery and keep it running. Now, employees blame the Governor for letting the refinery shut down, which, they say, would cost not just the loss of jobs but also tax revenues.Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:The World’s First Trillion Dollar Oil Company Has A Big ProblemA Red Flag For Oil?

Iran will offer oil futures to interested foreign parties at pre-determined rates, the Tehran Times reported on Wednesday, citing Iranian VP Es’haq Jahangiri, despite US sanctions that have restricted oil exports in the OPEC-member country.The United States told all Iranian crude oil buyers that they had to wrap up crude oil purchases by November 2018, but it later granted eight countries waivers to the sanctions. Still, Iran has been defiant regarding the sanctions, and has continued to ship crude oil to several countries including China.The call to foreign buyers sent a clear message that Iran is not yet ready to sit idle while the US strives to bring iran’s oil exports to zero. “Any powerful country that wishes to work with Iran can pre-order Iran’s oil for the next two to three years,” Jahangiri said.



Iran has also tried its hand at selling its crude oil on the country’s stock exchange, the IRENEX.“Offering oil and gas condensate in the international ring of IRENEX has become a legal obligation, and it will definitely be a lasting move,” Amir Hossein Tebyanian, representative for the National Iranian Oil Company told the Tehran Times earlier this week.Iran has had limited success at finding buyers for its crude on this exchange, leaving Iran in a lurch coming off of its pre-sanctions $100+ billion in annual revenues from its crude oil sales.



Iran promised reliability to any foreign buyers of its crude, stating that it had maintained its oil production at 3 million to 4 million bpd despite the sanctions. According to OPEC’s most recent Monthly Oil Market Report, however, Iran’s average crude oil production in May was 2.37 million bpd according to secondary sources. Iran has not provided directly communicated oil production figures to OPEC since some time in 2018.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Here’s Putin’s Answer To The U.S. Shale BoomTwo Factors That Point To A Bearish 2020 For OilGoldman Sachs: Shale Boom Caps Real Oil Price Gains Until 2020

Russia’s second-largest oil producer, Lukoil, has fully restored the volume of its oil supplies to customers after a major contamination on the Druzhba oil pipeline disrupted Russian crude supply to the west for weeks in the spring.  Lukoil redistributed its supplies through other export channels, including ports, “which made it possible to avoid negative consequences in executing export contracts,” Lukoil’s First Vice President, Vadim Vorobyov, told Russian news agency TASS on Wednesday.At the end of April, Russia halted supplies via the Druzhba oil pipeline to several European countries due to a contamination issue, which the Russians said was deliberate.    



The oil was contaminated with organic chlorine, a substance used in oil production to boost output but dangerous in high amounts for refining equipment. The amounts of the chemical were found to be at levels much higher than the maximum allowable amount.“On the part of Lukoil’s permanent western partners — oil buyers on the southern branch of Druzhba and those from Belarus — there are currently no complaints about quality inconsistency of the supplied oil with the agreed parameters,” the manager told TASS today.  Last Friday, just days after Russia had said it had fully resumed oil flows to Europe via the Druzhba pipeline, a Shell oil refinery in Schwedt,  Germany, halted imports via the pipeline because, again, slightly higher concentration of organic chlorine was found in the crude, a Shell spokesman told German business daily Handelsblatt.



On Tuesday, a Shell spokeswoman told German media that flows from the Druzhba pipeline to the PCK refinery in Schwedt resumed on Saturday after a one-day halt on Friday. The refinery is back to normal operations, the spokeswoman said, without commenting on the matter further.Also on Tuesday, an executive at Polish pipeline operator PERN said that flows via the Druzhba pipeline could be suspended again because of higher than normal levels of organic chlorine.“I would really like it not to be the case, but... there will always be remaining oil which could have higher chloride content,” Reuters quoted PERN’s chief executive Igor Wasilewski as saying yesterday.  By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Here’s Putin’s Answer To The U.S. Shale BoomA Red Flag For Oil?

Despite the ongoing rush to build oil pipelines to carry crude from the Permian to the Gulf Coast and an overbuild in the short-term, the fastest-growing U.S. shale play will need additional pipeline capacity up to 500,000 bpd by the end of 2030 to ship soaring crude output to markets, Wood Mackenzie said in new research this week.Midstream operators are set to add 4 million bpd of Permian-to-Gulf Coast pipeline capacity by the end of 2022, creating a moderate overbuild in takeaway capacity in the early 2020s, according to the energy consultancy.  However, WoodMac believes that even after the current build-out is completed, the Permian will still need at least 300,000-500,000 bpd of crude takeaway capacity in the long-term, by 2030, and cited three reasons for its forecast.



First, WoodMac expects resilient Permian basin oil production to continue into the 2030s. Next, between 2021 and the middle of the 2030s, pipeline capacity will fill up on routes to export destinations. And third, the long-haul capacity out of the Permian will need a slight boost in the early 2030s, according to Wood Mackenzie.Currently, “The rapid addition of pipeline capacity will result in two to three years of overbuild, before normal long-haul capacity supply and demand conditions begin to re-emerge,” the consultancy said.“As production growth expands well into the 2030s, US Gulf Coast-bound pipeline capacity will tighten. By the mid-2030s, Permian-to-Gulf Coast pipeline utilisation will surpass 92% in the absence of further investment, necessitating pipeline expansions or greenfield capacity,” said John Coleman, principal analyst, North America crude markets at WoodMac.



Production outpaced pipeline takeaway capacity in the Permian in early 2018, which weighed heavily on the Midland oil prices compared to other U.S. benchmarks. Companies are currently rushing to complete and place into service more pipelines to relieve the bottlenecks, and some are converting pipelines from shipping natural gas liquids (NGL) to crude oil to further ease the takeaway capacity congestion.  By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Oil Jumps On Hefty Crude DrawRussia’s Oil Production Drops To Nearly Three-Year LowVirgin Galactic Looks To Go Public In $800 Million Deal

Three Italians—including a close aide to Italy’s far-right Deputy Prime Minister and Interior Minister Matteo Salvini—and three Russians allegedly held a meeting in Moscow last October to plan an oil deal at discounted prices, with the discount of US$65 million to be allegedly channeled to fund Salvini’s far-right Lega party, BuzzFeed News reported on Wednesday, claiming it has the transcript of the meeting.The meeting in October in a Moscow hotel was not attended by Salvini, but Giancluca Savoini, a close aide to Italy’s far-right leader and deputy prime minister, was in attendance and discussed with the other five people how to turn an apparent oil deal between Italian and Russian companies via intermediaries into a channel to fund (illicitly under Italian law) the Lega party ahead of the European elections this past May, according to the audio and the transcript that BuzzFeed News has published.The names of the companies Eni of Italy, and Rosneft and Lukoil from Russia, as well as oil trader Trafigura, are mentioned in various suggestions on how to structure the oil deal, according to the transcript that BuzzFeed News published today.  



The BuzzFeed report naturally drew reactions in Italy.Matteo Renzi of the opposition Democratic Party and former Italian prime minister between 2014 and 2016 reacted to the BuzzFeed News report, tweeting that “it’s either fake news or a sensational scoop. Using Russian oil to finance the Lega? Sounds crazy. Salvini is the only one who could shed light on this: and he should, immediately.”Nicola Zingaretti, the secretary of the Democratic Party, reacted with a tweet: “Russian rubles to the Lega for an election campaign against the euro? Everything should be clarified immediately.” 



Salvini and Savoini denied the allegations and Salvini said he was ready to sue for libel.“I have sued before, I’ll to it today too: I have never taken a single ruble, a euro, a dollar, or a liter of vodka in financing from Russia,” Salvini said, as carried by Italian media.“There have never been either funds or money for the Lega from anyone quoted by BuzzFeed,” Savoini told Italian news outlet Adnkronos.

India continues to hold technical and commercial discussions with Westinghouse for arriving at a project proposal for nuclear reactors in the state of Andhra Pradesh, Jitendra Singh, Minister of State for Prime Minister’s Office, said on Wednesday in response to a question in Parliament.India and Westinghouse have been negotiating the U.S. supply of nuclear reactors for more than a decade, and earlier this year, India and the United States committed to building six nuclear power plants in India as part of strengthening their civil nuclear cooperation and security.Over the past decade, talks have been stalled by the Indian legislation on liability in case of accidents, which differs from international norms under which liability is for the operator of a nuclear plant rather than the facility’s builder.



Westinghouse filing for bankruptcy protection in 2017 also stalled discussions.  In a question today, India’s minister Singh was asked if India had finalized project proposals with Westinghouse and if the government had assessed potential time and cost overruns due to the fact that Westinghouse was acquired by Brookfield Business Partners in 2018.“The various issues emerging out of the acquisition of WEC have been factored in the discussions,” Singh replied, adding that “presently techno-commercial discussions to arrive at a project proposal for setting up nuclear power reactors in cooperation with M/s. Westinghouse Electric Company (WEC) are still in progress.”



Before Westinghouse was bought by Brookfield Business Partners in August 2018, U.S. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry said in April last year that Westinghouse was now “lean and mean and ready to get to work” on the Indian nuclear power plant projects.Before visiting India last month, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said:“On energy, we want to complete the Westinghouse civil nuclear project, and deliver more LNG and crude. These steps will give Indians reliable, affordable, diversified energy independence so they will no longer have to rely on difficult regimes like those in Venezuela and in Iran.”By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:U.S. Increases Dominance In Natural Gas, Produces More Than Entire Middle EastOil Jumps On Hefty Crude DrawA Red Flag For Oil?

China will raise the retail ceilings of gasoline by CNY150/mt and diesel by CNY140/mt on July 10 (Wednesday), as international crude prices have rebounded in this pricing cycle, according to industry sources.Accordingly, there will be a boost of CNY0.11/liter ($0.06/US gallon) in the retail price of national standard 89-RON gasoline, CNY0.12/liter in 92-RON gasoline and CNY0.12/liter in zero-pour-point diesel, JLC data shows.The price hike on Wednesday will be the 13th price adjustment so far this year, also the ninth price rise. After the markup, the retail ceilings of standard 89-RON gasoline will range between CNY8,185/mt and CNY8,625/mt, and those of standard zero-pour-point diesel will rally to CNY7,310-7,650/mt.



As of July 9, the tenth working day in this pricing cycle for China's gasoline and diesel retail ceilings, the crude basket JLC selects to indicate fluctuations in international crude prices has gained 4.21% from the previous pricing cycle to $62.37/bbl, JLC data shows.Domestic gasoline and diesel prices have recently climbed because of improving market fundamentals. The wholesale prices of 92-RON gasoline settled at CNY5,950-6,150/mt in north, east and south China and Shandong on July 9, up by CNY50-250/mt from June 26, JLC data shows. Meanwhile, the wholesale prices of diesel gained CNY50-200/mt to CNY6,000-6,650/mt. Gasoline prices are still below those of diesel, and the price spread hit CNY500/mt in some regions, which is a stark contrast to relatively high gasoline prices in past years.The country last adjusted fuel prices on June 26, cutting the retail ceilings of gasoline by CNY120/mt and diesel by CNY115/mt.  



According to China's current gasoline and diesel pricing mechanism, which has been in place since January 2016, the country will adjust fuel prices every 10 working days in line with the fluctuation in international crude prices in the range of $40-130/bbl. It will not adjust fuel prices if crude futures prices are above $130/bbl or below $40/bbl or the resulting price change is less than CNY50/mt, or roughly $1/bbl.By JLC InternationalMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Increasingly Weak Demand Outlook Caps Oil PricesVirgin Galactic Looks To Go Public In $800 Million DealGeopolitical Tensions Put A Floor Under Oil Prices

Oil producers in the U.S. part of the Gulf of Mexico have begun evacuating employees from their platforms ahead of a possible storm that is for now a tropical depression, Reuters reports, adding the storm could develop by this evening or tomorrow.Among the companies that have started moving staff from the Gulf are Shell, Chevron, BP, and BHP, while Exxon is keeping an eye on the weather developments for the time being to establish which of its platforms could find themselves in the way of the storm.



Chevron is evacuating all the staff from five platforms and shutting them down ahead of the storm, and also evacuating some non-essential personnel from a sixth platform. Shell is evacuating four platforms--Appomattox, Mars, Olympus and Ursa—and has reduced production from the Mars and Olympus platforms by more than 2,500 bpd. BP is evacuating staff from four platforms that collectively produce over 300,000 bpd of oil and gas. BHP, for its part, is reducing production at two platforms, with the evacuation of staff from Neptune and Shenzi expected to wrap up by this afternoon.Earlier this week, the Colorado State University updated its forecast for this hurricane season and now expect 14 named storms, six hurricanes, and two major hurricanes. While the update is unchanged from last month’s forecast, it does feature more than the average number of named storms per hurricane season, which is twelve. Six hurricanes is the average number per season, and of these, an average of three become major hurricanes of Category 3 or more.



The outlook of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration forecasts 9 to 15 named storms this hurricane season, 4 to 8 hurricanes, and 2 to 4 major hurricanes.The Gulf of Mexico accounts for some 17 percent of U.S. oil production. Last year, hurricane Michael shut in production of more than 700,000 bpd for a few days. The year before, however, hurricane season was a lot more devastating: total losses for the oil industry—production and refining—hit US$200 billion, which became the highest storm bill in history.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Increasingly Weak Demand Outlook Caps Oil PricesVirgin Galactic Looks To Go Public In $800 Million DealGeopolitical Tensions Put A Floor Under Oil Prices

The American Petroleum Institute (API) reported a huge crude oil inventory draw of 8.129 million barrels for the week ending July 4, compared to analyst expectations of a smaller 3.081-million barrel draw.Last week, the API reported a draw of 5 million barrels. A day later, the EIA estimated a much smaller inventory drawdown of 1.1 million barrels.The net build is just 13.56 million barrels for the 28-week reporting period so far this year, using API data.


Oil prices were up on Tuesday as the market grows increasingly leery of the mounting tensions in the Middle East that continue to threaten the world’s transport of crude.  At 4:01pm EST, WTI was trading up by $0.31 (+0.54%) at $57.97—less than a $1.00 over last week’s levels—a surprisingly low rise given the tumultuous times in the Middle East. Brent was trading down $0.17 (+0.27%) at $64.28—up almost $1 over this time last weekThe API this week reported a 257,000-barrel draw in gasoline inventories for week ending July 4. Analysts estimated a larger draw in gasoline inventories of 1.301-million barrels for the week.Distillate inventories grew by 3.690 million barrels for the week, while inventories at Cushing fell by 754,000 barrels.



US crude oil production as estimated by the Energy Information Administration showed that production for the week ending June 28 rose slightly this week to 12.2 million bpd, just 200,000 bpd off the all-time high of 12.4 million bpd.The U.S. Energy Information Administration report on crude oil inventories is due to be released at its regularly scheduled time on Wednesday at 10:30a.m. EST.By 4:37pm EST, WTI was trading at $58.05 while Brent traded at $64.34.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Here’s Putin’s Answer To The U.S. Shale BoomTwo Factors That Point To A Bearish 2020 For OilGoldman Sachs: Shale Boom Caps Real Oil Price Gains Until 2020

Any disruption in the oil exports flowing through the Strait of Hormuz will be a “major obstacle” for Iraq’s economy, Iraq’s Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi said on Tuesday as tensions continue to flare up in the Middle East, Reuters reported on Tuesday.Iraq has been studying ways around the vital chokepoint for oil exports for some time, but its options for doing so are limited.Iraq has the fourth largest oil reserves in OPEC, behind Saudi Arabia and Iran and Venezuela—the latter two which remain under strict US sanctions with their oil exports. Iraq is OPEC’s second largest producer and relies heavily on these oil exports—as do most OPEC nations—and any disruption to its oil revenues would be of grave consequence. Its oil industry provides the country with 89% of its revenue, according to the EIA.



Iran has threatened to close the Strait on numerous occasions in response to US or EU actions.Most of Iraq’s oil is shipped through southern terminals, Abdul Mahdi said. Iraq’s landlocked positioning in the Gulf means that all of its southern exports must travel through the precarious Strait of Hormuz.US President Donald Trump has vowed that if Iran did manage to close the Strait of Hormuz, that it “wouldn’t be closed for long.” He later added that the United States wasn’t up for protecting oil tankers in these increasingly dangerous shipping lanes forever, or for free.



“China gets 91% of its Oil from the Straight, Japan 62%, & many other countries likewise. So why are we protecting the shipping lanes for other countries (many years) for zero compensation,” President Trump tweeted at the end of June as tensions started to run high after two oil tankers were attacked in the Gulf of Oman.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Here’s Putin’s Answer To The U.S. Shale BoomTwo Factors That Point To A Bearish 2020 For OilGoldman Sachs: Shale Boom Caps Real Oil Price Gains Until 2020

Chevron said that a group of Ecuadorian plaintiffs had dismissed their only remaining lawsuit against the U.S. supermajor that sought to enforce a US$9.5-billion judgment over water and land pollution handed in Ecuador in 2011 but exposed by Chevron as having been obtained via corruption.The group of Ecuadorian plaintiffs ended their Canadian lawsuit against Chevron and agreed to pay costs to Chevron, the U.S. oil firm said in a statement on Monday.After dismissals of the Ecuadorian plaintiffs’ claims in Argentina and Brazil, and rulings against them in Gibraltar and the United States, Chevron moved to dismiss the Canadian lawsuit.



“The Ecuadorian plaintiffs and their counsel did not oppose Chevron’s motion to dismiss and instead consented to the unconditional and final dismissal of the lawsuit,” the U.S. oil major said.“Chevron is pleased that the promoters of the fraudulent scheme have apparently realized that no legitimate court would enforce the judgment that they purchased in Ecuador. Chevron will continue its efforts to hold the lawyers and investors behind this fraudulent scheme accountable,” said R. Hewitt Pate, Chevron’s vice president and general counsel.In April this year, the Supreme Court of Canada refused to hear a request to review a lower court decision, rendering a final verdict that dismissed all claims against Chevron Canada Limited.Related: China’s Fight Against Pollution To Generate Billions In Extra Solar Income



Back in 2016, a U.S. appeals court blocked the enforcement of the $9.5 billion judgment handed down by an Ecuadorian court against Chevron. The U.S. appeals court supported a lower court ruling in 2014 that found that the case against Chevron, initiated in an Ecuadorean court, was the product of fraud and racketeering, complete with fraudulent evidence and bribery of the Ecuadorean judge.Undeterred by the two lower court rulings in the United States, the case was submitted to the US Supreme court, which refused to hear the appeal. The plaintiffs also tried their hand in Gibraltar, Brazil, and Argentina, also to no avail. Even the Hague has heard the case. It, too, ruled in Chevron’s favor, saying that the fraudulent Ecuadorian judgment “violates international public policy” and “should not be recognised or enforced by the courts of other States.” By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:OPEC Wants Quick Resolution To Tensions Between US And Iran, VenezuelaHere’s Putin’s Answer To The U.S. Shale BoomTwo Factors That Point To A Bearish 2020 For Oil

Egypt seized a Ukrainian oil tanker carrying Iranian crude while it was crossing the Suez Canal ten days ago, according to a report from Arab news outlet Al-Araby Al-Jadeed carried by Middle East Monitor.If confirmed, this would be the second detention of a tanker carrying Iranian oil over the past two weeks.Last week, Gibraltar detained a super tanker carrying crude oil to Syria because it had “reasonable grounds” to believe that the Grace 1 ship was violating European Union sanctions against Syria.



Shipping data that Reuters has reviewed suggests that the tanker en route to Syria was loaded with Iranian oil off the Iranian coast. Yet, the tanker documents point that the oil comes from Iraq, according to Reuters.If the tanker indeed loaded oil from Iran, it was not only in breach of EU sanctions on the Syrian entity owning the refinery believed to be the destination of the oil, but it also violated the U.S. sanctions on Iran’s oil exports.Earlier this week, the Government of Gibraltar confirmed that the Iranian supertanker allegedly on its way to Syria was fully laden with 2 million barrels of crude oil.



“Her Majesty's Government of Gibraltar can now confirm, after having received the results of comprehensive laboratory testing, that the Very Large Crude Carrier, the Grace 1, which was detained in the early hours of Thursday morning, is loaded to capacity with crude oil,” Gibraltar said on Monday.The report of the detention of another tanker loaded with Iranian oil—the one seized by Egyptian authorities—came a day after an Egyptian court sentenced an Al-Azhar professor and five other defendants on charges of spying for Iran. The Al-Azhar professor, Alaa Moawad, attended the trial and was sentenced to 15 years in prison and a fine, while the five other defendants, tried in absentia, were jailed for life.  By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:China’s Fight Against Pollution To Generate Billions In Extra Solar IncomeThe Biggest Oil & Gas Winners In Q2 2019Persian Gulf Conflict Could Send Oil Beyond $325

Iran’s ‘misery index’—an informal measure of an economy that adds inflation to the unemployment rate—more than doubled this past winter, jumping to 39 percent from 19.4 percent in the previous winter, and is likely to further spike as the U.S. sanctions are crippling the Iranian economy and its main export revenue generator, oil.According to data from the Statistical Center of Iran (SCI), cited by the National Council of Resistance of Iran, the fourth quarter of Iran’s calendar year—December 2018 through March 2019—saw inflation rate surging to 26.9 percent and unemployment rate at 12.1 percent.After March, Iran’s inflation in the spring further soared and stood at 37.6 percent in June, according to the National Council of Resistance of Iran.



The ‘misery index’ is set to further increase after the U.S. removed all sanction waivers for Iranian oil buyers, leading to another plunge in Iran’s exports.One week before the end of June, Iran’s oil exports were estimated to have dropped to 300,000 bpd or lower, Reuters reported, citing industry sources and tanker data. Iranian exports in May are estimated at 400,000 bpd-500,000 bpd.Iran’s economy contracted by 4.9 percent in the 2018-2019 year ended in March, slipping further into recession as diminishing oil exports due to the U.S. sanctions are depriving the Islamic Republic of its economic lifeline—oil revenues.



The 4.9-percent contraction between March 2018 and March 2019, reported by the Statistical Center of Iran, is likely to worsen further as the U.S. removed all sanction waivers for Iranian oil buyers as of May 2.According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Iran’s economy is expected to shrink by 6 percent this year, while the annual inflation will spike to 37.2 percent.  A World Bank report from June showed that Iran’s annual inflation had risen sharply from about 10 percent in the middle of 2018 to about 52 percent in April 2019, “contributed by a depreciation of the rial in the parallel market of more than two-fold compared to levels prior to the announcement of U.S. sanctions in April 2018.” By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Shale Boom Reshuffles Global Top 50 Oil & Gas ListHere’s Putin’s Answer To The U.S. Shale BoomTwo Factors That Point To A Bearish 2020 For Oil

China’s efforts to reduce some of the world’s worst air pollution are having a bonus positive effect: they are improving the country’s potential to generate solar power as more sunlight reaches the surface of the planet in that part of the world.Reuters reports that a team of researchers had calculated that China’s photovoltaic potential fell by about 15 percent between 1960 and 2015 because of growing pollution. As a result, by 2016 China was missing out on generating as much as 14 TWh of electricity from solar installations annually, Gizmodo reported, citing the research. That’s enough to power 1.3 households and it also cost local utilities almost US$2 billion in lost power output.



Now that the government is actively working to reduce it, China could reverse the decline, boosting its solar power generation potential by 12-13 percent. This means that the country could boost its solar power output by 74 TWh by 2030. To utilities, this would mean an additional US$6.7 billion in profits over the period.China is the world’s leader in renewable capacity, especially in solar. According to Reuters, its installed solar capacity at the end of last year stood at 170 GW, representing about 9 percent of its total power generation capacity. Power output from solar installations in 2018 hit 177.5 TWh, which amounted to 2.5 percent of the national power output.



Yet even China’s ambitious solar plans hit a snag when it became clear Beijing is paying too much in subsidies as it set no limits to the amount of new solar capacity installed or its cost-competitiveness with alternative energy systems. As a result, last year China shocked the global solar industry by announcing it would not issue approvals for any new solar power installations by the end of 2018 and would also cut the feed-in tariff subsidy that has been a major driver of the solar business in the country that accounts for as much as 50 percent of capacity.This has spurred more cost-cutting efforts in the local solar industry with many projects now on par with fossil fuel power plants.By Irina Slav for Oilrpice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Here’s Putin’s Answer To The U.S. Shale BoomTwo Factors That Point To A Bearish 2020 For OilGoldman Sachs: Shale Boom Caps Real Oil Price Gains Until 2020

A group of First Nations has oil and gas pipeline plans that would certainly raise hackles in British Columbia and the group is intent on making them happen despite new legislation that has put a spoke in the wheels of any future energy infrastructure project involving B.C. coast.The Calgary Herald reports that the Eagle Spirit Energy Corridor will consist of two oil pipelines and two natural gas pipelines and will carry the commodities from northern Alberta to the B.C. coast. It is being pushed forward by a group of more than 35 First Nations, which yesterday filed a request for guidance with the National Energy Board regarding the Eagle Spirit Corridor description requirements. The pipelines will have a combined capacity of up to 4 million bpd.“We need some clarification, since we now have Bill C-48 and Bill C-69 in place, on what the process is…and whether our project will be exempted for (moving) partially upgraded bitumen,” the chairman of the group’s council, Calvin Helin, told the Calgary Herald, adding, however, that, “Our project is going ahead, no matter what they say.”



The Canadian Senate voted in June to keep a ban on oil tankers—bill C-48—in the northern part of British Columbia. The legislators also voted in favor of Bill C-69, which concerns infrastructural projects such as pipelines. Both the tanker bill, C-48, and the pipeline bill, C-69, will make it even harder for the oil industry to boost exports at a time when there is growing hunger for Canadian heavy crude.The First Nations behind the Eagle Spirit Energy Corridor have a second option, however. If they can’t move the oil and gas from Alberta to B.C., they will move them to Alaska instead, Helin told the Calgary Herald.Earlier this year, another group of First Nations announced plans to buy into the controversial Trans Mountain pipeline project that pitted Alberta against British Columbia, the latter adamant about not letting any more oil pass through its territory. There was even talk of buying a majority stake in the project.



According to the Calgary herald’s Chris Varcoe, a growing number of First Nations are realizing the economic benefits of new energy infrastructure projects.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Here’s Putin’s Answer To The U.S. Shale BoomTwo Factors That Point To A Bearish 2020 For OilGoldman Sachs: Shale Boom Caps Real Oil Price Gains Until 2020

OPEC has asked on Monday for a timely settlement to the tensions that have flared up between the United States and Iran and Venezuela, Anadolu Agency reported on Monday, citing This Day.Iran and Venezuela, both founding members of OPEC, are both exempt once again from the production cut extensions that the cartel announced last week, and will remain exempt for as long as they remain under sanction.



Both Iran’s and Venezuela’s production woes have contributed significantly to the cartel’s overcompliance to the group’s production cut quota, with Iran’s crude production falling from an average of 3.813 million barrels per day in 2017 to 2.370 million barrels per day in May 2019, and Venezuela’s crude production falling from 1.911 million bpd on average in 2017, to an abysmal 741,000 bpd in May 2019.But while the two countries combined seemingly did OPEC a favor by taking more than 2.6 million barrels of crude oil per day out of the market within that time frame, the tensions in the Persian Gulf and the dire situation in Venezuela are creating a market that OPEC is finding it difficult to both predict and manage.



“For us we will welcome a resolution of the issues that are at stake between these countries and the U.S. sanctions distort markets and further complicate our efforts with non-OPEC members to maintain stability,” OPEC’s Secretary General Mohammad Sanusi Barkindo said on Monday.Though OPEC is hoping—but not holding out for—a swift resolution to two of its founding members’ production problems, the issue is not OPEC’s main concern. OPEC called out last week climate activists as “perhaps the greatest threat to our industry going forward,” Barkindo said last Friday, taking specific aim at the “school strike movement” as well as climate campaigners.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:OPEC Plans Move To Seize Market Share From US ShaleThe Biggest Oil & Gas Winners In Q2 2019Persian Gulf Conflict Could Send Oil Beyond $325

The Government of Gibraltar has confirmed that the Iranian supertanker allegedly on its way to Syria was fully laden with 2 million barrels of crude oil, Reuters reported on Monday.“The results of these tests conclusively prove and confirm the information disseminated last week by the Gibraltar Government and contradict the statements of some commentators from outside the jurisdiction who had speculated that the cargo on the vessel was not crude,” the government spokesman said.



The Panamanian-flagged Grace 1, which was seized last Thursday by the British Royal Marines, was assumed to be carrying crude oil, but some raised doubts. Iran denies that the tanker was on its way to Syria, in defiance of EU sanctions against Syria, and has likened the rather dramatic seizure—reportedly done at the behest of the United States—to “an act of piracy”.Iran alleged on Monday that it is under no obligation to adhere to EU sanctions. “Iran is neither a member of the EU nor subject to any European oil embargo. Last I checked, EU was against extraterritoriality. UK's unlawful seizure of a tanker with Iranian oil on behalf of #B Team is piracy, pure and simple,"" Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif tweeted on Monday. The #B Team referred disparagingly to President Trump’s administration.



Despite some setbacks, Iran remains hopeful that its oil exports will improve, although its oil exports have fallen to below 300,000 bpd–lower than Iran may have anticipated since the sanctions went into effect.This conflict in the Gulf has stoked fears that oil prices could skyrocket should the conflict escalate further, even to as high as $325 per barrel should tanker traffic in the Strait of Hormuz be disrupted, according to a 2018 study by the Riyadh-based King Abdullah Petroleum Studies and Research Center.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:OPEC Plans Move To Seize Market Share From US ShaleThe Biggest Oil & Gas Winners In Q2 2019Persian Gulf Conflict Could Send Oil Beyond $325

Iran has denied China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) a request to suspend work on Phase 11 of the South Pars gas project, aiming for a clear-cut solution to the Chinese role in the huge gas field, Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said over the weekend.“We have to sort out the issue with this country (China), it has to either pull out of the contract, which if so, its share would be transferred to Iran’s Petro Pars,” Iranian media quoted Zanganeh as saying about CNPC’s 80-percent stake in the South Pars Phase 11 development project. At the end of last year, Zanganeh said that CNPC had replaced French oil and gas major Total in Iran’s multi-billion-dollar South Pars gas project.In 2017, Total had become the first supermajor to return to Iran after the previous sanctions were lifted, with the South Pars 11 gas development project.



But after the U.S. withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal, Total said in May last year that it would not be in a position to continue the South Pars 11 project and would have to unwind all related operations before November 4, 2018. Before Total quit Iran, the French company had 50.1 percent in the project and was its operator, while CNPC owned 30 percent, and Petropars—a wholly owned subsidiary of the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC)—held the remaining 19.9 percent.  Earlier this year, a month before the U.S. tightened the screws on Iran’s oil industry by removing all waivers for all Iranian oil buyers, Iran officially launched four new development phases at the South Pars field, which will add 110 million cubic meters to its daily output.Related: The Biggest Oil & Gas Winners In Q2 2019Zanganeh told Iranian state TV on Sunday that he hoped Iran and China would reach a friendly solution to the Chinese work on the South Pars project.“China is a friend of Iran and the latter would not opt for severing ties for foot-dragging in projects. We are seeking alternative solutions,” Iran’s Press-TV quoted Zanganeh as saying.



Referring to Iran’s oil sales, the minister struck a defiant tone, saying that “we are doing our best to defeat the enemies and overcome the current problems in oil sale.”At the end of last month, an analysis by TankerTrackers showed that Iran had delivered the first crude oil to a Chinese refinery complex since the U.S. removed the waivers, in a first independent tanker-tracking confirmation that China is defying the U.S. sanctions on Iran’s oil exports.  By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Is US Shale Cannibalizing Itself?Why OPEC+ Will Outlive ShaleIs This The Last Bottleneck For Nord Stream 2?

Ineos, the operator of the main UK North Sea crude oil transport route, the Forties pipeline, said on Monday that it is progressively reducing to 150,000 bpd the flow on the Forties Pipeline System for repair on one of its three processing units.The Forties pipeline is a key transit route for North Sea oil, and the Forties crude blend is the key component of the Brent-Forties-Oseberg-Ekofisk-Troll (BFOE) complex, which is the basis for the Brent futures contract. The Forties pipeline typically carries around 450,000 bpd, but can transport up to 600,000 bpd of North Sea oil onshore for refining. The pipeline carries around 40 percent of the UK’s oil and gas to the mainland, Ineos says.“An operational issue with the main heater on Train 3 of the pipeline system at Kinneil requires immediate repair,” Ineos said in a statement today, adding that “The progressive reduction of flow through the pipeline is being managed with our customers and their offshore operations through this afternoon.”



Ineos initially expected the reduced flow to be in place for two days until midday on Tuesday UK time, but in Monday’s update, the company said that “based on our current understanding the repair is expected to take two to three days. Our view at the moment is that we would restart train 3 sometime between Wednesday and Friday this week, allowing our customers to ramp up to full rates.”Commenting on the reduced flow at Forties, ING analysts said that they expect limited impact on the oil market if repair works are finished on time. However, “a prolonged period of reduced flows could provide some support to prompt Brent spreads.”  At the end of 2017 and early 2018, a major outage at the Forties pipeline lasted for weeks and rattled the markets.



Earlier this year, Ineos said that it would be investing US$625 million (500 million British pounds) in the Forties Pipeline System, prolonging the life of the North Sea’s main oil and gas artery by at least 20 years into the 2040s.

Iran warned this weekend that it was close to exceeding the level of uranium enrichment agreed under the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, commonly called the Iran nuclear deal. The move, according to S&P Global Platts, aims to spur the European signatories of the JCPOA into action after they failed to find a way to continue supporting Iran after the United States pulled out of the deal last year.""From today, we officially pass the limit of 3.67% for uranium enrichment,” Iran’s government spokesman said yesterday.“Within a few hours, the process of enrichment more than 3.67% [purity] starts,” said the spokesman of the country’s atomic energy organization.



This would be the second time Iran has breached the terms of the JCPOA, after last week it exceeded the limits of uranium stockpiles.The European signatories of the nuclear deal—France, Germany, and the UK—have been trying to keep Iran in line, most recently by setting up a special vehicle aimed at facilitating trade with Iran in the context of U.S. sanctions. However, the vehicle only facilitates trade in goods not covered by the sanctions, which target Iran’s vital oil sector.Naturally, Iran has expressed its dissatisfaction with the arrangement. The country gave the EU 60 days to come up with an effective solution to its oil export problem, and the EU failed to do so.



Matters were made worse after last week the UK seized an Iranian oil tanker carrying oil to Syria, which is under EU sanctions. Before that, tension between the UK and Iran increased after the UK joined the U.S. in its conclusion that no other country but Iran “could plausibly be responsible” for the attacks on two tankers in the Gulf of Oman.In response to the tanker seizure, Iran has threatened to seize a British tanker, with sources from the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps going as far as to say they could ""Potentially stop any tanker headed towards the UK and sailing in the Gulf.""By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Persian Gulf Conflict Could Send Oil Beyond $325Why Natural Gas Prices CollapsedIran’s Best Bet To Avoid U.S. Sanctions

Tankers are shunning the port of Fujairah in the UAE, the main refueling hub of the Middle East, following the two attacks involving tankers in the area in the past six weeks.Bloomberg quotes traders as saying tanker owners were worried about the situation and were opting to refuel elsewhere. The first attack, against four tankers at the port of Fujairah, led to a spike in tensions between the U.S. and Iran even though the investigation into the attacks, carried out by the UAE, Norway, and Saudi Arabia concluded the perpetrator was “a state actor” without naming it. The U.S. blamed it on Iran and Iran denied involvement.



The second attack, in June, was on two tankers in the Gulf of Oman, just outside the Strait of Hormuz. Again, the U.S. and Saudi Arabia blamed Iran for the attacks and Tehran denied the allegations. Naturally, this did not help matters and traders began worrying even more about the security of tanker traffic through the world’s busiest oil chokepoint.There was also concern about spiking tanker insurance premiums that would affect the industry adversely.



“Only expect issues to get worse before they get better,” Bloomberg quoted a fuel broker as saying. The port of Fujairah, Matt Stanley from Dubai-based Star Fuels told Bloomberg, is experiencing “a significant drop in demand owing to war-risk premiums” that insurers were quick to raise after the tanker attacks.Oilprice reported shortly after the second attacks that insurers were already upping premiums and this could have a lasting effect on oil prices. Between the end of May and the middle of June, that is, between the first and the second attacks, tanker insurance premiums jumped by between 5 and 15 percent, according to ship owners. Slackening demand for refueling services in Fujairah only shows this effect would spread in more than one direction.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Is This A Turning Point In Libya’s Civil War?Will OPEC Cuts Trigger New Wave Of US Shale Oil?Oil Markets Not Impressed By Small Crude Draw

Venezuela’s refining complex CRP has been shut down after a blackout that occurred on Sunday, Argus Media reports, citing union officials from the complex as saying the blackout was caused by a “catastrophic failure” in a turbine at the power plant that supplies electricity to CRP.The complex, also called Paraguana Refining Center, consists of two refineries with a combined processing capacity of 955,000 bpd. As Reuters noted in its report of the accident, the complex, like the rest of Venezuela’s processing facilities, has been operating below capacity for several years because of the same operational problems that have plagued Venezuela’s oil industry.Reuters also quoted a refinery employee from the complex as saying restarting operations at CRP would be difficult, which would additionally exacerbate Venezuela’s oil woes, which are already pretty grave.



The United States imposed sweeping sanctions on Venezuela’s oil industry and PDVSA at the end of January to cut off a cash lifeline for Nicolas Maduro and his regime, after Washington recognized opposition leader Juan Guaidó as the legitimate interim president of the Latin American country that sits on the world’s largest crude oil reserves.As a result, production has been falling faster than before and so have exports, especially to the United States. In March, the EIA reported the first week since records began that the U.S. took no Venezuelan crude at all.Blackouts have also become more frequent since Washington slapped the latest round of sanctions on Venezuela. A string of blackouts pretty much crippled the country in March. The oil industry suffered a particularly severe blow from the blackouts with all four upgraders turning the local extra heavy oil into a form more suitable for exports shutting down.



However, despite the persistent operational problems and the decline in production, Venezuelan oil exports have been on the rise as the South American country struggles to keep its end of the oil-for-cash bargain with China. Last month, daily exports rebounded to 1.1 million bpd because of this deal, with the amount going to China at 656,000 bpd.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Is This A Turning Point In Libya’s Civil War?Will OPEC Cuts Trigger New Wave Of US Shale Oil?Oil Markets Not Impressed By Small Crude Draw

A Nigerian court has ordered the seizure of $40 million of luxury items, mainly jewelry and a customized golden iPhone belonging to the ex-minister of Nigeria’s petroleum resources Diezani Alison-Madueke, according to Reuters.In addition to the customized iPhone, the items seized included—but was not limited to—419 bangles, 315 rings, and 189 wristwatches, according to Sahara Reporters. The items will be permanently forfeited to the federal government after a 14-day waiting period. Madueke already had her $37.5 million apartment seized in 2017.The items were seized in connection to a money laundering and bribery case involving former Nigerian President Goodluck Johnathon in the high-profile Malabu oil deal/ OPL 245 case which has embroiled Shell, Eni, and JPMorgan in legal battles in multiple countries across the globe, as well as a case involving Duke Oil Company and Trafigura—the goings on which are murky at best.



Madueke was the head of the petroleum ministry from 2011 until 2015.Nigeria issued an international arrest warrant for Madueke, standing accused of misappropriating public funds. The United Kingdom also wanted a crack at prosecuting the Nigerian oil minister, but her whereabouts are currently unknown. UK detectives were in Nigeria just days ago gathering evidence against the oil minister.Madueke has formerly been in Dominica—the irony of it being a money laundering hotspot not lost—but has also spent time in London, where she was arrested for the same criminal activity in 2015 before being released on bail.



Madueke was the first female president of OPEC.Meanwhile, the offshore oilfield OPL 245 remains one of the largest untapped oil resources in Africa at 9 billion barrels of oil reserves. Eni and Shell still hold the rights to develop the field, but both are named in a $1 billion lawsuit that is unlikely to wrap up quickly.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Shale Boom Reshuffles Global Top 50 Oil & Gas ListOil Prices Set For Worst Weekly Drop In Five WeeksWhy Natural Gas Prices Collapsed

Just days after Russia said it had fully resumed oil flows to Europe via the Druzhba pipeline after a major disruption in supplies due to crude contamination in April, a Shell oil refinery in Germany halted imports via the pipeline because, again, slightly higher concentration of organic chlorine was found in the crude, a Shell spokesman told Germany business daily Handelsblatt on Friday.At the end of April, Russia halted supplies via the Druzhba oil pipeline to several European countries due to a contamination issue, which the Russians said was deliberate.    The oil was contaminated with organic chlorine, a substance used in oil production to boost output but dangerous in high amounts for refining equipment. The amounts of the chemical were found to be at levels much higher than the maximum allowable amount.  



Shell’s refinery PCK in Schwedt, eastern Germany, has stopped importing Russian oil via the Druzhba pipeline again, the company spokesman told Handelsblatt today, just two weeks after normal supply of oil from Russia resumed to the refineries in Schwedt and Leuna in eastern Germany.  The PCK refinery is in contact with suppliers and pipeline operators to clarify what the cause of the higher organic chlorine level is and how to remedy the situation, Shell’s spokesman told the Germany daily.  The refinery continues to operate as alternative crude supply has been sourced from the port of Rostock, the spokesman said. 



The Russian oil supply contamination seriously disrupted the refinery operations of some companies in May. Total, for example, halted some of the units at its 230,000-bpd Leuna refinery in Germany to conduct technical checks.  At the end of May, a month after Russian oil flows through the Druzhba pipeline were suspended due to the contamination, and despite Russia’s assurances that clean oil would resume flowing through the pipeline westward to Europe in the second half of May, analysts and traders said the progress was very slow while costs could be very high.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Iran’s Best Bet To Avoid U.S. SanctionsShale Boom Reshuffles Global Top 50 Oil & Gas ListOil Prices Set For Worst Weekly Drop In Five Weeks

Petrobras is putting up for sale two operating shallow-water offshore gas fields and a deepwater oil exploration concession in the Espírito Santo Basin, as part of efforts to optimize its portfolio and improve capital allocation, Brazil’s state-owned oil and gas firm said on Friday.Petrobras has launched the opportunity disclosure stage—the so-called teaser—for the sale of its 100-percent stakes in the gas fields Peroá and Cangoá, and its 88.9-percent interest in the deepwater Malombe oil field, where oil was discovered in 2011.Spain’s Repsol is currently withdrawing from its 11.1-percent interest in Malombe in favor of Petrobras, and should this transaction be approved and completed, Petrobras will be selling 100 percent in the field, the Brazilian company said.



At the beginning of this year, reports emerged that Brazil was pushing for major state-owned companies, including Petrobras, to privatize some subsidiaries as the Brazilian government of new far-right President Jair Bolsonaro looks to raise US$20 billion in state asset sales in 2019.“The privatization of the company is not in question. I do not have a mandate to think about it,” Petrobras’ new chief executive Roberto Castello Branco—who was tapped by Bolsonaro to lead the company—said in November.Yet, the sale of non-core assets at Petrobras was expected to continue under Castello Branco, whose strategic vision for the company includes “portfolio management, capital cost reduction, and relentless pursuit of cost reduction.”



In late April, Petrobras approved the sale of several refineries as part of its divestment plan, and last month, it struck a deal with the Brazilian antitrust regulator that will allow it to sell those downstream assets in a bid, the company said, to encourage greater competition in the industry.  Earlier this week, Petrobras announced the start of the non-binding phase for the sale of its total equity interest in 14 onshore exploration and production concessions in Bahia state, jointly designated as the Recôncavo Cluster.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:U.S. Shale Industry Faces More HeadwindsIran’s Best Bet To Avoid U.S. SanctionsWhy Natural Gas Prices Collapsed

The military and the opposition, Sudan’s main rival groups since the long-term president was ousted in April, reached on Friday a power-sharing agreement that could stop months of violence in the African oil producer.The army and the opposition agreed to create “a sovereign council by rotation between the military and civilians for a period of three years or slightly more,” Mohamed Hassan Lebatt, mediator for the African Union (AU), said on Friday.  Under the power-sharing agreement, the military will hold the presidency for the first 18 months, and then an administration run by civilians will take over for the remaining 18 months.In early April, Omar al-Bashir, long-term President of Sudan, was toppled from power by the military and placed under “heavy guard”, following months of protests against the government and its handling of a severe economic crisis in the country.



Sudan’s Defense Minister Awad Mohamed Ahmed Ibn Auf said at the time that there would be a two-year transition period of military rule and a council governing the country.Civilians, however, have been protesting since the coup, demanding civilians have a role in governing the country, not only the military.Days before the power-sharing deal was agreed, violent protests killed several people in Sudan.Sudan, a relatively small African oil producer, has been plagued by economic hardships since South Sudan seceded in 2011. South Sudan broke from Sudan that year and took with it around 350,000 bpd in oil production.



After South Sudan’s secession from Sudan, the two countries have been mutually dependent on oil revenues, because the south has 75 percent of the oil reserves, while the north has the only current transport route for the oil to international markets.As of the end of last year, Sudan still hoped that it could be able to increase its crude oil production from 75,000 bpd to 120,000 bpd within a year. The country also targets to start exports of oil within the next three to five years.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Why Natural Gas Prices CollapsedIran’s Best Bet To Avoid U.S. SanctionsCan China’s Rare Earth Monopoly Be Broken?

Siccar Point, one of the largest private equity-backed oil and gas field operators in the North Sea is considering a sale, to be arranged later this year, unnamed industry and banking sources told Reuters.The company has a portfolio with total discovered reserves of 500 million barrels of oil equivalent, with its assets expected to have productive lives of at least 40 years. Most of these discoveries have not yet been tapped for commercial production.In most of these fields, Siccar is only a minority partner, including in the Rosebank field, a promising deepwater field operated by Equinor, in which Suncor is a also a minority partner alongside Siccar Point. The field, one of the largest in the UK continental shelf, has potentially recoverable reserves estimated at more than 300 million barrels of oil equivalent.



Yet the company also has majority stakes in two fields, Cambo and Benbecula. Cambo lies in the Corona Ridge Area where Rosebank is and, according to the Reuters sources, the company has invited investors to review data on the field as it plans to reduce its stake in it. The other 30 percent in Cambo are held by Shell. The field has natural gas reserves seen at 500 billion cu ft.“A Cambo farm down might result in a broader transaction for the company,” one of the Reuters sources said.Siccar Point as a whole could fetch US$2 billion, according to Wood Mackenzie calculations. The firm emerged as one of the main players in the North Sea last year, after it acquired OMV’s operations in the UK for US$1 billion.



The private equity-backed energy independents emerged as the new masters of the North Sea over the last few years as Big Oil began streamlining portfolios, focusing only on the highest-yield, fastest-return projects. Some of them, according to Reuters, have plans to go public at some point but they might not rush to execute these plans as investors are growing increasingly wary amid highly volatile oil prices.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Can China’s Rare Earth Monopoly Be Broken?The Libya Conflict Just Took A Very Dangerous TurnThese 12 U.S. States Just Hiked Gasoline Taxes

PetroChina started to give its subsidiaries subsidies to export gasoline each month as the domestic supply glut is worsening amid increased production, market sources said.Domestic gasoline supply increased after Hengli Petrochemical saw its refining complex coming on stream at the end of 2018. Hengli and Zhejiang Petrochemical, which put its refining complex into production at the beginning of 2019, could produce much more gasoline than diesel on lower gasoline and diesel output ratios.China's gasoline output was about 59.13 million mt in the first five months of 2019, up by 1.85 million mt or 3.23% from the same period last year; meanwhile, diesel output dropped by 6.59 million mt or 8.87% to 67.73 million mt.



Domestic gasoline demand growth, however, slowed down since 2018, when automobile sales posted negative increases and did not improve in 2019. The demand was also affected by the fast development of new energy vehicles.During January-May 2019, China's gasoline exports amounted to 5.78 million mt, down by 7.5% year on year.In May, domestic wholesale gasoline prices even fell below those of diesel.



The supply glut may further worsen after Zhejiang Petrochemical starts to supply gasoline in the second half of this year.However, PetroChina's subsidiary refiners may be cautious in exporting gasoline, as export prices may be lower than their costs.PetroChina continued to subsidize diesel exports but changed the subsidy period from quarterly to monthly.By JLC InternationalMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Why Natural Gas Prices CollapsedIran’s Best Bet To Avoid U.S. SanctionsCan China’s Rare Earth Monopoly Be Broken?

Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers vetoed a provision in the state budget that would have allowed Tesla to sell its vehicles directly to consumers, in a third (failed) chance for the EV maker to have a direct-sales business model in the state of Wisconsin.Last week, the state legislators passed the budget plan, which the Governor had to sign into law this week. In order to secure the vote of Republican lawmaker Chris Kapenga who had reservations on earlier drafts of the state budget proposal, Republicans included in the last minute an amendment, the so-called ‘Tesla provision’, to allow the EV maker to sell its cars directly to consumers bypassing dealerships.Kapenga voted for the budget, which passed the Senate with 17 votes to 16. Kapenga owns a business that repairs Teslas, but has argued that it’s more like a hobby, and therefore not a conflict of interest. In his newsletter last week when the Senate passed the budget, Kapenga said:



“A free market reform that will help boost the state’s economy was also added at my request. This provision will allow Tesla to open stores and service centers in Wisconsin. Our state law, which originates back to the 1930’s, prevents them from doing business here. This forces customers to drive to Illinois or Minnesota just to purchase or service their vehicle. It’s a reform I have been pushing for a couple of years and was finally able to accomplish.”Related: Putin: Oil Price Volatility Is Hurting Russia's EconomyGovernor Tony Evers, a Democrat, vetoed 78 items upon signing the state budget, including the so-called ‘Tesla provision.’  Gov. Evers motivated his ‘Tesla veto’ with his objection to “significant changes to existing motor vehicle dealership law and the consumer protections they provide to Wisconsin occurring late in the state budget process and without the opportunity for adequate public input and debate.”



According to Electrek, Evers received US$14,000 during his campaign from the Wisconsin Automobile and Truck Dealer Association which was against the legislation.Meanwhile, despite reports that it won’t be able to meet Elon Musk’s goal for record production and sales for Q2, Tesla said earlier this week that it achieved record production of 87,048 vehicles and record deliveries of around 95,200 vehicles, beating analyst expectations, sending the stock rallying 7 percent on Tuesday, and giving Tesla bulls a new hope.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:US Oil And Gas M&A Remains LacklusterTrade Deal Could Send Oil To $75Is This A Turning Point In Libya’s Civil War?

Two of OPEC’s heavyweights, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, have recently made significant progress in their years-long talks about resolving a dispute over shared fields that can produce some 500,000 bpd, Bloomberg reported on Thursday, quoting people familiar with the issue.The Saudis and Kuwait made a breakthrough in talks in Riyadh last month about settling some sovereignty issues in the so-called Neutral Zone, which could lead to an agreement about restarting oil production from the area, Bloomberg’s sources said.The so-called Partitioned Neutral Zone (PNZ) was established between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait in 1922 to settle a territorial dispute between the two countries. As of 2015, the oil production capacity in the neutral zone stood at 600,000 bpd, equally divided between Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, according to the EIA. Production from the zone averaged around 500,000 bpd just before the shutdown of the two oil fields, Khafji and Wafra, in 2014-2015.



The two OPEC members are now drafting new documents preparing for a next meeting expected to be held in Kuwait as soon as this month, one of Bloomberg’s sources noted.Earlier this year, Saudi Arabia’s Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said thatSaudi Arabia expects that it could reach a deal with Kuwait to resume oil production from the Neutral Zone this year.



Even if the two sides reach an agreement on resuming production, it’s not clear how fast oil production could be restarted, how fast it could be ramped up, and how much the fields could collectively pump given the fact that it’s been five years since they were shut down.As much as 500,000 bpd of additional oil output from the Middle East could help ease supply concerns in view of declining production in Iran and Venezuela and fighting in Libya, on the one hand. But these 500,000 bpd could add to the global inventory overhang that OPEC continues to try to eliminate by extending the production cuts into 2020, if oil demand further weakens in the absence of a U.S.-China trade deal and slowing global economy, on the other hand.   By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Gibraltar Seizes Syria-Bound Oil Tanker Breaching SanctionsPutin: Oil Price Volatility Is Hurting Russia's EconomyThe Real Reason Why ExxonMobil Won’t Go Ahead With $53 Billion Iraqi Megaproject

The world needs to get to the point at which it will no longer add to the stock of greenhouse gases, and reducing emissions to net zero “is the only way to go,” Shell’s chief executive Ben van Beurden said in a speech at The Energy Summit near London, calling on businesses to work together to move faster in addressing climate change.While admitting that the world still needs oil, and will need it still for decades to come, van Beurden said that the supply and the demand side of the energy use should work together to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement to restrict the rise in global temperatures to well below 2 degrees Celsius.Shell itself aims to reduce the net carbon intensity of the energy products it sells by around 50 percent by 2050, the manager reminded his audience.  



Earlier this year Shell announced its first-ever short-term goals to cut the carbon footprint of its operations and product sales. In December last year, in an industry first, Shell said that it plans to set short-term targets for reducing the net carbon footprint of the energy products it sells, and to link those targets with executive remuneration. However, Shell’s core business is and will continue to be oil and gas for the foreseeable future, van Beurden said last fall.   Speaking today, Shell’s top executive said that the world would still need oil, for the foreseeable future.



“On the energy supply side, a company like Shell can mainly help by selling a mix of energy products with a lower carbon intensity. Oil, yes, the world needs it, and will need it for decades to come. But also, and increasingly, natural gas, renewable power, hydrogen, biofuels,” van Beurden said.“And while I do not stand here offering the answers on how to get there, I am determined to help find them. What I would like is for Shell to be a part, just a one part, of a much bigger global climate coalition of business. A coalition dedicated to Paris,” the manager said, noting that “if energy providers and energy users, supply and demand, do not take co-ordinated action I have no doubt time will run out.”By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Gibraltar Seizes Syria-Bound Oil Tanker Breaching SanctionsPutin: Oil Price Volatility Is Hurting Russia's EconomyThe Real Reason Why ExxonMobil Won’t Go Ahead With $53 Billion Iraqi Megaproject

China plans to launch a low-sulfur bunker fuel oil futures contract in a bid to raise its pricing power in the world’s maritime fuel oil market.The Shanghai Futures Exchange (ShFE) looks to launch the futures contract open to foreign investors and traders by the end of this year, Reuters quoted a statement from the Shanghai Futures Exchange as saying on Thursday.The shipping industry is preparing for a major disruption of the types of fuels it will be using as early as the beginning of 2020, when stricter regulations for the sulfur content of fuel come into force. According to the new rules by the International Maritime Organization (IMO), only 0.5-percent or lower sulfur fuel oil should be used on ships beginning January 1, 2020, unless said ships have installed the so-called scrubbers—systems that remove sulfur from exhaust gas emitted by bunkers.



As the starting date for the new low-sulfur rules approaches, China wants to gain more influence on the pricing of those fuels on the global market and become a key supply center of low-sulfur bunker fuel oil.“The contract will help expand China’s pricing influence in global bunker fuel oil market and help China to improve its maritime transportation capacity,” Jiang Yan, chairman of the Shanghai Futures Exchange, said in a statement, as carried by Reuters.Chinese companies are preparing to produce more low-sulfur fuel oil ahead of the 2020 shipping regulation change.



Last month, Sinopec said that it plans to have the capability to produce 10 million tons of low-sulfur marine fuel oil by 2020 and reach 15 million tons by 2023.The low-sulfur bunker fuel oil futures contract will be China’s second oil futures contract after the crude oil futures contract it launched in March 2018.More than a year after the launch, China’s yuan-denominated crude oil futures are still seen mainly as a Chinese market for Chinese traders who don’t trade on market fundamentals. The futures contract struggles to become truly international for market participants, while inconsistent trading volumes are not helping international traders to use the Shanghai futures as a financial hedge.  By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:OPEC’s Future Looks Bleak As It Extends DealPutin: Oil Price Volatility Is Hurting Russia's EconomyTrade Deal Could Send Oil To $75

The British Columbia Oil and Gas Commission has granted a permit for the Woodfibre LNG project, after it also received a license to export 2.1 million tons of LNG from the Canadian province for a period of 40 years.CBC reports the US$1.22-billion (C$1.6 billion) project has yet to get the final green light after an environmental impact assessment, and notes there is strong regional opposition to a new fossil fuel facility in the province that has recently become notorious for its government-driven opposition to the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project.While LNG and natural gas in its original form are a lot less polluting than crude oil, fossil fuel opponents tend to ignore that distinction when opposing new energy projects.



“We simply cannot develop new fossil fuel infrastructure if we want to have a livable planet. We’re facing a climate emergency and developing natural gas for export makes absolutely no sense,” one environmental activist from a local environmental organization in Squamish, where Woodfibre LNG will be located, told The Star.The Woodfibre LNG project, which will supply the commodity to Asian markets where demand for it is the strongest, has already gone through three environmental assessments but has yet to meet additional conditions in this respect, along with some archaeological and technical ones.However, unlike other energy infrastructure projects, Woodfibre LNG has also received the approval of the Squamish First Nation, whose council voted in favor of the facility after it agreed to a benefits agreement with the company behind the project. It would see the First Nation receive some US$172.2 million (C$225 million) over the life of the project.



Woodfibre LNG would be B.C.’s second LNG project, after the consortium behind the LNG Canada project made the final investment decision on it last year. LNG Canada is much bigger, however, with an initial capacity of 6.5 million tons, and the option to boost this to as much as 26 million tons.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Trade Deal Could Send Oil To $75Is This A Turning Point In Libya’s Civil War?Will OPEC Cuts Trigger New Wave Of US Shale Oil?

Cuban oil firm Cubametales has found itself on the receiving end of further US sanctions as the United States attempts to more completely restrict Venezuela oil exports in an effort to overthrow Maduro from the crisis-stricken country, according to a press release from the US Department of Treasury.The sanctions cover all property and interests in property of Cubametales.“The Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) designated Cubametales, the Cuban state-run oil import and export company, for its continued importation of oil from Venezuela,” the statement from the OFAC read, adding that Cuba took oil and in exchange offered to Venezuela support, “including defense, intelligence, and security assistance” to Maduro’s regime, which it referred to as the “illegitimate regime of former President Nicolas Maduro.”



This barter agreement between Venezuela and Cuba is a long-standing one dating back to 2000.Cubametales is responsible for 100 percent of oil imports and exports to and from Cuba.Today’s OFAC action also includes some delisting action of Italian Owned PB Tankers, who had been hit with an earlier round of sanctions for transporting oil from Venezuela in violation of the executive order signed by President Donald Trump. One of its tankers reportedly had delivered oil from Venezuela to Cuba in March. In response to those sanctions, PB Tankers ended its business with Cubametales. The steps it has taken caused the United States to unblock all its previously blocked assets and property.



The press release stressed the point that its sanctions need not be permanent.Communist Party leader Raul Castro said in April that Cuba would never abandon its Venezuelan ally, no matter what sanctions are levied upon it.Venezuela managed to increase its oil exports for June by 26 percent despite the sanctions, mostly to China, India, and Singapore.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Is This A Turning Point In Libya’s Civil War?Will OPEC Cuts Trigger New Wave Of US Shale Oil?Oil Markets Not Impressed By Small Crude Draw

Kazakhstan aims to significantly increase its crude oil exports to China by redirecting some oil flows from Europe to the world’s top oil importer, Kazakhstan’s Deputy Energy Minister Aset Magauov told Reuters in an interview published on Wednesday.The Central Asian country, which is part of the non-OPEC group of oil producers in the OPEC+ production cut deal, plans to reverse its Kenkiyak-Atyrau oil pipeline for crude flows to the east from the current westward oil flow direction, the official told Reuters.Kazakhstan will be aiming to increase its crude oil exports to China to 6-7 million tons annually, up from just 1 million tons currently.



Kazakhstan’s oil exports to the Chinese market slumped from a peak of 11.3 million tons in 2013 to just 1.3 million tons in 2018. According to Magauov, the plunge in exports to China has been mostly due to natural declines of oil fields in southern and northwest Kazakhstan, many of which are operated by Chinese oil companies.Kazakhstan will now aim to reverse the decline in its Chinese exports by using the Kenkiyak-Atyrau in the eastern direction, thus linking more fields in western Kazakhstan to domestic refineries, freeing up volumes of oil for exports to the east.More oil for exports to China would likely come from small fields, rather than from the giant Kashagan oil field, or the Tengiz and Karachaganak oilfields, because the western oil majors running those huge fields are not eager to sell in China as they are not particularly happy with the Chinese pricing formulas, Magauov told Reuters.



Kazakhstan—part of the non-OPEC group that have joined OPEC’s efforts to rebalance the oil market and prop up oil prices—has pledged to cut 40,000 bpd of its production and keep it at 1.86 million bpd between January and June. Kazakhstan, like all countries the OPEC+ pact, pledged this week to keep those cuts through the end of March 2020.According to Kazakhstan’s energy ministry data, the country’s oil production averaged 1.79 million bpd in the first half of 2019, meaning, the ministry says, that Kazakhstan overcomplied with the cuts by reducing production by 70,000 bpd from its November 2018 level.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:China Raises Crude Import Quotas Amid Falling Refining MarginsIs This The Beginning Of The End For OPEC?European Gas Prices Fall To One-Decade Low

Now that Guyana is the new offshore oil hotspot, the South American country is getting ready to lift the government royalties for new oil contracts, after earlier deals had offered handsome shares for the foreign firms that ventured into Guyana’s waters.  Guyana will have to review all royalties for future oil contracts, Mark Bynoe, director at Guyana’s Department of Energy, told Reuters on Wednesday.“We expect them to be higher than they currently are,” Bynoe said on the sidelines of an energy conference in London.



The country aims to hold a new licensing round next year and expects the new licenses that will be awarded to be under the new royalty terms, according to the Guyanese official, who said that the new oil royalty regime would not affect existing contracts.Last year, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) was said to have recommended that Guyana’s authorities raise the royalty rates for future oil contracts.As far as existing contracts are concerned, Guyana is in the early stages of a probe into how oil exploration rights were awarded for oil blocks that are currently controlled by ExxonMobil and Tullow Oil, Clive Thomas, director of Guyana’s State Assets Recovery Agency, told Bloomberg in an interview in May.Related: Saudis May Cut Oil Prices For Asian Markets



The little known South American country bordering Venezuela ad Brazil has become one of the world’s top hotspots for oil offshore operators in just a few years. Some critics of the way Guyana handled the oil block leases, such as the president’s former energy adviser Jan Mangal, argue that Guyana sold off its oil riches too cheaply. A curious fact was also the timing of a lease for the Kaieteur block to Exxon in the final days of the previous administration in 2015—the awarding of the block took place just nine days before Exxon announced its first (of now more than a dozen) discoveries offshore Guyana.In May 2019, Exxon gave the green light to the development of Liza Phase 2 offshore Guyana after it received government and regulatory approvals. Phase 2 is expected to begin producing up to 220,000 bpd in mid-2022, while Phase 1 is on schedule for first oil by the first quarter of 2020, with up to 120,000 bpd of production.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Is This The Beginning Of The End For OPEC?China Raises Crude Import Quotas Amid Falling Refining MarginsPemex Pursues Deepwater Oil Despite Pledges To Play It Safe

Mexico’s state oil firm Pemex plans to pursue an ultra-deepwater project in the Gulf of Mexico despite limited resources and despite recent pledges to avoid riskier endeavors in which it lacks experience.Mexico’s energy regulator, the National Hydrocarbons Commission CNH, has recently approved a plan by Pemex to drill for oil in ultra deep waters in the Gulf of Mexico, Reuters reported on Wednesday, quoting a filing with CNH.Just two weeks ago, Pemex’s chief financial officer Alberto Velazquez said that the state oil firm would avoid investing in deepwater projects, instead focusing on areas where it has experience, including the shallow waters of the Gulf of Mexico and onshore fields.



Yet, according to the drilling and exploration plan approved by CNH, Pemex plans to invest US$106 million in four years exploring in the Perdido area, which is a prolific producing basin on the U.S. side of the maritime border. Actual drilling is set for Q2 2021, according to the plan seen by Reuters.Even if Pemex were to find oil in its deepwater drilling project, it would certainly need an experienced external partner to help with the complexities of deepwater development, CNH commissioner Alma American Porres told Reuters.However, CNH canceled an auction last month to pick foreign partners for Pemex scheduled for October as the populist left-wing Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador is seeking a greater role for Pemex in reversing the downward trend in Mexican oil production.



López Obrador is criticizing the energy reform of his predecessor Enrique Peña Nieto—who opened in 2013 Mexico’s oil and gas sector to private investment for the first time in seven decades—and the foreign oil firms for failing to do so.  Yet, analysts and credit rating agencies doubt that Mexico will succeed reversing its oil production decline by entrusting this effort to the most indebted oil company in the world, which the government continues to support with tax rate cuts and tax breaks, but which weighs on the government’s finances because of its deteriorating credit profile.   By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Oil Markets Not Impressed By Small Crude DrawForeign Investors Can Now Get In On China’s Energy BoomAnother Beneficiary Of The OPEC Deal Emerges

China’s Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) has issued this year’s second-batch quotas for non-state crude imports, permitting 56.85 million mt of import, according to a notice from the MOFCOM.The quotas surged 377% from 11.91 million mt for the same batch in 2018.The MOFCOM has thus released permits for a total of 153.10 million mt of non-state crude import so far this year, including the supplementary quotas for 4.31 million mt of import for the first batch, a modest increase of 1.21% from the total quotas for 2018.



Hengli Petrochemical obtained permits for 12.80 million mt of crude import under the second-batch quotas, while Zhejiang Petrochemical was not listed. Hengli is raising its refinery operating rate and its monthly crude import has exceeded one million mt, industry sources said. Zhejiang Petrochemical has started up only one 200,000 bbl/day crude distillation unit and has not achieved a full production line yet, but it is still possible for the MOFCOM to grant permits to Zhejiang Petrochemical later this year.Conventional independent refiners (excluding ChemChina’s subsidiaries, Fuhaichuang Petrochemical/Dragon Aromatics (Zhangzhou) and new refining-chemical complexes) have got quotas for 100.31 million mt of non-state crude import under the two batches of quotas for 2019, a drop of 3.18 million mt or 3.07% year on year, JLC data shows. Meanwhile, the quotas for ChemChina shrank by nearly 20% to 14.82 million mt. All this indicates increasing negative impacts on conventional private refiners as new refining-chemical projects come on stream, and the government’s policy preference for traditional refiners has come to an end.Traditional independent refiners have recorded low operating rates and shrinking refining margins year-to-date, and new refiners such as Hengli and Zhejiang Petrochemical will make major inroads into these traditional refiners’ markets. As the market becomes increasingly oversupplied, traditional refiners are in great need of upgrades, and only some of them will survive in the future.



As more refiners eye a larger role in the petrochemical sector and more related government policies come out, the country will see increasing integration of independent refiners, more relocation to industrial parks, more extensions to the chemical sector and increasing refining capacity for a single refinery.By JLC InternationalMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:The Success Story Behind Tesla’s Tarnished ImagePompeo Makes Hard Claim: Strait Of Hormuz Will Remain OpenClimate Change Could Trigger Global Financial Crisis

The Conservative Alberta government will provide natural gas producers in the province with a one-off 35-percent tax cut on shallow gas well and pipeline operators for the current fiscal year, Alberta media report, citing a “broken” assessment system.“We looked at the situation and said that everyone agrees that the assessment system is inaccurate and so we’re going to act now to bring that down to what we think the true level should be and then we’ll commit to a proper full review of that system for the next municipal tax year,” an unnamed government official said as quoted by the Calgary Herald.The problem with the assessment system, according to the government, is that it overvalues natural gas assets, the same official said, adding that 35 percent was approximately the extent of the overvaluing.



Alberta’s natural gas industry, though overshadowed by the oil sands’ pipeline woes, has been suffering its own blows, including low gas prices and high lease and property taxes. There have been numerous bankruptcies in the industry in the last few years. The latest was Trident Exploration Corp. which threw in the towel in May, abandoning as many as 4,700 wells.Also in May the industry suffered a hard price blow when TC Energy—formerly TransCanada—began maintenance on the Nova pipeline system. From US$1.30 (C$1.70) per thousand cu ft, gas prices dropped to just US$0.22 (C$0.28) within a single week.In a bid to help pro up the industry, the Conservative government also appointed an Associate Minister of Natural Gas—a first for the province—to focus specifically on the natural gas industry, which, thanks to growing demand for LNG, could have a substantial growth potential.



“They absolutely have felt like the second cousins to Big Oil. And here’s the reality, if we can get natural gas to global markets, it’s a game changer for Alberta,” said Dale Nally, the natural gas associate minister.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Oil Markets Not Impressed By Small Crude DrawIs This The Beginning Of The End For OPEC?''Maximum Pressure'' Campaign Fails To Kill Off Iran's Oil Exports

Occidental Petroleum has called on its shareholders to vote against activist investor Carl Icahn’s push to replace four members of the board of directors in a bid to prevent future deals of the magnitude of the Anadarko takeover.Reuters reports that the billionaire investor’s plans include changing the company’s charter to stop it from ever taking over another company like Anadarko again.Carl Icahn was among the most vocal critics of the US$38-billion takeover of Anadarko, in which Occidental beat Chevron. The deal will cement and expand Occidental’s position as the largest oil producer in the Permian after it incorporates Anadarko’s acreage, which comes in at some 600,000 acres gross in the Delaware Basin, part of the largest and most prolific shale play in the United States.



The takeover was the result of a bidding war in which Occidental first beat Chevron’s US$33-billion offer and then tweaked its own so that the cash portion of the price ended up at 80 percent. Icahn has argued that this is too high a price for such a deal, adding that it could jeopardize the future of Occidental in case oil prices fall substantially.“It is important to add new directors to Occidental’s Board of Directors to oversee future extraordinary transactions like the Anadarko transaction and to ensure that they are not consummated without stockholder approval when appropriate,” he told Oxy shareholders last month.Icahn’s concern about unfavorable oil prices is not out of the question: despite OPEC+’s decision to extend cuts totaling 1.2 million bpd until the end of March 2020, oil prices have been on the decline pressured by rising U.S. production and worry that the U.S.-China trade war and other factors would lead to slower global economic growth and affect oil demand.



Even with these worries, however, Occidental is better placed than many to weather lower oil prices simply because of its size and footprint in the Permian.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Chinese Scientists Find New Way To Clean Up Oil SpillsOPEC+ Fails To Reassure The Oil MarketOPEC’s Future Looks Bleak As It Extends Deal

The American Petroleum Institute (API) reported another large crude oil inventory draw of 5 million barrels for the week ending June 27, a more ambitious draw than analysts had predicted, at 2.484-million barrels.Last week, the API reported a draw of 7.55-million barrels. A day later, the EIA estimated that US inventories had drawn down by a much larger 12.8 million barrels.The net build is 21.69 million barrels for the 27-week reporting period so far this year, using API data.


Oil prices were trading down significantly on Tuesday despite OPEC’s success at pulling a deal together to extend the production cuts into 2020. The hard-fought battle won, OPEC was unable to offset the dampened mood brought on by grim oil demand prospects and an unsettled US-China trade row.  At 12:56pm EST, WTI was trading down by $1.92 (-3.25%) at $57.17—just $1.00 over last week’s levels. Brent was trading down $1.69 (-2.60%) at $63.37—also up roughly $1 over this time last weekThe API this week reported a 387,000-barrel draw in gasoline inventories for week ending June 27. Analysts estimated a larger draw in gasoline inventories of 2.175-million barrels for the week.Distillate inventories fell by 1.7 million barrels for the week, while inventories at Cushing rose by 882,000 million barrels.



US crude oil production as estimated by the Energy Information Administration showed that production for the week ending June 21 fell again this week to 12.1 million bpd, the third such drop in as many weeks, and 300,000 bpd off the all-time high.The U.S. Energy Information Administration report on crude oil inventories is due to be released on Wednesday at 10:30a.m. EST.By 4:41pm EST, WTI had fallen nearly 5% on the day to $56.29 while Brent traded at $62.59.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:The Libya Conflict Just Took A Very Dangerous TurnThese 12 U.S. States Just Hiked Gasoline TaxesBP’s Highly Unusual Natural Gas Investment

The booming liquefied natural gas (LNG) infrastructure around the world—with the U.S. and Canada accounting for 74 percent of proposed LNG export terminal capacity—poses “a direct challenge to Paris climate goals,” a new report from Global Energy Monitor has found. The push for LNG has sparked outrage by renewables activists who liken the so-called bridge fuel to kicking an oxycontin habit in favor of heroin.Global Energy Monitor, a network of researchers developing collaborative informational resources on fossil fuels and alternatives, argues that the massive increase in LNG-related infrastructure globally is incompatible with the warning of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) that gas use must drop by 15 percent by 2030 and 43 percent by 2050 compared to 2020, if the planet is to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.“With the move to natural gas, it’s as if we proudly announced we kicked our Oxycotin habit by taking up heroin instead,” Global Energy Monitor’s report said, quoting environmentalist Bill McKibben.



According to the report, the main component in natural gas—methane—has been responsible for 25 percent of global warming to date.“Measured by global warming impacts, the scale of the LNG expansion under development is as large or greater than the expansion of coal-fired power plants, posing a direct challenge to Paris climate goals,” the report from Global Energy Monitor highlights.Globally, a total of US$1.3 trillion—including US$507 billion in the United States and US$410 billion in Canada—is currently being invested in LNG expansion, which would lock in much higher levels of natural gas production through the middle of this century.Related: Putin Undermines OPEC’s Power



Not only will increased use of natural gas undermine climate goals, but the “falling cost of renewable alternatives will make many of these projects unprofitable in the long term and put much of the $1.3 trillion being invested in this global gas expansion at risk,” Global Energy Monitor said.Many companies are pitching LNG and natural gas as a cleaner burning fossil fuel than coal, but Global Energy Monitor disagrees because comparisons don’t take into account the effect of leakages in natural gas production and transportation because methane “is a far more powerful global warming gas than carbon dioxide.”“Even today, there’s still talk of natural gas a bridge towards renewables, which is completely contrary to the facts,” Ted Nace, executive director of the Global Energy Monitor, told The Canadian Press.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:OPEC’s Future Looks Bleak As It Extends DealThese 12 U.S. States Just Hiked Gasoline TaxesMassive Oil Worker Brawl in Kazakhstan Leaves 30 Wounded, 150 Stranded

Venezuela exported 1.1 million bpd of crude oil and refined oil products in June, up by 26 percent from May, thanks to higher shipments under oil-for-loan deals with China, Reuters reported on Tuesday, citing Refinitiv Eikon data and company records of Venezuela’s state oil firm PDVSA.According to the oil company’s documents, China accounted for 59 percent of Venezuela’s oil shipments last month, with India and Singapore a distant second and third, with 18 percent and 10 percent of Venezuela’s oil exports, respectively.In May, Venezuela’s oil exports had slumped by 17 percent on the month to 874,500 bpd as the country had shut down almost all of its upgraders.



Venezuela had to seriously reshuffle its crude oil and oil products export destinations earlier this year after the U.S. essentially prohibited Venezuelan oil imports to America.The United States imposed sweeping sanctions on Venezuela’s oil industry and PDVSA at the end of January to cut off a cash lifeline for Nicolas Maduro and his regime, after Washington recognized opposition leader Juan Guaidó as the legitimate interim president of the Latin American country sitting on the world’s largest crude oil reserves.Unable to export its crude oil to the United States—which didn’t import any crude oil from Venezuela in the week to March 15 for the first time ever since the EIA began tracking weekly U.S. crude oil imports—Venezuela is now prioritizing shipments to Asia, especially to China, with which it has struck oil-for-loan agreements and has to repay those with oil to China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC).



While Venezuela’s oil exports to China averaged 233,000 bpd in February immediately after the U.S. sanctions cut off Venezuelan oil from the U.S. market, those exports nearly tripled to 656,000 bpd in June, according to the data. The U.S. didn’t import any crude oil from Venezuela last month, according to the data that Reuters has compiled.

The world’s fourth-largest oilfield services provider, Weatherford International, said that it had started a financial restructuring by filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the U.S. in a bid to reduce its long-term debt of more than US$7 billion.Weatherford also expects to file for bankruptcy protection in Ireland and Bermuda in the coming months.“The comprehensive financial restructuring would significantly reduce the Company's long-term debt and related interest costs, provide access to additional financing and establish a more sustainable capital structure,” Weatherford said in a statement this week, following up on a press release from May that it had reached a deal with senior note holders about a financial restructuring aimed at significantly reducing long-term debt. The company expected the restructuring agreement to be implemented under a ‘pre-packaged’ Chapter 11 process that would reduce its long-term debt by more than US$5.8 billion.



On May 13, the New York Stock Exchange NYSE suspended trading in Weatherford’s ordinary shares and said it intends to begin proceedings to delist the shares because they are no longer suitable for listing due to “abnormally low” price levels. Weatherford said at the time that it planned to appeal that decision.The financial struggles of one of the top drilling and well-completion services providers in the world after Schlumberger, Halliburton, and Baker Hughes, come at a time when U.S. shale production is booming and the Permian continues to set new production records.The shale production boom, however, hasn’t been so kind to all players in the U.S. oil patch.

China is allowing additional crude oil import quotas to predominantly private oil refiners in the world’s top oil importer, Reuters reported on Tuesday, citing a document it has seen.    The additional quotas for 33 private refiners and 10 government or province-run refiners allow those 43 refineries to import an additional 56.85 million tons of crude oil for the rest of this year, bringing the total volume of allowed import quotas issued this year to 151 million tons, equivalent to 3.02 million barrels per day (bpd), according to Reuters calculations.The biggest winner in the new import quotas was private chemical and refinery giant Hengli Petrochemical, which had a new refinery start up earlier this year.



The total 3 million bpd of import quotas for this year equals one third of total Chinese crude oil imports so far in 2019—at around 9.91 million bpd between January and May, according to Reuters estimates.Independent refiners, also referred to as ‘teapots’, have been instrumental in China’s oil demand jump over the last four years, driving up global demand as well and directing oil price predictions from analysts and the oil industry.The first batch of the import quotas for 2019 that China issued in January this year was for 20 percent lower volumes compared to the first batch of quotas last year, but analysts expected volumes to be higher in the following batches.



Last month, China agreed to grant crude oil import licenses to four independent refiners. This was the first round of import license awards for independent refiners since May last year, when Beijing granted licenses to a dozen teapots.Meanwhile, Beijing has been awarding oil product export quotas—and higher ones; since the start of the year, the quotas have exceeded 50 million tons of oil products. That’s despite an oversupply on the domestic market that has begun seeping into neighboring markets, pushing refiners’ margins lower.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:OPEC’s Future Looks Bleak As It Extends DealThese 12 U.S. States Just Hiked Gasoline TaxesOPEC And Partners Officially Ratify New Deal

Saudi Arabia may reduce its official selling price for oil for Asian buyers in August, unnamed sources told Reuters, adding the move was prompted by a decline in Middle Eastern benchmarks last month.A Reuters survey among five refiners revealed the official selling price for the Kingdom’s flagship Arab Light hit a five-year high for deliveries this month, but as benchmarks weaken OSPs have to come down, too. The cut could be of between US$0.30-0.50 per barrel.“The (official selling) prices need to come down because (spot) prices could drop further next month,” one refiner told Reuters, adding the Dubai benchmark used in pricing cargoes for September loading had fallen since that five-year peak last month.



Saudi Arabia earlier this year increased its OSPs for Asian clients after the U.S. ended the sanction waivers granted to eight Iranian oil importers. Out of options, many refiners in the region were forced to place additional orders for Saudi crude to fill the gap.However, it was quickly clear this can’t be a long-term strategy as Asian buyers, and particularly China and India, would soon begin to look for cheaper alternatives if Saudi prices remain high. What’s more, benchmarks have proved stubborn in their reluctance to continue climbing up: after a brief spike by about US$2 per barrel on the largely expected news OPEC+ will extend its production cuts, Brent and WTI both retreated.In addition to the already chronic effect of U.S. production updates on prices, worry about global oil demand is returning, too, and it wiped out a lot of the gains oil had registered yesterday.



“After 2-1/2 years of production cuts, the effects of rolling over production cuts is losing steam,” an analyst from OANDA told Reuters. “The trade war is not likely to get resolved any time soon,” Edward Moya said, “and while central banks globally are expected to deliver fresh stimulus in the coming months, economic activity is continuing to trend lower.”By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:The Last Truly Underdeveloped Oil Frontier In The Middle EastOPEC’s Future Looks Bleak As It Extends DealOPEC And Partners Officially Ratify New Deal

A report that Occidental Petroleum’s corporate jet traveled to the Hague, one of Shell’s two home towns, has sparked a fresh flare-up of speculation regarding its proposed acquisition of Anadarko, CNBC reports, citing an unnamed source.CNBC notes that sightings of Oxy’s Gulfstream V in Omaha gave rise to rumors about a possible involvement of Warren Buffett in the deal, which later got their confirmation when Buffett said he was willing to bankroll the Anadarko acquisition if Occidental managed to get a final yes from the target company. The Sage from Omaha has committed US$10 billion to the deal, which is worth a total US$38 billion.



The trip of Oxy’s corporate jet was first reported by Bloomberg, which has evidently been tracking the movements of the aircraft amid the bidding war between Oxy and Chevron, which last month offered to buy Anadarko for US$33 billion. Earlier this month, Bloomberg said the Gulfstream V had flown to Paris, where Total is headquartered.Shell and Anadarko, CNBC recalls, have shared assets in the Permian, where Occidental is the top player and Anadarko is among the largest competitors. The acquisition of the latter will establish Occidental as an undisputed leader in a space that supermajors have been eager to tap as well, with all but one expanding their assets there and planning ambitious drilling campaigns. The lone exception is Total, which has no shale acreage at all in the United States, which would make the Oxy jet’s trip to Paris all the more intriguing if, of course, it was made with the intention of meeting with Total at all.



The latest update in the bidding war between occidental and Chevron was in favor of Oxy: Anadarko’s board of directors said its offer was “superior” after the bidder raised the portion of cash in its offer to as much as 80 percent from an initial 25 percent that was later raised to 50 percent.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:OPEC’s Future Looks Bleak As It Extends DealWhy The Clean Energy Revolution Isn’t Taking Off In RussiaThe Last Truly Underdeveloped Oil Frontier In The Middle East

The Governor of Montana, Steve Bullock, has broken away from the Democrat’s strong pro-climate change stance and threw his support behind the controversial Keystone XL pipeline, according to the Associated Press, with the caveat that it needed to be done right.Bullock is one of many in an overcrowded Democrats throwing his hat in the ring for President of the United States in 2020.Bullock reached out directly to millennials using Facebook to hold a town hall discussion about climate change, and specifically on how to reduce emissions in Montana. The governor appeared taken aback by the question as to where Keystone XL fits into this plan, but noted that it is far riskier to haul the oil over land.



Bullock also announced today that North Dakota would join the climate change council—the council developed for individual states to address the effects of climate change—after the federal government pulled out of the Paris Climate Deal, fulfilling one of President Donald Trump’s campaign promises.Bullock has a spotty climate record among fellow democrats, and likely will get pursed lips from some of the more progressive members of the party, such as AOC who has an all-in climate stance. Bullock’s stance on the climate consists of lukewarm support for the Obama-era Clean Power Plan, and vehement support for solar energy that calls for a 400 percent increase, and 200 percent increase for wind power. To do this, Bullock would re-enter the Paris Climate agreement.A Montana court lifted in early June the injunction that halted construction on the Keystone XL pipeline that would move 830,000 barrels of crude oil daily from Canada to the United States. But the delays on the pipeline thus far, already have made it impossible to begin work in 2019

Work at an oil construction site managed by the giant Chevron-Exxon JV for the Tengiz oilfield has been suspended amid a massive brawl over a woman that’s left some 150 Indian nationals stranded and 30 Jordanian and Lebanese oil workers injured as diplomats from various countries have been called in. The brawl at the 3GP oil construction site began over the weekend after a picture of a female Kazakh oil worker was shared on social media. According to local media, a Libyan employee published a photo with a Kazakh co-worker in a jokingly suggestive pose, angering the community and Kazakh workers. The photo, circulated on a messaging app, infuriated workers who went on a rampage, attacking anyone of Arab origin. 



The footage of the incident uploaded to the internet showed Kazakh’s brutally beating their co-workers, many portrayed covered in blood and badly bruised. The assaulted are mostly Jordanians, according to reports. The author of the controversial picture, Libyan national Eli Daoud, identified as the chief administrator for logistics, later posted a video apologizing for the photo. The work site is managed by Tengizchevroil (TCO), a joint venture of Chevron and ExxonMobil, and security forces are now on the scene.  Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri has ordered officials to monitor the case, while Jordan’s Crown Prince Hussein has directed his Cabinet to do the same. India’s Mission in Kazakhstan tweeted an emergency number to help the stranded Indians, whose role in the incident remains unclear.  Related: Are Asian LNG Prices About To Rally?Radio Free Europe reported that some 150 citizens of Lebanon were evacuated from the oilfield under police protection. 



Local authorities in Kazakhstan’s Atyrau region are attempting to use the incident to gain political capital, with Governor Nurlan Nogayev telling the Tengizchevroil management that the brawl occurred due to disparity in living conditions between foreign contractors and local Kazakh employees, with locals being disadvantaged. Nogayev suggested that while the photograph may have been the trigger, the real cause runs far deeper. Almost two years ago, a brawl erupted between some 700 Kazakh and Indian construction workers in the Kazakh capital, with fighting leading to road closures and the expelling of 60 Indian nationals from the country. By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:The Libya Conflict Just Took A Very Dangerous TurnThese 12 U.S. States Just Hiked Gasoline TaxesBP’s Highly Unusual Natural Gas Investment

Russia’s oil production in June was 50,000 bpd below the level Moscow had pledged under the OPEC and non-OPEC production cut agreement, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said on Monday, as carried by Russian news agency Interfax.  As part of the OPEC+ production cuts between January and June, Russia is taking the lion’s share of the non-OPEC cuts and pledged to reduce production by 230,000 bpd from October’s post-Soviet record level of 11.421 million bpd, to 11.191 million bpd.According to Novak, Russia’s production in June was 278,000 bpd lower than the reference level in October, or 50,000 bpd below its quota. 



Russia’s oil production in May was 11.15 million bpd, industry sources told Reuters earlier. This 11.15 million bpd level—a calculated figure using a tonnes to barrels conversion—is below Russia’s commitment under the OPEC+ deal. For June, Russia’s oil production is estimated at 11.13 million bpd.The current deal between OPEC and its Russia-led non-OPEC partners expired on June 30 and the partners are meeting in Vienna on Monday and Tuesday to discuss the fate of the agreement. OPEC and allies are signaling that a nine-month extension of the cuts at their current levels is almost a foregone conclusion.  Russia finally complied with its share of the production cuts as part of the OPEC+ deal, but not by choice. Russia’s oil production continued to trend lower in May as exports via the Druzhba oil pipeline were restricted due to a contamination issue, helping Russia to finally fall in line with the oil production cuts.



Russia’s oil production averaged 11.126 million bpd between May 1 and 26, two industry sources told Reuters. This compares to average production of 11.147 million bpd between May 1 and 21.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:OPEC’s Future Looks Bleak As It Extends DealAre Asian LNG Prices About To Rally?Why The Clean Energy Revolution Isn’t Taking Off In Russia

French consumer fraud watchdog DGCCRF has searched the offices of energy companies, including those of giants Eni and Engie, as part of an anti-competition probe into France’s retail electricity and gas market, Reuters reported on Monday.DGCCRF said in a statement today that 73 of its agents had carried out on June 27 simultaneous raids at the premises of 13 companies, two energy firms and 11 subcontracting companies, without revealing the name of any of the companies involved.France’s Engie confirmed that it was under investigation by the DGCCRF watchdog, a unit of the French finance ministry, and would fully cooperate, while Eni told Reuters that it had no immediate comment on the issue.



The DGCCRF consumer fraud regulator said that it had been receiving for months complaints from customers that energy firms were using misleading practices in signing up customers and persuading them to switch their supplier without their explicit informed agreement.The goal of the searches carried out last week is to determine whether these reported practices are isolated occurrences or a deliberate anti-competitive practice of energy suppliers, the DGCCRF said in its statement.If such practices are found and proved, they would be an offense of misleading commercial practices, punishable by French law with a penalty of up to 10 percent of a company’s annual revenue, the watchdog said.Related: U.S. Accounts For 98% Of All Global Oil Production Growth



According to Reuters, France’s state-controlled electricity firm EDF is losing retail customers to competitors and has complained about unfair practices used by its rivals to make them switch suppliers.The French electricity and natural gas markets were fully liberalized and opened to competition on July 1, 2007. Since then, consumers in France have been free to choose their retail energy provider, EDF or suppliers other than the state-controlled company known as “alternative” suppliers. Consumers can choose between two types of offers—prices set freely by suppliers, or regulated sale tariff set by the French government and proposed by EDF and local distribution companies. As of June 30, 2018, a total of 78 percent of residential and non-residential sites were paying the regulated tariff, and 22 percent were paying market rates, according to the French Energy Regulatory Commission.

Saudi Arabia is trying to boost security measures in place for its oil infrastructure and in territorial waters, Russian media quoted Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih as saying on Monday, after two apparent attacks on oil tankers in the Middle East in two months.Countries that get their crude oil via the shipping routes in the Middle East should protect their own ships along the lanes, U.S. President Donald Trump said last week, as tensions between the United States and Iran continue to simmer.Last month, two oil tankers—one owned by a Japanese firm and the other by a Norwegian company—were attacked in the Gulf of Oman, just outside the Strait of Hormuz, which connects the Persian Gulf with the Gulf of Oman and the open seas. The daily flows of oil through the Strait of Hormuz account for around 30 percent of all seaborne-traded crude oil and other liquids. 



The escalation of tension followed incidents in May with four oil tankers attacked near the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and a drone attack on a key onshore oil pipeline in Saudi Arabia. While Iran vehemently denies involvement in the attacks on the two oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman, the U.S. is blaming the Islamic Republic of being behind the attacks.U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said that the Strait of Hormuz will remain open for all vessels.



Days later, Iran shot down a U.S. drone over the Strait of Hormuz, claiming it had violated Iran’s air space. The U.S. says that the drone was in international air space.The U.S. had apparently prepared a response to the attacks with planned hits on Iranian targets, before President Trump stopped a planned strike 10 minutes before it was due to begin, because, he said, they were “not proportionate to shooting down an unmanned drone.”  By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:The Dark Outlook For Non-OPEC OilAn Offshore ""Scavenger"" Too Enticing To IgnoreMini-Grid Revolution Could Soon Power 490 Million People

Iran has just breached the 2015 nuclear deal by exceeding the limit for stockpiling enriched uranium, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said on Monday, confirming Iranian claims that it had violated the nuclear deal.“We can confirm that IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano has informed the Board of Governors that the Agency verified on 1 July that Iran’s total enriched uranium stockpile exceeded [the deal’s limit],” a spokesman for the IAEA said in a statement on Monday, as carried by Reuters.Earlier today, Iranian media quoted Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif as saying that Iran had exceeded the 300-kilogram limit for its stockpile of 3.67-percent enriched uranium because of Europe’s inaction to guarantee Iranian oil sales despite the U.S. sanctions. Iran will continue to lessen compliance with the nuclear deal if “the Europeans fail to meet the country's demands,” Iran’s Fars news agency quoted Zarif as saying.



“As far as I know, Iran has exceeded the 300kg limit according to the timeline and we had also earlier announced this issue and clearly stated which measures we will adopt as our rights based on the nuclear deal,” Zarif said on Monday.  In May, exactly a year after the United States withdrew from Iran nuclear deal, the Islamic Republic said that it is suspending some of its commitments under the agreement and threatened to resume enriching uranium at a higher level if the remaining signatories to the deal—the EU, Russia, and China—don’t fulfill within 60 days their commitments to Iran, including protecting the Iranian oil trade from U.S. sanctions.Iran started to announce measures for reduced compliance under the nuclear deal in “counteractions” against the maximum pressure campaign of the United States, which ended all waivers for Iranian oil customers and sent a carrier strike group to the Middle East as a warning to Iran.

The United Arab Emirates have launched the largest single solar power farm in the world, the 1.18-GW Noor Abu Dhabi, Endgadget reports citing a tweet by the Abu Dhabi government.The facility, which dwarfs the largest solar farm in the United States—the 569-MW Solar Star—is only comparable to solar parks, which combine several separate solar farms. It can supply electricity to 90,000 people, according to official information, from as many as 3.2 million solar panels. As a result, it would offset emissions amounting to 1 million metric tons, which is the equivalent of removing 200,000 cars from the road.



True to its reputation as being a large spender on various cutting-edge projects, the UAE is not stopping at Noor Abu Dhabi. Earlier this year, the Abu Dhabi Minister of Climate Change and Environment announced another, bigger, solar project. It would have a capacity of 2 GW, the official said without going into any further detail. The only project that would be bigger than this one, is Saudi Arabia’s 2.6-GW planned facility in Mecca.While the Middle East is hardly the first location that springs to mind when one thinks about solar power and other renewable energy sources, the region has been changing, slowly but surely. The International Renewable Energy Agency released a report in February saying the members of the Gulf Cooperation Council alone had plans to install as much as 7 GW in renewable power generation capacity by the early 2020s.



An earlier report from IRENA said GCC could save some 354 million barrels of oil equivalent by switching to renewables for domestic consumption by 2030. That would constitute a 23-percent decline in domestic oil and gas consumption with more of the commodities going for exports: Saudi Arabia is pursuing this strategy of reducing domestic consumption of fossil fuels with a view to boosting exports.Among the members of the GCC, the UAE is by far the best performer: it is home to almost 79 percent of the total installed solar capacity in the group. It even boasts renewable energy projects that do not require subsidies to be competitive.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:The Top 50 Oil & Gas Companies Of 2019The Dark Outlook For Non-OPEC OilU.S. Accounts For 98% Of All Global Oil Production Growth

Mexico’s billion-dollar oil hedge to protect next year’s revenues against oil price volatility will soon be made official, a finance ministry official said on Friday, according to Reuters, kicking off another year of trying to guess where oil prices are headed in 2020.The oil market is a volatile one, but Mexico’s track record for profiting from its Hacienda hedge is thought to be better than most. Under this hedging program, Mexico buys put options from Wall Street investment banks to sell hundreds of millions of barrels of oil. With these put options, Mexico is granted the right—but not the obligation—to sell its oil at a predetermined price for the upcoming year.



Last year, Mexico spent $1.23 billion to protect its 2019 revenues, locking in a fixed price of $55 per barrel. In 2015 and 2016 when oil prices tanked, Mexico did well, profiting billions of dollars from oil sales that it would otherwise not have received by negotiating up front pricing that turned out to be significantly higher than the actual market price. Mexico keeps the details of its oil hedge a complete mystery, maximizing its leverage in order to maximize these profits.The investment banks that get a piece of the action likely do a lot of handwringing in breathless anticipation of a deal with such an enormous scale. These investment banks have included the likes of Citi, JPMorgan, and Goldman Sachs, and in more recent years, Shell and BP have participated in the hedge too, in a chess game that pits Mexico against Big Oil to see who will come out on top.

Exxon and Shell could return to Somalia ahead of an oil bid round that the East African country plans to hold later in 2019, Reuters reported on Friday, citing a statement from Somalia’s oil ministry.  Shell and Exxon, which had a joint venture to explore five blocks offshore Somalia, stopped exploration and development in 1990 under force majeure because of the protracted hostilities in the country.The two oil supermajors have accrued rentals to the government since then, Shell told Reuters in a statement, while the Somali oil ministry said on Friday that an agreement was signed on June 21 in Amsterdam, settling the issues with the rentals and other obligations on offshore blocks accrued.Exxon and Shell have agreed to hold talks with Somalia’s government to convert their decades-old contracts in line with the new petroleum law that Somalia passed in May.



Yet, despite these developments, the force majeure remains in place, Shell told Reuters.Last month, Somalia passed its new Petroleum Law, hoping that it is “at the beginning of a journey that will be key to Somalia’s sustainable development and poverty reduction, as well as the continued development of the stable state and civil institutions,” Somalia’s Minister of Petroleum & Mineral Resources, Abdirashid Mohamed Ahmed, said.Related: OPEC May Have An Extra-Bullish Surprise For Oil MarketsSomalia currently doesn’t produce oil, but hopes that it could hold a lot of oil and gas as “recently completed seismic programs highlighted similar geological structures to those with proven oil & gas reserves in neighboring basins located in Seychelles, Madagascar, Kenya, Tanzania, and Mozambique indicating that Somalia could become one of the most significant oil plays in offshore East Africa,” the oil ministry said in May.Somalia launched in February a licensing round for 15 blocks, tentatively setting the bid date for November 7, 2019.



The country hopes that seismic surveys and drilling of exploration wells could begin in 2020-2021.  While drafting the details of an oil bid round, Somalia will also have to attend hearings in September 2019 at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague over its maritime dispute with Kenya. In February this year, Kenya broke diplomatic relations with neighbor Somalia after a row over several oil and gas blocks escalated into an open conflict.

Now that there are no sanction waivers for Iranian oil buyers, the United States will sanction any imports of crude oil from Iran, the U.S. Special Representative for Iran, Brian Hook, said on Friday, reiterating comments he made last month amid reports that China has already imported its first crude oil cargo from Iran that breaches the U.S. sanctions.“We will sanction any imports of Iranian crude oil,” Hook said in London, as carried by Reuters.   Last month, Hook said that the United States would sanction any country that tries to buy Iranian oil after the sanction waivers expired on May 2, regardless of whether said country had reached its negotiated cap under the exemptions, clarifying earlier comments that resulted in speculation that the U.S. would allow countries that hadn’t reached their cap of Iranian imports to continue buying oil from Iran until they reach that cap.



Speaking today, Hook echoed his remarks from the end of May, saying, as carried by Reuters:“We will sanction any illicit purchases of Iranian crude oil.”Hook also said that the U.S. would be looking to check reports that Iranian crude oil tankers have departed and arrived in China after the U.S. removed all sanction waivers for all Iranian crude oil customers, including the biggest buyer, China.



Earlier this week, an analysis of TankerTrackers showed that Iran had delivered the first crude oil to a Chinese refinery complex since the United States removed as of May all sanction waivers for Iranian oil customers.According to TankerTrackers, a medium-sized Suezmax vessel, named SALINA, owned by the National Iranian Tanker Company (NITC), and loaded with around 1 million barrels of crude oil from Iran, departed on May 28.

The four biggest oil buyers in Asia, all of which were regular Iranian customers until recently, imported in May the lowest volume of crude from Iran since at least 2014, Reuters reported on Friday, citing data from trade sources and government estimates.   China and India—Iran’s no.1 and no.2 oil buyers, respectively—significantly cut imports from Iran after the United States ended as of May 2 all sanction waivers for all Iranian customers, the data collected by Reuters showed. South Korea and Japan, the other two major Asian oil importers, completely cut off oil trade with Iran in May.  Combined, the four Asian countries imported just 386,021 bpd of oil from Iran in May, a 78.5-percent plunge compared to 1,798,090 bpd of imports in May last year, and the lowest monthly imports from Iran since at least 2014, when Reuters began tracking those shipments.



Chinese imports from Iran plummeted by 63.1 percent annually to 254,021 bpd in May, while India’s purchases slumped by 81.3 percent to 132,000 bpd, according to the data.In April, Asia’s imports from Iran hit a nine-month high as the biggest oil importers in Asia rushed to buy Iranian oil before waivers expire.South Korea, for example, imported some 353,000 bpd of Iranian crude in April, up 17 percent on March ahead of the removal of sanction waivers.Related: Oil Prices Hinge On These Two Major Events



China, for its part, imported around 800,000 bpd of crude from Iran in April—the highest amount that Iran’s top oil customer purchased since August last year—as Chinese refiners rushed to buy Iranian oil ahead of the expiry of the U.S. sanction waiver at the beginning of May.Yet, it appears that China is not cutting off its oil imports from Iran. Earlier this week, an analysis from TankerTrackers.com said that Iran had delivered the first crude oil to a Chinese refinery complex since the United States removed the waivers.

Norway’s Finance Ministry asked on Friday the government’s US$1-trillion fund—the world’s biggest sovereign wealth fund—to recommend a schedule for phasing out its investments in pure exploration and production energy companies.  Norway’s Parliament approved earlier this month plans by the fund to divest from oil and gas exploration companies in a landmark decision that could impact future investor attitude toward fossil fuels.In a letter sent today to Norges Bank, the bank managing the fund, the finance ministry said:“Norges Bank is therefore requested to assess which subsectors will, based on FTSE Russell’s changes with effect from 1 July 2019, encompass exploration and production companies in the current subsector «0533 Exploration and Production», as well as a time schedule for the phaseout of the equity investments in exploration and production companies from the Fund’s strategic benchmark index and investment universe.”The ministry also asks Norges Bank “to review its efforts relating to climate risk” in the fund’s investments.The bank has until September 13, 2019, to respond with a recommended time schedule for divesting from E&P firms.After months of deliberations, Norway’s government proposed in March that the Government Pension Fund Global, as the so-called oil fund is officially known, divest from 134 companies classified by the index provider FTSE Russell as belonging to the exploration and production subsector.The move by the fund, which has amassed its vast wealth on the back of Norway’s oil and gas revenues, comes at a time when investors are increasingly pressing major oil companies to start taking climate change seriously and to prepare their business portfolios for a world of peak oil demand, whenever that may come.Norway, however, is motivating its decision with financial reasons, aiming to cut exposure to the oil price risk. More importantly, the fund will not be divesting from any of the integrated Big Oil firms.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Oil Prices Hinge On These Two Major EventsThe Oil Crisis Saudi Arabia Can't SolveThis Continent Is Taking The Lead In Record Shattering Year For LNG

China exported about 847,700 mt of gasoline in May 2019, a drop of about 326,900 mt or 27.8% from April, according to data from the country's General Administration of Customs (GAC).On a year-on-year comparison, May exports slumped by about 622,300 mt or 42.3%, the GAC data indicates. 



The plunge might be due to limited quotas after large exports earlier this year. The country didn't issue this year's second batch of quotas for refined oil exports until the middle of May.Gasoline exports in January-May amounted to about 5.78 million mt, a fall of 7.39% from the same period in 2018, versus a year-on-year boost of 3.26% in January-April, the GAC data says.



China has been boosting gasoline exports as domestic supply grows faster than demand.

Some 3,000 people in Canada’s oil and gas industry lost their jobs between April and May this year, a new report from Petroleum Labour Market Information found as cited by The Star. According to the report, this represented a decline of a bit over 2 percent with more jobs opening in other industries, notably healthcare and education.Unsurprisingly, it was the exploration and drilling segments of the industry that suffered the hardest blow as Canadian producers curb investment in these activities to focus on ongoing projects amid a persistent pipeline shortage that is constraining their expansion plans.



A PetroLMI official, however, said the job losses could be a temporary occurrence: the spring is a slow period for Canadian oil as the frost thaws, the ground gets muddy and unsuitable for drilling until it dries. Still, the abovementioned factors may have contributed and they could drive a longer-term job loss in the industry.An earlier report from PetroLMI found that this year’s hiring requirements of Canada’s oil and gas industry will be 8,236 people lower than a year ago, with projected employment for the year seen at 173,348. That’s almost 12,500 people fewer to be hired by the industry because of slower activity.



This is understandable in light of spending projections for Canada’s oil and gas from PetroLMI. The agency calculated that capital spending on conventional oil and gas this year will be 28 percent lower this year than last, at US$15.28 billion (C$20 billion). Capex in the oil sands segment was seen down 5 percent to US$9.17 billion (C$12 billion).With this year’s projected job losses in the oil and gas industry, the total lost since the 2014 crisis struck could reach 23 percent of the total five years ago. At the time, Canada’s oil and gas industry employed 226,500 people.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Oil Industry Boosts Spending… But There’s A CatchFailing Trade Talks Could Send Oil To $30China Launches World’s First Smart Oil Tanker

The California Public Utilities Commission has opened a probe into Sempra Energy’s Southern California Gas Co. to determine whether a penalty will be assessed for a gas leak from 2015 that drove several thousand people in Los Angeles out of their homes.The Associated Press reports the new probe follows an earlier investigation into the accident that concluded the leak had been the result of pipe corrosion and safety failures, as well as regulatory inadequacies. However, the main blame falls on the company, which had neglected several earlier well failures at its natural gas storage facility in Aliso Canyon. It also failed to take precautions against future ones, the first investigation concluded.



Now, Southern California Gas Co. has 30 days to present a case in its defense. The California PUC is also investigating both SoCalGas and Sempra to determine whether safety is a priority in its corporate culture.The 2015 Aliso Canyon blowout caused the largest known release of methane from a manmade facility, according to a study by the University of California in Los Angeles. The study found the blowout coincided and mixed up with a number of air pollutants that pose a threat to public health. As a result, residents of the area where the methane release was blown into suffered headaches, nausea, and even nose bleeds.



“More than 300 natural gas storage fields within the United States use depleted oil wells, many of them aging, with very little oversight as to how they should be updated,” said the lead author of the study, Michael Jerrett. “Given the potential for future events like the one that occurred at Aliso Canyon, it’s essential that we continue to learn about the health risks both during these active blowout events and as residents who evacuate return to their homes,” he added.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Middle East Tensions Move Oil Prices HigherThe West Just Made A Big Mistake In Middle EastThe Oil Crisis Saudi Arabia Can't Solve

The most prolific oil-producing basin in the United States is set to get a pipeline capacity boost by the end of the third quarter, a source with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Thursday.Plains All American Pipeline’s Cactus II line is on track to be filled within a week—a necessary step prior to sending commercial quantities of crude oil through the pipeline. Oil will begin flowing on a regular basis by the end of the third quarter, the Reuters source showed.



The Cactus II system of pipelines moves oil from Wink, Texas to Corpus Christi, with a total capacity of 670,000 barrels per day at its full completion, according to Plains All American.The Cactus II project will go a long way in relieving some of the capacity constraints in the region that have pressed down Midland crude prices in relation to WTI.



There has been a mad dash to increase takeaway capacity in the Permian region as production has outstripped its ability to move the oil, and Plains All American has already committed fully its entire available capacity, according to Kallanish Energy, much of which is committed to Trafigura. Trafigura signed last year a long-term agreement to move 300,000 bpd of crude and condensate through Plains’ Cactus II.The excitement around this project—and many others like it—highlight the glaring problem of such a simple imbalance: it takes days to drill a well and years to build a pipeline, Bernadette Johnson, VP of market intelligence at Drillinginfo, told Dallas News last year. And production in the Permian has increased quickly.

The UK became on Thursday the first major economy in the world to enshrine in a law its target to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050, two weeks after the government announced plans to pass the net zero emissions pledge into law.Under the law, the UK will be required to have net zero carbon emissions by 2050, compared to a previous target of at least an 80-percent emissions reduction from 1990 levels.According to UK government figures from March 2019, provisional estimates suggest that total UK greenhouse gas emissions last year were 43.5 percent lower than in 1990 and 2.5 percent lower than in 2017, thanks to a shift in the UK’s electricity generation mix toward renewables and away from coal-fired power generation.



Commenting on the new law passed today, the UK’s Energy and Clean Growth Minister Chris Skidmore said:“We’re pioneering the way for other countries to follow in our footsteps driving prosperity by seizing the economic opportunities of becoming a greener economy.”Related: $4.5-Trillion: The Price Tag of A Fossil Fuel-Free U.S.Last month, the Committee on Climate Change, the UK’s independent climate advisory body, recommended that the country set the 2050 net zero emissions target, calling on the UK government to urgently adopt new policies for anything from eating habits to energy consumption to avert the worst effects of climate change.



The UK’s oil and gas authorities, however, have a goal to maximize oil and gas recovery in the North Sea, which, climate groups warn, is undermining the Paris Agreement goals of the UK.According to Friends of the Earth UK, the country could achieve net zero emissions if it phases out polluting cars by 2030, generates 8 times more renewable electricity, shifts from natural gas in heating and replace it with renewables, doubles the tree cover in the UK, and halves food waste by 2030. If the government were to follow these steps, it could get the UK to net zero by 2045 or even earlier, according to Friends of the Earth UK. The government, however, is not in a rush to act on any of these, although it aims for a cleaner and greener economy.

The government of Alberta, Canada is looking to offload its massive oil-by-rail program in what the Alberta Energy Minister Sonya Savage described as “highly confidential” negotiations, according to a Thursday news release.The news is just the latest in a series of dramatic political developments in Canada’s oil industry that has caused deep rifts between parties as the future of its oil business is reshaped one hard-fought battle at a time.The NDP government had promised back in February lucrative outflows from getting its hands in the oil by rail business at a price tag of nearly $4 billion. The windfall was expected to be over $2 billion over three years.  Now the Energy Ministry is signing a different tune—the project is now supposed to generate a loss, rather than substantial income. A large loss of $1.5 billion.



Regardless of the merits of this information or the information presented in February, Alberta is now heading for the oil-by-rail exit, enlisting the help of CIBC Capital Markets to divest from this pricey endeavor by selling it off to the private sector. A deal is expected by fall.“As a government we are accountable to the taxpayer,” Savage said on Thursday.The oil by rail project taken on the government was supposed to help Alberta move its oil to customers as pipeline capacity is already maxed, interfering with getting its oil to market. In the meantime, Canada has reduced oil production on a non-voluntary basis to help prop up prices as the outflow capacity is simply not enough to keep oil inventories from growing unchecked.



The production cuts were successful in shoring up the discount to WTI, which had reached $45 per barrel at the time of the cuts in late 2018, to about $12 per barrel today. The government also announced today that it will again ease the restrictions come August—to 3.74 million barrels per day, according to the Calgary Herald.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Protracted Trade War Inflicts Lasting Damage To U.S. LNGIs This The Beginning Of The End For Tesla’s Solar Business?Solid State Batteries: The Next Big Thing In Electric Cars

Mexico’s planned US$8-billion oil refinery in the home state of President Andrés Manuel López Obrador would have a ‘severe’ impact on air quality in the area, Reuters reported on Thursday, citing an unredacted version of the environmental impact assessment that state oil firm Pemex has made.Pemex will be the company to work on the refinery project, a key campaign pledge of leftist President López Obrador who promised to reduce Mexico’s reliance on fuel and refined product imports, most of which come from the United States.The publicly available version of the environmental impact assessment is overall positive, according to Reuters. Many environmental impacts of the planned refinery would be ‘moderate’, but there would be a ‘severe’ impact on air quality in the area in Dos Bocas, in López Obrador’s home state of Tabasco, according to the assessment that Reuters has reviewed.   



Last month, Mexico scrapped plans to tender the construction of the refinery to foreign companies, saying that it would be Pemex that would oversee the project. According to López Obrador, the foreign firms would be unable to meet the government deadline to have the project ready by 2022 and weren’t happy with the US$8-billion price tag.“The company has secured the financial, technical, human and material resources necessary to complete the project,” Pemex said in a statement in May. According to Pemex and López Obrador, the entire project will cost US$8.35 billion (160 billion Mexican pesos) and will create 100,000 jobs. Construction is expected to conclude in May 2022.Analysts, however, doubt that Mexico could complete the project on time and on budget, which could put additional strain on the already stretched finances of the government and Pemex.



According to Moody’s, the project is expected to exceed the planned budget—in a big way—because of Mexico’s “limited know-how” in such large-scale ventures.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Failing Trade Talks Could Send Oil To $30Gasoline Prices Soar As Largest East Coast Refiner Is Set To Close ShopOil Industry Boosts Spending… But There’s A Catch

Mexico’s President Andrés Manuel López Obrador—who criticizes his predecessor’s energy reforms—said on Thursday that the natural gas pipeline contracts that the previous administration had signed were ‘abusive’ and ‘unfair’ to the Mexican state, raising additional concerns whether the new administration will respect previously signed energy deals.  Six months into office, the populist left-wing President López Obrador blasted earlier this month the energy reform as “a failure” and vowed not to call new bidding rounds for foreign oil companies for oil exploration and production in Mexico unless those companies show results, because currently they are not investing and not producing.Earlier this week, Mexico’s state utility CFE sought arbitration in a dispute over a natural gas pipeline that TC Energy, formerly TransCanada, and Mexican company IEnova, a unit of U.S. Sempra Energy, are building from Texas to Tuxpan on the Mexican Gulf coast.



The companies announced earlier this month that the pipeline they are building had achieved mechanical completion, but the state utility CFE also has to issue verification that the pipeline had been completed.In the request for arbitration, CFE seeks “fairer” terms for a number of pipeline projects signed by the previous Mexican administration.According to analysts, the arbitration could not only delay the in-service date of pipelines, but it could also hurt investor sentiment about whether Mexico intends to respect already signed contracts.  



Canada’s Ambassador to Mexico, Pierre Alarie, said on Wednesday that he was “deeply concerned” about CFE’s move and the signal it sends that Mexico, despite López Obrador’s pledges, appears “not to wish to respect the gas pipeline contracts.”Asked about the gas pipeline dispute, López Obrador said at his regular weekly press conference, as carried by Reuters: “Here it was stated that those contracts were abusive. I called them unfair contracts because they were handed over with all the benefits for the companies.”    By Tsvetana Paraskova or Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:The West Just Made A Big Mistake In Middle EastSaudi Aramco Says It's Ready For Strait Of Hormuz DisruptionMiddle East Tensions Move Oil Prices Higher

Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel sued on Thursday Enbridge to shut down the dual oil pipelines running under the Straits of Mackinac because, she said, the 66-year-old pipelines “present an unacceptable risk to the Great Lakes.”Nessel, a Democrat, also filed on Thursday a motion to dismiss Enbridge’s lawsuit from early this month that seeks to enforce agreements between the company and the administration of the previous Michigan Governor, Republican Rick Snyder, which had authorized Enbridge to build a tunnel and continue operating Line 5.  In the final days of the administration of outgoing Governor Snyder, the Michigan Legislature approved in December 2018 the Great Lakes pipeline project that envisages the replacement of a section of Enbridge’s Line 5 pipeline and agreed to set up a state authority to oversee the construction of a tunnel for a section of the new pipeline.



The new Governor of Michigan, Gretchen Whitmer, however, ordered in March the suspension of all work on the tunnel. The order followed an opinion by the new AG Nessel, who said the bill that allowed the construction of the tunnel violated the state constitution because “it went beyond what the bill’s title reflected.”Nessel threatened in April to “use every resource available” to shut down Enbridge’s Line 5 oil pipeline, and made good on that promise today. “I have consistently stated that Enbridge’s pipelines in the Straits need to be shut down as soon as possible because they present an unacceptable risk to the Great Lakes,” Nessel said in a statement on Thursday.



“Governor Whitmer tried her best to reach an agreement that would remove the pipelines from the Straits on an expedited basis, but Enbridge walked away from negotiations and instead filed a lawsuit against the state,” Nessel added.“The continued operation of Line 5 presents an extraordinary, unreasonable threat to the public because of the very real risk of further anchor strikes, the inherent risks of pipeline operations, and the foreseeable, catastrophic effects if an oil spill occurs at the Straits,” said the Michigan AG. “We were extraordinarily lucky that we did not experience a complete rupture of Line 5 because, if we did, we would be cleaning up the Great Lakes and our shorelines for the rest of our lives, and the lives of our children as well,” she noted.  By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Is This The Beginning Of The End For Tesla’s Solar Business?Protracted Trade War Inflicts Lasting Damage To U.S. LNGIs This The Beginning Of The End For Tesla’s Solar Business?

Venezuela’s President Maduro said the country’s security forces had prevented an attempt on his life planned by the opposition and supported by the United States, Colombia, and Chile, the BBC reports, adding that the plot envisaged replacing the incumbent president of the country with a former defense minister.Juan Guaido, the leader of the Venezuelan opposition who declared himself interim president in January, denied the accusations, saying there had been so many such accusations, the media had “lost count” of them.



In a televised address to the nation, Maduro said ""We would be ruthless in a revolutionary counteroffensive against a attempted fascist coup - ruthless!"" as quoted by Al Jazeera following a statement by his spokesman that said the security forces had uncovered a network of police officers and soldiers—most of them retired—who planned to bomb an unnamed but important government building, seize control of an airbase, and “loot Venezuela’s central bank.”Interestingly enough, the network, according to the statement, was not affiliated with opposition leader Juan Guaido. In fact, spokesman Jorge Rodriguez said, they had panned to oust Guaido from Venezuela’s political life as well.



This is a new twist in the Venezuelan saga, which has so far focused on the fight between Guaido’s opposition and the Maduro government. The U.S. was quick to recognize Guaido as the legitimate, though interim, leader of Venezuela and has helped his efforts to oust Maduro by giving the Venezuelan opposition control over PDVSA’s U.S. business, Citgo.Guaido, for his part, has been sparing no effort to rally supporters to protest against Maduro but though large-scale, the protests have failed to enable a regime change. In April, Guaido announced that the military had switched allegiances and was backing his claim to the Venezuelan helm in what he called the “final phase” of his regime-change plan, but that turned out to be an exaggeration and Maduro remains in power.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Solid State Batteries: The Next Big Thing In Electric CarsFailing Trade Talks Could Send Oil To $30Gasoline Prices Soar As Largest East Coast Refiner Is Set To Close Shop

Forces of the UN-recognized Government of National Accord in Libya have seized a town near Tripoli that served as the main supply base for the Libyan National Army of General Khalifa Haftar who is fighting the GNA for control of the capital.Reuters reported the news quoting witnesses, noting the takeover of the town of Gharyan is a serious blow to Haftar’s forces, which are affiliated with the rival eastern government of Libya. The LNA launched an attack on Tripoli in April and fighting has been going on since then without any significant advances by either side.



The GNA-affiliated forces, according to the Reuters sources, stormed Gharyan early in the morning on Wednesday in a surprise attack that ensured their success. The LNA was forced out of the town and the GNA army took over its central operations room, field hospitals, and a helicopter base.The LNA, however, has one more base in the vicinity, in the town of Tarhouna, which it could use to launch a response to the taking of Gharyan or continue its advance on Tripoli.



Ever since the fighting started in April, Libya’s National Oil Corporation has been warning that hostilities could threaten production, and this time, the situation could be worse than at the start of the civil war in 2011. The threat is rising at a time when NOC is making progress towards recovering Libya’s oil production after a slump following the civil war. Without the outages, the country produces about 1 million bpd.At the same time, despite the fighting, the country’s production could double in five years. Right now, despite the deterioration in its security situation, Libya exported more oil during the second quarter of the year, according to data from IHS Markit, at an average of 960,000 bpd. That’s 40 percent above the average for the first quarter when the Sharara field—Libya’s largest—was offline.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Failing Trade Talks Could Send Oil To $30Gasoline Prices Soar As Largest East Coast Refiner Is Set To Close ShopOil Industry Boosts Spending… But There’s A Catch

Official Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and US-recognized Venezuelan President Juan Guaido are both vying for control over PDVSA’s refinery in the United States—Citgo—and a US court is set to decide who will control it, according to Reuters.Citgo Petroleum Corp., one of the largest oil refineries in the United States, is currently clumsily operating with two dueling boards of directors—one appointed by Maduro and one appointed by Guaido, and both are digging in over the power struggle for Venezuela’s US-based refinery. Maduro filed a lawsuit yesterday in a Delaware court, according to Reuters, to officially recognize Maduro’s hand-picked board in order to take control over Citgo’s $30 billion in revenue.



The Venezuelan Supreme Court has previously ruled in Maduro’s favor, but the ruling did little to encourage Guaido to step aside when it comes to the critical asset. Guaido’s appointed chairwoman is the one who has been running Citgo in the United States.Citgo said that it was confident that the US courts would recognize Guaido’s claim to appoint directors, and Maduro is unrelenting in trying to usurp his authority. As part of his reclamation efforts, several Citgo executives—five of whom were American citizens—were jailed over a year ago when they returned to Venezuela for a meeting. The so-called Citgo 6 are still in custody awaiting trial, standing accused of corruption, embezzlement, and crafting a debt restructuring deal that was viewed by the Maduro administration as being unfavorable to PDVSA.

Another major OPEC producer wants to boost its natural gas business overseas as the international upstream unit of state-held Kuwait Petroleum Corporation (KPC) aims to significantly raise production from its assets in Canada and Australia, the acting CEO of Kuwait Foreign Petroleum Exploration Company (KUPFEC), Sheikh Nawaf Saud Al-Sabah, told Bloomberg in an interview published on Wednesday.KUPFEC plans to raise production from Canada’s shale gas project Kaybob Duvernay from some 12,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) currently to nearly 20,000 boepd by the end of 2019, Al-Sabah told Bloomberg, adding that production could rise to 60,000 boepd once the project is fully developed in the middle of the next decade.In November last year, the operator of the Duvernay development, Chevron, signed agreements for additional midstream services to support the gas-processing and liquids-handling needs at the project. KUFPEC holds the remaining non-operated 30-percent interest in the project.



Another notable overseas asset of KUFPEC is a 13.4-percent stake in the Wheatstone LNG Project in Australia.Earlier this year, KUPFEC won exploration rights to more blocks in Australia and aims to boost the current 40,000 boepd production and produce more gas for liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports, Al-Sabah told Bloomberg.Kuwait, like Saudi Arabia, is embarking on a natural gas push overseas as it is restricting its oil production as part of the OPEC+ oil cuts deal.



Kuwait, however, has ambitious targets to increase its domestic oil production capacity in the long run. Kuwait plans to raise its crude oil production capacity to 4.75 million bpd by 2040, up from 3.15 million bpd, while more immediate plans are to raise its capacity to 4 million bpd by 2020.OPEC’s largest producer Saudi Arabia is also cutting oil production as part of the deal and it also aims to grow its natural gas business.

Renewables held a larger share than coal in U.S. monthly electricity generation in April 2019, for the first time ever, reflecting seasonal factors and longer-term trends such as coal’s decline and renewables’ rise, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) said on Wednesday.In April 2019, when U.S. electricity demand is often at its lowest because of mild temperatures, renewables including hydropower accounted for 23 percent of U.S. electricity generation, while coal-fired generation accounted for 20 percent of the U.S. electricity mix. Electricity generation from coal, natural gas, and nuclear is often lowest in the spring and fall months because of maintenance amid moderate temperatures and low demand for heating and air conditioning, the EIA said, pointing at the seasonal factors for renewables overtaking coal for the first time.



However, there’s an underlying long-term trend in the U.S. electricity mix—coal generation has been dropping from its peak a decade ago. Since 2015, some 47 GW of U.S. coal-fired capacity has retired, while virtually no new coal capacity has come online, the EIA said.Yet, renewables overtaking coal will be an April blip, as the EIA expects coal to provide more electricity than renewables in the United States for the remaining months of 2019. On an annual average basis, EIA forecasts that coal will provide more electricity generation than renewables both this year and next. However, renewables will surpass nuclear generation next year, according to the EIA.



Earlier this month, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s (FERC) Energy Infrastructure Update with data through April 2019 showed that renewable installed capacity surpassed coal, with renewables accounting for 21.56 percent of total available installed U.S. generating capacity, compared to a 21.55-percent share for coal’s installed capacity.In its inventory of electric generators in January this year, the EIA said that wind, natural gas, and solar capacity will lead the new electricity capacity in the United States in 2019, while coal-fired generation will account for more than half of scheduled capacity retirements.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Nuclear Energy Just Isn’t Competitive In The U.S.Gasoline Prices Soar As Largest East Coast Refiner Is Set To Close ShopSolid State Batteries: The Next Big Thing In Electric Cars

Iran has delivered the first crude oil to a Chinese refinery complex since the United States removed as of May all sanction waivers for Iranian oil customers, including its biggest buyer China, Bourse & Bazaar reports, citing an analysis from TankerTrackers.com.  According to TankerTrackers, a medium-sized Suezmax vessel, named SALINA and owned by the National Iranian Tanker Company (NITC), loaded around 1 million barrels of crude oil from Iran and departed on May 28. The tanker arrived on June 20 at Jinxi Refining and Chemical Complex in China in a first independent tanker-tracking confirmation that China is defying the U.S. sanctions on Iran’s oil exports.The arrival of an Iranian crude cargo at the Jinxi complex, which is ultimately owned and operated by state giant China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), suggests that China is resuming Iranian crude oil imports as part of a government policy, according to Bourse & Bazaar.



Last month, TankerTrackers said on May 16 that it had sighted what was the first confirmed export of crude oil out of Iran since the end of all U.S. waivers on May 2.Iran’s oil exports will greatly depend on how China will proceed with its crude oil imports from the Islamic Republic, if at all, after the U.S. removed the sanction waivers, IHS Markit said in an analysis earlier this month.Despite the U.S. push to drive Iranian oil exports to zero, China is not expected to totally cut off its crude imports from Iran, according to Fotios Katsoulas, Liquid Bulk Principal Analyst, Maritime & Trade at IHS Markit.



Still, Chinese oil imports from Iran will likely be very low for a long period of time going forward, Katsoulas said.China has criticized the U.S. decision to end the sanction waivers and some Chinese refiners may continue to buy Iranian oil amid the U.S.-China trade war and Beijing could simply brush off the U.S. sanctions on Iranian oil.China’s total crude oil imports dropped in May from a monthly record in April, as Chinese refiners drastically reduced Iranian oil imports after the end of the U.S. waivers and as some state refineries were offline for planned maintenance.

Saudi Arabia’s state oil giant Aramco signed on Wednesday a memorandum of understanding with South Korea’s refiner S-Oil—majority held by Aramco—to collaborate on a US$6-billion petrochemical project in South Korea as part of the Saudi strategy to boost its downstream and petrochemical presence in overseas markets.The new steam cracker and olefin project—expected to be completed by 2024—will produce ethylene and other basic chemicals out of naphtha and refinery off-gas.“This new agreement supports Saudi Aramco’s plan to increase its global petrochemicals footprint over the next decade,” Saudi Aramco said in a statement on Wednesday.



S-Oil and Saudi Aramco, whose subsidiary Aramco Overseas Company holds 63.41 percent in South Korea’s third-largest oil refiner by capacity, also opened on Wednesday S-Oil’s new residue upgrading complex and olefin downstream complex as part of the visit of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to South Korea.Aramco also signed a total of 12 agreements worth billions of U.S. dollars with South Korean companies, including Hyundai Heavy Industries, Hyundai Oilbank, and Hyundai Motor Group. Aramco and Korea National Oil Corporation signed a deal under which Aramco will explore the potential of crude oil storage in South Korea to complement its marketing and supply activities. With Hyundai Oilbank, Aramco signed crude oil deals for supply of Arabian and non-Arabian crude oil.While the Kingdom says that it’s working on the Vision 2030 strategy to diversify its economy away from oil, the Saudis and their oil firm are increasingly looking to lock in future oil demand in the refining and chemicals businesses in all major markets in the world to open new avenues of sales for their oil and to make sure that Saudi crude will have a market for years to come.



Earlier this year, Saudi Aramco signed an agreement to buy 9 percent in Zhejiang Petrochemical’s 800,000-bpd integrated refinery and petrochemical complex in China, and is also looking to boost its exposure and investments on another fast-growing oil demand market, India.    By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:‘Climate Apartheid’ Is Looming, UN WarnsTwo Events That Will Determine Oil PricesThe West Just Made A Big Mistake In Middle East

The Refinery and Petrochemical Integrated Development (RAPID) refinery in Malaysia, a joint project of Petronas and Saudi Aramco, is due to come online by the end of this year, S&P Global Platts reports, citing Petronas chief executive Tan Sri Wan Zulkiflee Wan Ariffin.The RAPID facility will have a processing capacity of 300,000 barrels of crude daily, with its petrochemicals production capacity standing at 3.3 million tons annually, the Petronas head said. The project costs US$27 billion and is one of Saudi Arabia’s largest foreign investment projects since the announcement of the Vision 2030 diversification program. Like other refinery investments, it aims to secure long-term demand for Saudi crude amid prospects of a general decline on a global scale in the long run.



""We take the view that there will be demand for petrochemicals. There would be times of volatility but I think the price trend goes up. So we take a very bullish view,"" Tan Sri Wan Zulkiflee Wan Ariffin said, adding, “Construction is almost complete. We are pre-commissioning parts of the plant and we hope to be able to reach commercial operations by end of this year.""The Petronas head also said the companies had made “the bold decision” to proceed with the refinery at a time of depressed oil prices based on the forecasts of rising petrochemicals demand but also on the fact that the refinery will be close to Southeast Asian markets, and especially to China and India.



Saudi Arabia has already committed hefty investments in India, the biggest among them the US$44-billion refinery and petrochemical complex in Ratnagiri, which will be the largest in the country with a capacity of 60 million tons annually. Aramco is participating in the project together with Emirati Adnoc, sharing a 50-percent stake in the project. The company also recently agreed to buy Shell’s stake in a refining company, SASREF, for US$631 million as part of its expansion efforts in the downstream business.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Is This The Beginning Of The End For Tesla’s Solar Business?Is Bakken Oil Production Set For An Unexpected Drop?This Is How The U.S. Plans To Cripple Iran’s Economy

A Texas judge has ruled the Texas Railroad Commission does not have to approve the route of natural gas pipelines, which will allow Kinder Morgan to proceed with a US$2-billion natural gas pipeline project by using eminent domain to take the land it needs for the pipe.Reuters quoted Judge Lora Livingston as saying in the ruling, “The court finds no authority for the proposition that the legislature has granted authority to the Commission to oversee the rights granted,” and dismissed Kinder Morgan from the case that was brought in front of her by a group of landowners and state officials who sought to block the pipeline project.



The Permian Highway pipeline will have a capacity of 2 billion cu ft daily that it will carry to the Gulf Coast refineries, relieving a shortage in the Permian that has depressed not just oil prices but also gas prices as a lot of the associated gas produced from the shale formation cannot be transported or used or stored.It was also because of this shortage of gas pipelines that gas flaring in the Permian hit a record high in the first quarter of the year, according to a report by Rystad Energy. It reached 661 million cu ft daily with the research firm noting, “This widespread waste of a valuable commodity is the result of persistent infrastructure challenges, a lack of sufficient takeaway capacity and an unexpected outage on a key pipeline in the area.”



While the news about Kinder Morgan’s project is good, the pipeline will not be built overnight, so the shortage-caused problems will persist for a while longer. Later this year, in October, another 2-billion-cu-ft gas pipeline should be completed in the Permian—the Gulf Coast Express—and it should alleviate some of the pressure on gas prices. However, gas production is rising, with the total from shale plays seen at 81.4 billion cu ft daily next month.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:The Golden Asteroid That Could Make Everyone On Earth A BillionairePresident Inslee: An Oil Major’s NightmareThe Last Truly Underdeveloped Oil Frontier In The Middle East

The American Petroleum Institute (API) reported a large crude oil inventory draw of 7.55 million barrels for the week ending June 20, but still coming in over analyst expectations of a 2.891-million barrel drawdown in inventories.Last week, the API reported a draw of 812,000 barrels. A day later, the EIA estimated that US inventories had drawn down by 3.1 million barrels.The net build is still 26.69 million barrels for the 26-week reporting period so far this year, using API data.


(Click to enlarge)Oil prices were up earlier on Tuesday as the general expectation was for a drawdown in crude oil inventories in the runup to the data release. Another headwind for higher prices is the continuing tensions in the Middle East.At 12:32pm EST, WTI was trading up by $0.13 (+0.22%) at $58.03—roughly $4.00 over last week’s levels. Brent was trading up $0.24 (+0.37%) at $64.42—about $2.00 more than last week’s figures.The API this week reported a 3.17 million-barrel draw in gasoline inventories for week ending June 20. Analysts estimated a build in gasoline inventories of 217,000 barrels for the week.



Distillate inventories rose by 160,000 barrels for the week, while inventories at Cushing fell by 1.26 million barrels.US crude oil production as estimated by the Energy Information Administration showed that production for the week ending June 14 fell again this week to 12.2 million bpd, a 200,000 dip from the all-time high of 12.4 million barrels per day.  The U.S. Energy Information Administration report on crude oil inventories is due to be released on Wednesday at 10:30a.m. EST.By 4:40pm EST, WTI was trading at $57.87 and Brent was trading at $64.30By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:The West Just Made A Big Mistake In Middle EastIs Bakken Oil Production Set For An Unexpected Drop?This Is How The U.S. Plans To Cripple Iran’s Economy

In a cut above the usual barb-trading between Iran and the United States, President Trump threatened to meet any attack by Iran on “anything American” with “great and overwhelming force,” in a Tuesday afternoon tweet, adding that “in some areas, overwhelming will mean obliteration.”The threat came as Iranian President Hassan Rouhani lashed out at new sanctions levied yesterday, referring to the White House as “mentally retarded” in a televised address.



President Trump called the Islamic Republic’s statement “ignorant and insulting” as the situation goes from bad to worse after yesterday President Trump signed an order to sanction Iran’s Supreme Leader, after Iran shot down a US drone and attacks on oil tankers near the Strait of Hormuz—a critical shipping lane essential for the transport of oil.While President Trump on Monday said that the United States would still be open to negotiations despite the drone attacks and attacks on oil tankers, Iran was not receptive to the idea of negotiations, arguing that the US being open to negotiations on one hand and sanctioning its Supreme Leader on the other was incongruous.



This maximum pressure campaign against Iran, combined with market fears that oil flows through the critical Strait of Hormuz could be disrupted has put a floor under prices that have been otherwise pressured downward by a perceived global oil glut despite OPEC’s best efforts to convince the oil market otherwise. The unrest in the Middle East has even overshadowed Venezuela’s continuously declining production—a factor that has up until recently done much to take over a million barrels a day off the oil market.Oil prices had risen earlier in the day on Tuesday on increased tensions between Iran and the United States in the runup to crude oil inventory data that will be released at 4:30pm EST, already pricing in an expected crude oil draw.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:The West Just Made A Big Mistake In Middle EastShale Pioneer: Fracking Is An “Unmitigated Disaster”China Launches World’s First Smart Oil Tanker

Because of relentless global warming, the world risks plunging into a ‘climate apartheid’—a scenario in which the rich will buy themselves out of the worst effects of climate change, while the poor will be left to suffer the greatest consequences, the UN Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, Philip Alston, said in a report released on Tuesday.Climate change not only threatens people living in poverty more than other groups, but it also threatens democracy and human rights, Alston said in the report, in which he criticizes governments for failing to adequately address the problem with carbon emissions.  According to the UN expert, countries around the world are “failing to meet even their current inadequate commitments to reduce carbon emissions and provide climate financing,” while at the same time they continue to subsidize the fossil fuel industry with US$5.2 trillion every year.



If governments continue to keep the current course of somber speeches not leading to meaningful actions, this would be a “recipe for economic catastrophe,” according to Alston. “Perversely, while people in poverty are responsible for just a fraction of global emissions, they will bear the brunt of climate change, and have the least capacity to protect themselves,” Alston said.“We risk a ‘climate apartheid’ scenario where the wealthy pay to escape overheating, hunger, and conflict while the rest of the world is left to suffer,” the UN expert added.



The UN’s Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) said in a report last year that climate change was among the leading causes of rising global hunger. Climate change—with extreme weather, desertification, land degradation, water scarcity, and rising seas—is already undermining efforts to eradicate hunger, FAO experts said last September.A month later, the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said that the world needs to spend US$2.4 trillion every year through 2035 to slow down the effects of climate change.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Shale Pioneer: Fracking Is An “Unmitigated Disaster”China Launches World’s First Smart Oil TankerThe West Just Made A Big Mistake In Middle East

Kenya’s government signed on Tuesday a heads of agreement with France’s major Total, Africa-focused Tullow Oil, and Africa Oil to develop an oil processing facility with capacity of 60,000 bpd-80,000 bpd, as part of the East African country’s plan to begin commercial oil production within a few years.The heads of agreement provides “a framework and commercial certainty required to move ahead with negotiating the fully termed upstream and midstream long form agreements ahead of the Projects’ Final Investment Decision (FID),” Kenya’s Ministry of Petroleum and Mining said on Twitter on Tuesday.The deal concerns oil fields discovered in the South–Lokichar Basin in Kenya’s north. The partners will now focus on securing financing for the pipeline to ship the crude out of the landlocked northern region, while the oil ministry will aim to finalize the ongoing Front-End Engineering & Design (FEED) and Environmental & Social Impact Assessment (ESIA)—both of which are key to reaching FID, the ministry said.



Commercial quantities of crude oil in Kenya were discovered in 2012 in the South Lokichar Basin. Tullow Oil, which discovered the resources, has continued its exploration and appraisal drilling campaigns in Kenya.In early June last year, Kenya sent the first trucks transporting crude oil from the oil-rich but landlocked northern region of Turkana to the port of Mombassa, for the country’s first oil exports as part of a pilot export scheme.Related: Shale Pioneer: Fracking Is An “Unmitigated Disaster”A deal between Tullow Oil and local Kenyan authorities that would allow the oil company to pump water for the wells and that would be crucial to the FID for Kenya’s first and currently only oil project could be pushed back to the third quarter, Martin Mbogo, Managing Director at Tullow Oil Kenya, said in February this year.



In April, Tullow Oil said in its operations update that it continues to target an FID in Kenya by the end of this year, “although this remains an ambitious target.”An FID at end-2019 remains contingent on the government of Kenya delivering on the ESIAs and ensuring the land required for the upstream project and pipeline, Tullow Oil said at the end of April.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Is Bakken Oil Production Set For An Unexpected Drop?This Is How The U.S. Plans To Cripple Iran’s EconomyA $1 Trillion Energy Opportunity The U.S. Can’t Afford To Miss

Imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) into Northeast Asia are set to decline in June from May, for the first time on record dating back to 2013, amid slowing economies and high storage levels, Reuters reported on Tuesday, citing ship-tracking data from Refinitiv.Typically, LNG demand in the biggest importers of the super-chilled fuel in Northeast Asia—Japan, China, South Korea, and Taiwan—increases month on month in June because of higher gas demand for air conditioning in northern hemisphere summers.  This year, however, Northeast Asian imports are set for a decline this month compared to last month, with Chinese LNG imports seen as the main drag on lower imports. China’s LNG imports are expected to fall by 9 percent in June compared to May due to the slow switch from coal to natural gas as economic growth weakens, according to Reuters estimates.  



The key LNG importers in Northeast Asia are also expected to see the growth in their monthly LNG imports drop in the first half of this year for the first time since 2015, according to Refinitiv data crunched by Reuters.  While global LNG supply is expected to grow by 14 percent this year, slowing demand growth in Asia may not be enough to absorb all the supply that’s due to come online this year, James Taverner at consultancy IHS Markit told Reuters.China breakneck demand surge of the past two years is expected to slow this year as Beijing is determined to avoid severe shortages by boosting pipeline connectivity, building more storage and import terminals, and raising domestic natural gas production.



“Economic slowdown, a more considered approach on coal-to-gas switching and increased domestic infrastructure availability will mean LNG demand will slow in 2019, from the 40-45% growth we have seen in 2017 and 2018,” energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie said in its 2019 LNG outlook in early January.“But China will still grow at around 20%, by far the largest source of LNG demand growth in the global market,” according to WoodMac.  By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:China’s Risky Move To Boost Domestic Oil ProductionShale Pioneer: Fracking Is An “Unmitigated Disaster”China Launches World’s First Smart Oil Tanker

Ukraine’s gas in storage reached 13 billion cubic meters as of June 22 as the country prepares for a worst-case scenario in which it loses its role as the main channel for Russian gas into Europe, state news agency Unian reported, noting the amount of gas represented 42 percent of storage capacity. This, according to Emerging Europe, is the highest amount of gas in storage in six years.Russia has denied that it will cut off Ukraine from its gas transportation system—which would cause serious losses of transit fee revenues—but Kiev has insisted Moscow wants to do just that by expanding the Nord Stream pipeline. Currently, Gazprom and Naftogaz, which is the parent company of Ukrtransgaz, are negotiating the terms of their future transit dealings after they finally settled a court case in which both sides accused the other of wrongdoing.



Ukraine has been quick to warn of a looming gas crisis: the country’s deputy foreign minister Olena Zerkal said earlier this month, as quoted by Bloomberg, “While Russia holds off the negotiations on future contract, the gloomy scenario of a gas crisis shall be considered seriously. That is why every European nation, including Ukraine, is increasing gas stock in storage sites.”The new deal needs to be negotiated by next January when the current contract expires. Russia’s Alexander Novak said talks are in the process of being scheduled for September and would involve Ukraine, Russia, and representatives of the European Union, which gets more than a third of its gas supply from Russia, most of it via Ukraine.



Also earlier this month, a Naftogaz official offered an alternative to the direct gas transit: he said Gazprom could sell the gas directly to Naftogaz at the Russian-Ukrainian border and then the Ukrainian company would sell it on to European states. Given that Gazprom has repeatedly accused Naftogaz of not paying its dues for the transit, the chances of the Russian major accepting this sort of deal are slim.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Shale Pioneer: Fracking Is An “Unmitigated Disaster”China Launches World’s First Smart Oil TankerHedge Funds Halt Selloff In Oil As Mid-East Tensions Spike

The federal Canadian government is investing US$208 million (C$275 million) in the LNG Canada project: the first of this magnitude in the country and the energy project that won the heart of the fossil fuel-wary government of British Columbia.CBC quotes Finance Minister Bill Morneau as saying ""The Government of Canada is proud to support this historic $40 billion project that will get our resources to new markets.""The project is indeed historic: it is the second one proposed for the western Canadian cost, which would get local LNG to global markets and the first that may actually succeed after Petronas pulled the plug on the first one citing unfavorable market conditions. It is because of this bad experience perhaps that both provincial and federal governments are supporting the project in any way they can.



Ottawa’s money would go into buying energy-efficient gas turbines for the project, to be located in Kitimat, B.C., as well as a replacement for the Haisla Bridge in the town as the project would lead to a lot more intensive traffic.Earlier this year, the British Columbia government for its part announced tax incentives for energy companies to make sure the project will go through. ""British Columbians are counting on us to attract LNG investment that meets strict conditions: delivering jobs and financial benefits to B.C., creating economic partnerships with Indigenous peoples and protecting our clean air, land and water,"" the province’s Finance Minister Carole James said at the time.The five companies behind the US$31 billion (C$40 billion) LNG Canada project announced their final investment decision on the project last October, ending months of uncertainty and worry that the large-scale project could become the second failed LNG initiative in British Columbia after Petronas quit its proposed Pacific North West project on depressed LNG prices.



Now, the project partners are so optimistic, it seems, that the facility might end up with twice the originally planned capacity of 14 million tons of LNG.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Hedge Funds Halt Selloff In Oil As Mid-East Tensions SpikeShale Pioneer: Fracking Is An “Unmitigated Disaster”China Launches World’s First Smart Oil Tanker

Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh is denying media reports that have depicted Iran’s oil exports as declining in the face of US sanctions, but did not offer alternate figures, according to Tehran Times, who cited IRIB.In late May, media reported that Iran’s exports had been down month on month, more than 2 million barrels per day off their April 2018 peak of 2.5 million barrels per day. At the time, Reuters reported that Iran’s May 2019 exports plunged to just 400,000 barrels per day—a shadow of a figure that Iran now vehemently says is false.



Zanganeh did not provide different figures, adding that it was not in the country’s best interest to do it. Since the levying of sanctions by the United States, Iran has used tactics such as switching off transponders that would allow its oil exports to be quantified and tracked, making the estimates of its oil exports just that—estimates. Iran is now claiming it has new tactics to shield its exports, as well as new destinations for its oil, but failed to provide further details.OPEC is likely struggling to come up with a game plan ahead of its July meeting in the absence of accurate data regarding Iran’s oil production and exports. A new wild card was played late last week, with Russia pledging its devotion to helping Iran export its oil, including helping with Iran’s banking sector, as Europe has so far been unable or unwilling to bring online its Instex payment system that would allow it to continue purchasing Iranian oil in defiance of US sanctions.



If Russia follows through with its commitment to assist Iran with its oil exports, or if Europe ever gets its payment system up and running, the United States will have a difficult time bringing its oil exports to zero.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads from Oilprice.com:Two Events That Will Determine Oil PricesThe West Just Made A Big Mistake In Middle EastThe Irony of California’s Oil Dependence

The International Energy Agency (IEA) is very worried about the growing tension in the Middle East and stands ready to act in case of physical disruption to oil supply, the IEA’s executive director Fatih Birol said on Monday.“We are monitoring the situation very closely and are very worried. In case of physical disruption, we are ready to act in an appropriate way,” Birol said at a conference on energy efficiency in Dublin, as carried by Reuters.The tension in the Middle East nearly reached a tipping point last week after Iran shot down a U.S. drone over the Strait of Hormuz, claiming it had violated Iran’s air space. The U.S. says that the drone was in international air space.The U.S. had apparently prepared a response to the downing of the drone with strikes on Iranian targets, before President Trump stopped a planned strike 10 minutes before it begins, because, he said, it was “not proportionate to shooting down an unmanned drone.”Earlier this month, two oil tankers were attacked in the Gulf of Oman, just outside the Strait of Hormuz, the vital shipping lane which connects the Persian Gulf with the Gulf of Oman and the open seas and which accounts for around 30 percent of all seaborne-traded crude oil and other liquids.According to the IEA’s Birol, the oil price response to the heightened tension between the U.S. and Iran and in the Middle East as a whole would have been much greater were it not for the surging U.S. shale oil production, which has been capping significant price gains.“[D]espite those attacks, we have not seen a major impact on the prices and the main reason is United States shale oil prices are growing so strongly that there is a lot of oil in the markets now,” Birol said on Monday, noting that a lid on oil price gains is “very good news for consumers around the world.”  By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:The Irony of California’s Oil DependenceTwo Events That Will Determine Oil PricesThe West Just Made A Big Mistake In Middle East

India more than quadrupled its imports of U.S. crude oil between November last year and May this year as the U.S. sanctions on Iran significantly reduced Iranian crude purchases at refiners in India, which was Iran’s second-largest oil customer until last month.According to tanker arrival data that Reuters has obtained from industry and shipping sources, the growth in U.S. oil supplies to India was significantly higher than the increase of Indian purchases of oil from its traditional Middle Eastern sources of supply.Between November 2018 and May 2019—the period in which the U.S. slapped sanctions on Iran’s oil exports allowing six-month exemptions for the largest buyers, including India, and the end of those waivers in May—Indian refiners bought around 184,000 bpd of U.S. crude oil, up from just 40,000 bpd in the same period the previous year.



Between the start of the U.S. sanctions and the end of all waivers for Iranian buyers, India’s intake of Iranian crude oil slumped to 275,000 bpd, down by 48 percent on the year, according to the tanker data cited by Reuters.During the November-May period, India’s purchases of Saudi crude oil increased by 11 percent to 804,000 bpd and imports from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) surged by 37 percent to 360,000 bpd, while purchases from Iraq went down 3.3 percent to 1.01 million bpd.Related: The End Of Mexico’s Rigorous Energy ReformAlthough the volumes from the U.S. were low compared to those of India’s traditional Middle Eastern suppliers, the growth in U.S. imports obliterated the rise in Middle East shipments, also because the official selling prices (OSPs) of Saudi Aramco and other Middle East oil producers have been higher, enabling the U.S. to sell its oil to India.   



The U.S. moved in to fill part of the gap from Iranian supplies and is keen to further increase its crude oil sales to India.Earlier this month, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that the U.S. wants to deliver more liquefied natural gas (LNG) and crude oil to India.“These steps will give Indians reliable, affordable, diversified energy independence so they will no longer have to rely on difficult regimes like those in Venezuela and in Iran,” Secretary Pompeo said at a U.S.-India business meeting on June 12.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Trump: We Won’t Protect Foreign Oil Tankers For FreeHedge Funds Halt Selloff In Oil As Mid-East Tensions SpikeThe West Just Made A Big Mistake In Middle East

Five underwater pipelines carrying crude oil were sabotaged this weekend, the Syrian Petroleum and Mineral Resources Ministry said, as reported by state news agency SANA.The ministry said a leak from the pipelines was discovered on Saturday and divers carried out an inspection to find out that not one but five pipelines had been damaged. The damage done, however, must not have been extensive, because the ministry also said repairs have started immediately and the pipelines would return to normal operation in hours.



A later statement by the Minister of Petroleum and Mineral Resources, Ali Ghanem, said that six pipelines had been vandalized. The network carries crude oil from the coast to tankers at the port of Banias. The port city houses one of Syria’s two refineries. The other is located in Homs, in central Syria.Last month U.S.-led forces blew up three oil tankers in Syria in the latest push against the Syrian government which is fighting rebel groups in their last remaining stronghold in Syria, in Idlib.



Syria is heavily dependent on crude oil imports through the Mediterranean, with a lot of the oil coming from Iran. Before the civil war broke out in 2011, the country produced some 350,000 bpd, the AP reports, while now production averages some 24,000 bpd, while consumption is about 136,000 bpd.U.S. sanctions against Syria and Iran have affected supply gravely, however, with a series of fuel shortages resulting from the U.S. and European sanctions against Syria and the U.S. sanctions on Iran that have caused a squeeze in Iran’s shipments abroad. According to Kpler data, Iran’s crude oil loading over the first half of June averaged 645,000 bpd, but most of this did not end up at an importing country’s ports: according to the data provider, some 82 percent of the oil is still floating in the Persian Gulf.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Oil Holds Steady Amid Small Rig Count DeclineNew York On The Verge Of Passing Very Aggressive Clean Energy BillNorway Just Triggered An Offshore Wind Energy Boom

The Iranian security forces have arrested a group of people that Iranian media report were trying to influence officials at the country’s oil ministry into “putting off important decisions” and “making wrong decisions” to the benefit of the United States.According to Fars News, which cited a senior legislator, the spy team “operated under a woman who had been able to influence 16 important and influential managers of the oil ministry to put off important decisions in the ministry and hit a blow to the country in the US economic war against Iran.”The arrests followed the execution of a former employee of the Aerospace Industries Organization—a unit of the Defense Ministry—for working for the U.S. and the CIA, specifically.



""It is interesting to know that a while ago, the Iranian intelligence apparatus discovered and cracked down on one of the most complicated cyber networks of the CIA which was used for cyber spying and was an important part of the CIA's operational capacities in the countries targeted by the US,"" said the Secretary of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council, Ali Shamkhani.The former ministry employee, Jalal Haji Zavar, was executed after being tried by a military court, Iranian and other media reported this weekend, and after he had confessed to working for the CIA for pay. The trial and execution of Zavar, however, was not linked to the uncovering of the “cyber network” Ali Shamkhani told media about last week.The apparent crackdown on spies in Iran comes as tensions with the U.S. continue to intensify, with President Trump saying during the weekend there were more sanctions against Tehran in the works and military action was still on the table after Iran shot down a U.S. drone. Initially, the U.S. side rejected the reports of the drone downing, but later confirmed the event.



Meanwhile, U.S. officials told the Associated Press that the Pentagon had launched cyberattacks against Iranian missile control systems disabling the computer systems controlling rocket and missile launchers.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Two Events That Will Determine Oil PricesThe West Just Made A Big Mistake In Middle EastCan Artificial Intelligence Save The Nuclear Industry?

Pemex will avoid investing in deepwater offshore projects, instead focusing on areas where it has experience, including the shallow waters of the Gulf of Mexico and onshore fields, Reuters quoted a senior executive as saying.The Mexican state energy company has been struggling to reverse a production decline that has been going on for more than a decade, but it is also struggling under a substantial debt load, and despite government efforts to prop up its finances, has obviously decided not to go into high-cost deepwater projects for the time being.



To date, Pemex produces about 1.7 million bpd of crude, most of it from onshore and shallow water fields. However, this figure is almost half of the 3.4 million bpd it pumped in 2004. It was this decline that pushed the previous government to launch an extensive overhaul of the energy industry of the country, inviting foreign oil companies to come and bid for new oil and gas projects.The new administration of leftist President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, however, has suspended all oil and gas tenders while it reviews contracts signed by the Pena-Nieto government for signs of corruption. Despite this suspension, which effectively delays potential production gains, Obrador has pledged to enable an increase in oil production to 2.5 million bpd by the end of his term in 2024.



Pemex is already making steps to boost production despite its financial woes. The company in December said it will spend 14 percent more this year than in 2018, at US$23 billion, most of which will be poured into already producing fields as gains there come most quickly.At the time, Pemex’s chief executive Octavio Romero noted that so far, deepwater exploration has not produced particularly impressive results. “At best we’d have the first drop of oil by 2025,” Romero said, after noting that the two previous governments had spent 41 percent of total Pemex investments in deepwater exploration.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:The Oil Company Investors Fear MostHow To Buy Gold For $3 An OunceGlobal Oil Market Surprisingly Oversupplied

India’s oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan reached out to Saudi Arabia on Friday to discuss unrest in the region which is pushing up prices to levels that are putting a financial strain on India, according to a tweet by the oil minister.Pradhan called The Kingdom’s Minister of Energy, Industry, and Mineral resources Khalid Al-Falih to discuss increased cooperation in the hydrocarbon sector and Pradhan’s growing concern about the recent events in the Strait of Hormuz.“Expressed concern on the developments in the Strait of Hormuz leading to rising crude oil price. Reiterated the sensitivity of Indian consumers to prevailing oil price volatility. Sought active role of #SaudiArabia within OPEC & OPEC Plus for keeping oil prices at reasonable levels,” Pradhan said in a Friday tweet.



Pradhan also said he spoke earlier this week with another OPEC titan, the UAE, who assured India that it would continue to supply oil uninterrupted despite disruptions in the Strait of Hormuz, according to Live Mint.High oil prices have been a pervasive concern for India, who indeed is sensitive to oil price fluctuations due to its serious oil addiction that has long been fed by favorable pricing and credit terms from Iran for its oil purchases.That India is calling on Saudi Arabia as the one who could potentially lessen the oil price blow is no surprise. Saudi Arabia has the most available capacity of all the OPEC members, although it has not yet responded to pleas for it to crank up the production.

Russia is willing to step in to help Iran export its oil while the Middle Eastern country is struggling to keep the oil flowing while pressured by sanctions levied by the United States.Iran’s budget counts on raking in around $30 billion from oil and gas condensate exports.



Iran was holding out hope that Europe would have its Instex European payment system in place that would allow Europe to continue purchasing Iranian oil, but the system is not yet running, leaving Iran in tight spot when it comes to getting its oil out of country.Russia, however, is happy to help, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said on Friday according to Reuters. It would also be willing to help with Iran’s banking sector as well, as Iran is finding it difficult to process payments.



The dynamic between the United States, Europe, Russia, and Iran is an interesting one, given the fact that some EU states have been irritated with the United States meddling in its affairs as it looks to purchase cheap Russian gas through the controversial Nord Stream 2 project. If Europe is unable to get its payment system off the ground, Russia could facilitate the transactions, making exports possible despite the sanctions. Russia may then find somewhat emboldened EU members who are willing to thumb their nose at the United States when it comes to Nord Stream 2.If Russia’s help is successful, Iran would be able to export substantial amounts of oil to Europe, Russia would be able to export more gas to the EU, and Europe would be able to purchase both low-cost oil and gas. The United States, on the other hand, would find it near impossible to restrict Iran’s oil exports to zero, and would find it tough going to put the kibosh on Nord Stream 2.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Norway Just Triggered An Offshore Wind Energy BoomOil Shoots Up As Iran Says ‘’It’s Ready For War’’Is Bakken Oil Production Set For An Unexpected Drop?

Canada’s Senate passed on Thursday two controversial bills restricting the movement of oil tankers off the northern coast of British Columbia and overhauling the assessment process for oil pipelines—bills which have pitted environmentalists and liberals against the oil industry and the neighboring oil-producing province of Alberta.In a very close 49-46 vote, the Senate passed the so-called Bill C-48 which “prohibits oil tankers that are carrying more than 12?500 metric tons of crude oil or persistent oil as cargo from stopping, or unloading crude oil or persistent oil, at ports or marine installations located along British Columbia’s north coast from the northern tip of Vancouver Island to the Alaska border.”Last month, Canada’s Senate Standing Committee on Transportation voted to defeat the Oil Tanker Moratorium Act that opponents of the bill view as damaging to Canada’s oil industry.



Alberta’s Premier Jason Kenny said that he was “Very disappointed that Bill C-48, the ban on Alberta energy exports, just narrowly passed in the Senate by a vote of 49-46.”“Thanks to Senators who voted against this prejudicial attack on one province, Alberta. We will challenge this bill in Court,” Kenney tweeted.Related: Norway Just Triggered An Offshore Wind Energy BoomIn another oil-related vote, Canada’s Senate also passed, by a 57-37 vote, a bill to change the federal environmental assessment process for major construction projects, including oil pipelines. Alberta and the Canadian oil industry are strongly opposed to the legislation, the so-called Bill C-69, saying that it would prevent major projects from obtaining the necessary approvals within reasonable deadlines.



“Now the Senate has given final approval to Bill C-69 by a vote of 57 to 37, stripped of the amendments put forward by the Government of Alberta and business groups. This means the No More Pipelines Law will become law. A bad day for our economy, and the Canadian federation,” Alberta’s Kenny said.The Senate approval of the two bills, to which Canada’s oil sector and oil-producing province Alberta strongly object, came during the same week in which Canada’s federal government gave the go-ahead to the controversial Trans Mountain oil pipeline expansion project that it bought from Kinder Morgan last year.

The asset management arm of UK’s insurer Legal & General will remove ExxonMobil from its Future World Funds as these are focused on clients with an interest in investing in environmental, social, and governance high scorers.Reuters reports, however, that Legal & General Investment Management, which manages some $1 trillion in assets, will keep Exxon in its other funds along with the other companies it will be dropping from the Future World Funds. It will express its dissatisfaction with the boards of these companies for failure to meet its requirements for environmental responsibility by voting against the chair.“In all other LGIM (non-Future World) funds that remain invested in those companies that have not met our criteria, we will vote against the election of the chair of the board,” said the head of LGIM’s Head of Sustainability and Responsible Investment Strategy, Meryam Omi.



“We can vote against the chair on any number of issues, so to do so because of a single issue such as climate change sends a powerful message to companies that they should be raising their standards in this area,” Omi also said.Exxon was singled out for failure to meet even the minimum requirements for sustainability. The company does not report emissions and has not put in place emission reduction targets despite shareholder pressure.LGIm is not alone in its efforts to force corporates to commit to greater environmental responsibility. Last week Bloomberg reported that a group of asset managers including HSBC Global Asset Management and Investec along with 85 other investors have stepped up pressure on large companies to commit to the emissions reporting standard compiled by the Carbon Disclosure Project, a UK non-profit focusing on corporate emissions reporting.

Several explosions and a huge fire rocked the largest oil refining complex on the Eastern seaboard in southwest Philadelphia early on Friday, with early reports saying there aren’t any people injured while the cause of the incident is yet unknown. The massive fire and the explosions that witnesses and nearby residents heard and saw rocked the Philadelphia Energy Solutions Refining Complex, which started its first refining operations back in 1870.Philadelphia Energy Solutions’ refinery complex has a total refining capacity of 335,000 bpd and is the largest such complex on the U.S. Eastern seaboard, according to PES’s website.



The fire erupted shortly before 4 a.m. local time with flames shooting in the sky, eyewitnesses told CBS Philly. Witnesses heard two or three explosions at the refinery complex, which shook homes in Philadelphia and as far as South Jersey, according to NBC Philadelphia.Firefighters have already contained the fire within the refinery complex, officials told NBC Philadelphia shortly before 6 a.m., while roads have been closed and city emergency services issued a shelter-in-place for the neighborhood around the refinery.No evacuations have been ordered.



The fire erupted at the Girard Point part of the refinery complex, NBC Philadelphia reported.According to deputy fire commissioner Craig Murphy, a vat of butane ignited and eventually exploded, NBC Philadelphia says. The fire spread through the pipes in the complex, causing a series of smaller explosions. One worker was at the site at the time of the explosion, but was far away enough to escape serious harm, Murphy told NBC Philadelphia.The fire that broke out on Friday morning is the second fire this month at the same refinery complex. On June 10, a fire broke out at the Philadelphia Energy Solutions Refining Complex, affecting the facility’s 50,000-bpd catalytic cracking unit, a source familiar with the refinery operations told Reuters.   By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Oil Shoots Up As Iran Says ‘’It’s Ready For War’’This Is How The U.S. Plans To Cripple Iran’s EconomyOil Spikes On Soaring U.S., Iran Tensions

Undaunted by the new push for a war on plastics in the face of environmental opposition, joint venture Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LP has made a bid for Nova Chemicals Corp for $15 billion, exclusive Reuters sources claimed on Thursday.Nova Chemicals Corporation, owned by UAE’s state-owned Abu Dhabi’s Mubadala Investment Co and located in Canada, is a plastics manufacturer, has annual sales of $3.8 billion as of 2017, according to its website, manufacturing ethylene, polyethylene, expandable polystyrene, and chemical co-products. Its expandable polystyrene segment (EPS) is used in plastic cups and containers—a particular sore spot for environmental activists that have singled out disposable foodservice items.



Mubadala Investment Co, according to Reuters sources, has been on the lookout for a buyer since the beginning of the year. Mubadala may get other offers for the plastics manufacturer as well.Chevron Phillips Chemical Company—a joint venture between Chevron and Phillips 66 headquartered in Texas—has production facilities in the United States, Singapore, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Belgium. If successful, Nova would be Chevron Phillips’ first move into Canada.



Sources in March had rumored that Mubadala Investment Co. was looking to dump Nova, and thought it was worth $10 billion or more, according to Arabian Business. It is thought that state-owned Mubadala is looking for cash to help the UAE diversify away from oil. While Nova, which Mubadala acquired in 2009, was profitable at the time, it was largely on the back of the success of North American shale.Despite the calls for a worldwide ban on plastics in general, plastics demand is expected to be robust, and Big Oil is undeterred and making its move into petrochemicals. Another large merger between Exxon and Sabic suggest that the trend is for a consolidation of smaller petrochemical companies into giant ones, as Big Oil fears environmental opposition to ICE engines more than it fears environmental opposition to plastics.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:New York On The Verge Of Passing Very Aggressive Clean Energy BillNorway Just Triggered An Offshore Wind Energy BoomOil Spikes On Soaring U.S., Iran Tensions

Republican lawmakers at the Oregon State Senate fled the state on Thursday to avoid being forced to vote on a climate bill that the Oregon House passed earlier this week in one of the strictest U.S. emission-capping efforts to tackle climate change.  On Monday, the Oregon House voted in favor of passing the so-called cap-and-trade bill, under which emission-intensive industries—including transportation, utilities, and manufacturing—would have caps on their greenhouse gas emissions and the major polluters would have to buy credits for every ton of their own greenhouse gas emissions. Oregon will be looking to lower its emissions to 80 percent below the 1990 level by 2050.After clearing the Oregon House, the bill is now one vote away from becoming law. But this vote is in the Oregon Senate, where Republican Senators threatened walkouts to prevent the vote from taking place.



Oregon Governor Kate Brown, a Democrat, issued a statement on Wednesday, saying, “I’m disappointed in the Senate Republicans’ indications of a walkout, which would silence their constituents while stifling democracy.”Governor Brown vowed to use all resources available as governor to ensure that a vote would take place, including by sending police to round up Republican lawmakers.  Related: A $1 Trillion Energy Opportunity The U.S. Can’t Afford To Miss“I am prepared to use all resources and tools available to me as Governor to ensure that Oregonians are being served by their leaders. I am in close communication with Oregon State Police and my office is making preparations for a special session to be held on July 2, 2019, in the event that the business of this state does not conclude by Sine Die. We will stay in Salem to work until our job is done,” Governor Brown said.



On Thursday morning, Republican Senator Cliff Bentz of Ontario told The Oregonian that “In a few moments, I will not be in Oregon.”Bentz met with Governor Brown’s staff on Wednesday trying to negotiate amendments to the climate bill, but the talks failed.The Republican Oregon Senators are worried that the bill would not protect “energy intensive, trade-exposed” companies in the state from having to pay higher costs due to the bill that would put them at a disadvantage against competition from China, for example, Senator Bentz told The Oregonian.  By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:New York On The Verge Of Passing Very Aggressive Clean Energy BillNorway Just Triggered An Offshore Wind Energy BoomOil Spikes On Soaring U.S., Iran Tensions

OPEC’s oil producers from the Persian Gulf are not in a rush to increase production in July despite the fact that the current agreement expires at the end of June and the cartel and allies will discuss their future oil policy in the first days of July.  The Gulf oil producers—Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE)—will keep their July production within the limits set by the current deal expiring in June, OPEC sources told Reuters on Thursday.The Saudis are pumping in June at around the same rate as in May, while their production in July will continue to comply with the current production cut deal, Reuters’ sources said.



OPEC’s de facto leader and largest producer Saudi Arabia pumped 9.69 million bpd in May, according to OPEC’s secondary sources, while under the deal, the cap for the Kingdom is 10.311 million bpd. Kuwait and the UAE also over-complied with their share of the cuts in May, though in much smaller proportions than the Saudis.Earlier this week, The Wall Street Journal reported that Saudi Arabia is cutting its oil production even deeper this month as concerns over oil demand growth have intensified. The Saudis are also asking other producers to follow and restrain production, OPEC officials told The Journal.  While the Gulf producers Kuwait and the UAE will follow the Saudi’s lead, the biggest unknown at the OPEC+ meetings rescheduled for July 1-2 is whether non-OPEC Russia will continue to play ball and agree to roll over the cuts.



“Russia is the only country that is yet to decide,” an OPEC source told Reuters today, confirming comments from Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih from earlier this month that “a rollover is almost in the bag” for OPEC, but the cartel has yet to discuss the pact with the non-OPEC producers led by Russia.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Is Bakken Oil Production Set For An Unexpected Drop?The Oil Company Investors Fear MostHow To Buy Gold For $3 An Ounce

India and Russia continue to bolster their energy cooperation, and now India is looking at ways to establish oil shipping routes from Russia’s Far East India’s east coast, India’s Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said after a meeting with Yury Trutnev, Russia’s Deputy Prime Minister and the Russian president’s top envoy to Russia’s Far East.During the meeting, India and Russia discussed the opening of “new frontiers of co-operation” between India and Russia’s Far East, especially in the oil and gas sector, Pradhan tweeted.“We had substantive discussions on new opportunities for energy sector emerging from establishment of shipping routes from Far Eastern Russia to east coast of India,” the minister added.India also invited Russian companies to invest in future city gas networks across the country and expressed India’s interest in boosting its oil and gas investments in Russia, including in the Far East, Pradhan said.



India, which relies on imports to meet 80 percent of its oil demand, started last year to seek increased cooperation with Russia in the oil and gas sector.Russia, as one of the world’s largest oil and natural gas producers could become an important source to meet India’s energy needs, Pradhan said last September.India buys a large part of its crude oil from OPEC’s Middle Eastern producers—Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the UAE, and until recently—Iran, but has now suspended Iranian oil imports after the U.S. ended all waivers for Iranian customers. India was Iran’s number-two oil buyer after China.Following a summit last October, India said that it is further boosting its energy ties with Russia by pledging to cooperate in oil field development and liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects in Russia, including in the Arctic shelf.



Some of the recent deals between Indian and Russian companies include Russia’s oil giant Rosneft selling 15 percent in Vankorneft to India’s ONGC Videsh for US$1.27 billion in 2016.Rosneft, for its part, bought in 2017 49 percent of India’s Essar Oil Limited, now renamed to Nayara Energy.

London will hold its biggest car-free day event in September in a bid to encourage people to walk, cycle, and use public transport as the UK capital fights air pollution.London’s Mayor Sadiq Khan announced on Thursday that the biggest car-free day event in the city so far will be held on Sunday, September 22.The event will close to autos 20 kilometers (12 miles) of roads around Tower Bridge, London Bridge, and the City of London and is part of the mayor’s work to encourage Londoners and visitors to cycle, walk, and use public transport to help curb air pollution by reducing car emissions, the office of the Mayor of London said in a statement today.



According to the mayor’s office, two million Londoners—out of a population of more than 8 million—live in areas that exceed legal limits for nitrogen dioxide (NO2), including more than 400,000 children under the age of 18.According to the mayor’s office and to Transport for London (TfL), the local government body responsible for the transport system in Greater London, more than 50 percent of the toxic air in London is due to pollution coming from vehicles.“Almost half of Londoners think that road vehicles are not the main cause of air pollution. In fact, driving polluting vehicles is the single biggest cause, contributing to around half of London’s air pollution,” the authorities say.



Yet, three out of four Londoners are worried about the impact of air pollution on their health. Moreover, more than half of Londoners think you can always see when pollution is bad, while actually many pollutants are invisible to the naked eye and can be present in air that looks ‘clean’.London’s efforts to tackle air pollution come as a panel urged the UK government last month to urgently adopt new policies for anything from eating habits to energy consumption to avert the worst effects of climate change.  By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:The Oil Company Investors Fear MostHow To Buy Gold For $3 An OunceGlobal Oil Market Surprisingly Oversupplied

Iran has said its Revolutionary Guard had shot down a U.S. drone flying over Iranian territory, days after the U.S. accused Iran of shooting down a drone that was flying to the Gulf of Oman following reports of attacks on two tankers.The Independent reports the U.S. central military command had denied there being a drone over Iranian territory at the time. The Associated Press says the Pentagon declined to comment on the news.



This is the latest step in a dance of escalation between the United States and Iran that started gathering pace in late May, after four tankers were allegedly attacked off the coast of the UAE. The U.S. blamed Iran for that attack and Iran denied involvement. An investigation by the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Norway concluded the party behind the attack was “a state actor” which remained unnamed.Then came another attack, on two tankers this time, in the Gulf of Oman. Once again, the U.S. placed the blame on Iran, releasing video and images that the Pentagon claimed showed the Iranian Revolutionary Guard in implicating action. Iran has once again denied the accusations.



While the incidents and the heightened tension between Washington and Tehran failed to have much of an effect on oil prices, this could change. Since these happened near the world’s most important oil flow chokepoint, the Strait of Hormuz, they could have a lasting impact on the price of oil as ship owners, marine brokers, insurers, and reinsurers are already lifting premiums for insuring tankers passing through the region and are charging higher freight rates for shipping oil out of the Middle East.In the meantime, President Trump surprisingly downplayed the significance of the latest tanker attacks calling it “minor”. However, he said in an interview with Time, the U.S. will be sending more troops to the Middle East, adding that if Iran began to enrich uranium, a military confrontation would be a possibility.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Oil Markets Ignore A World On The Brink Of WarNorwegian Oil Pioneer: Big Oil’s Exodus Has StartedAre Oil Markets At A Turning Point?

The Environmental Protection Agency has officially repealed and replaced the never-implemented Obama-era Clean Power Plan (CPP) on Wednesday, according to the Wall Street Journal, in a move that is largely seen as a lifeline to the precarious coal industry that has been pressured both by cheap natural gas and environmental pushback.The new plan seeks to regulate each power plant on a case-by-case basis, instead of holding the entire industry to a single standard. It would give power plants more time to decrease emissions while continuing to operate.



The repeal of Obama’s Clean Power Plan is another campaign promise made by President Donald Trump in an effort to throw his support toward the coal industry, and it’s an important one. Obama’s CPP would have resulted in a number of coal plants shutting down, and could have essentially overhauled the entire energy sector. The CPP was stayed by the Supreme Court.“Under the CPP, the EPA Obama administration went beyond implementing best technology,” a senior EPA official said on a call with reporters on Wednesday, according to The Hill, adding that the CPP imposed emission reductions beyond what it had the authority to do. The Trump administration has long held that not only did the EPA overreach in this case, that it picked winners and losers in the industry.



The rollback of the emission regulations could mean that individual coal plants could increase emissions, but the EPA stated that overall emissions would still drop over time.The new rule, which critics say is a step backward and doesn’t go far enough to curb emissions, essentially gives states three years to come up with a plan to curb emissions standards, with an extra year for the EPA to review those plans.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Norwegian Oil Pioneer: Big Oil’s Exodus Has StartedOil Prices Jump On Hopes Of End To U.S.-China Trade WarOil Markets Ignore A World On The Brink Of War

Tesla hasn’t met Elon Musk’s goal of consistently manufacturing 1,000 Model 3s a day this quarter so that it can beat its sales and delivery record as Musk urged employees to do in May, Business Insider reports, citing leaked documents it has viewed.  At the end of May, a leaked email reportedly sent by Elon Musk to Tesla employees suggested that the electric vehicle maker had a good chance of making Q2 the highest deliveries and sales quarter in its history.An email believed to be sent to all Tesla employees by Musk on May 22 appeared on message boards, after a growing number of investment banks and analysts outlined ‘bear-case’ scenarios for the EV maker.  The May 22 ‘leaked’ email read:



“As of yesterday we had over 50,000 net new orders for this quarter. Based on current trends, we have a good chance of exceeding the record 90,700 deliveries of Q4 last year and making this the highest deliveries/sales quarter in Tesla history!”However, the email believed to be sent by Musk also said that Tesla needs sustained production of 1,000 Model 3s every day in order to beat the previous record, while its production rate has averaged 900 Model 3s in the third week of May, “so we’re only about 10% away from 7,000/week.”According to leaked documents with Tesla’s daily production for one segment of Model 3 at the Fremont factory, the carmaker’s production hit 1,000 units per day on just one day since Musk said in the email in May that this should be the target to beat the sales record, according to Business Insider. After May 22, Tesla’s average production for the Model 3 segment has been some 700 units per day.  Related: Oil Markets Ignore A World On The Brink Of WarAt Tesla’s annual shareholders’ meeting last week, Musk said:



“We have a decent shot at a record quarter on every level.

The Indian state of Maharashtra has identified a new location where India, in partnership with the state oil companies of Saudi Arabia and the UAE, plans to build a giant US$44-billion refinery, the chief minister of Maharashtra state, Devendra Fadnavis, said on Wednesday.  In June last year, Saudi Aramco and the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) signed a framework agreement and a memorandum of understanding with a consortium of Indian national oil companies to join the mega project in the Maharashtra state on India’s west coast. Saudi Aramco and ADNOC will jointly own 50 percent of the new joint venture company RRPCL, while the other 50 percent will be held by the Indian consortium. The parties agreed to explore a strategic partnership and co-investment in the development of the US$44 billion mega refinery.  By investing in the giant Indian refinery, the national oil companies of leading OPEC producers Saudi Arabia and the UAE would secure off-take for their crude in a strategic fast-growing oil market in Asia. 



However, the process of land acquisition for the new giant complex was put on hold late last year due to strong opposition from local farmers at the initially identified location. Farmers opposed the choice for the giant refinery because many of them depend on their land for their income and livelihoods.After the suspension of the land acquisition at the previous site, Fadnavis announced in February this year that the refinery would be relocated to another site, without specifying it.Related: China’s ‘Elon Musk’ Sees Big Future For Hydrogen CarsNow the Maharashtra state has picked the new location, in the Raigad district, some 62 miles (100 kilometers) south of Mumbai, Reuters quoted Fadnavis as saying in a written reply to lawmakers in Maharashtra state.



The previously proposed site at Nanar lies around 248 miles (400 kilometers) south of Mumbai.A state-run City and Industrial Development Corporation plans to buy land from around 40 villages in the Raigad district for the refinery, Fadnavis told lawmakers, as carried by Reuters.   Alongside investment in the mega refinery, Saudi Arabia has recently pledged to invest US$100 billion in India’s energy sector in its continued efforts to lock in future demand for its oil on the fastest-growing Asian markets.

Fragments of a limpet mine and a magnet which the U.S. Navy has removed from one of the oil tankers hit in the Gulf of Oman last week bear a striking resemblance to Iranian mines, a U.S. Navy commander said on Wednesday, showing the fragments to reporters at a briefing near the UAE port of Fujairah.“The limpet mine that was used in the attack is distinguishable and also strikingly bearing a resemblance to Iranian mines that have already been publicly displayed in Iranian military parades,” Reuters quoted Commander Sean Kido, commanding officer of an explosive ordinance dive and salvage task group in the Naval Forces Central Command (NAVCENT), as saying today.Commander Kido also disputed the account of the Japanese company owner of the Kokuka Courageous tanker that it had been struck by two “flying objects.”



“The damage at the blast hole is consistent with a limpet mine attack, it is not consistent with an external flying object striking the ship,” Commander Kido said.The U.S Navy is the latest official U.S. government representative to say that Iran was responsible for the attacks on the two oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman last week.U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and U.S. President Donald Trump also said that Iran was behind the attacks.



On the day after the attacks, CENTCOM said that the U.S. had video proof that Iran was behind the explosions that rocked the two tankers near the world’s most important oil chokepoint, the Strait of Hormuz.U.S. Central Command spokesman Bill Urban late on Thursday released a video saying the footage showed a patrol boat of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard approaching one of the tankers where it “was observed and recorded removing (an) unexploded limpet mine from the M/T Kokuka Courageous.”Tehran has denied the allegations, calling them “unfounded”, with one senior government official telling the BBC that Iran had no connection to the explosions.    By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:China’s ‘Elon Musk’ Sees Big Future For Hydrogen CarsBullish EIA Data Pushes Oil Prices HigherOil Markets Ignore A World On The Brink Of War

The federal government of Canada has approved the controversial Trans Mountain oil pipeline expansion project that it bought from Kinder Morgan last year. The project will triple the pipeline’s capacity to 890,000 bpd and this has sparked the outrage of the British Columbian government and a series of moves aimed at stopping the project.Alberta’s energy industry had reason to rejoice, but it will probably not rush into it. As the Edmonton Journal quoted Premier Jason Kenny as saying, “(This) isn’t a victory to celebrate, it’s just another step in a process that has, frankly, taken too long. We’ll measure success not by today’s decision, but by the beginning of actual construction and, more importantly, by completion of the pipeline.”Indeed, there are still obstacles to overcome. The latest came in the form of a bill that the Senate earlier this month voted: it upholds a ban on oil tankers in British Columbia’s northern coast. There is concern that this ban would render the expansion of Trans Mountain pretty much pointless, especially as it combines with B.C.’s relentless opposition to the project and increased tanker traffic off its coast.



The province in May lost a case at the B.C. Appeals Court where it sought to stop the expansion by claiming rights to determine the amount of oil that flows across its territory. B.C. is appealing the ruling at the Supreme Court.""We believe we have the right and authority constitutionally to regulate harmful substances through B.C., however they get here,"" B. C. attorney general David Eby said at the time.It was this opposition and the stumbling blocks that B.C. put on the path of the project that made Kinder Morgan drop it after a series of delays last year. The federal government’s purchase of the project caused an outcry in anti-pipeline circles, with some arguing that Ottawa had overpaid for the whole thing.



Now it’s up to the Supreme Court to decide the fate of the project and the new energy regulator that will replace the National Energy Bureau to make sure it complies with all environmental requirements that may well multiply as legislators seek to sever the ties between the NEB and the energy industry that they say compromised the impartiality of the regulatory body.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:The Oil Company Investors Fear MostU.S. Oil Sanctions Trigger Recession In IranAre Oil Markets At A Turning Point?

In what is the first confirmed strike against a foreign-owned oil asset, Libya’s National Oil Corporation said a warehouse in Tripoli that it owns jointly with Italian Eni was hit after an air strike.Reuters quoted NOC’s chairman Mustafa Sanalla as saying, “We are witnessing the destruction of the corporation’s facilities before our eyes,” adding that the material losses from the strike were significant.The air strike comes as Khalifa Haftar’s Libyan National Army continues its offense on Tripoli, currently held by the UN-recognized Government of National Accord.



Continued clashes in Libya and an escalation of hostilities could threaten the oil production of Wintershall Dea in the North African country, Mario Mehren, the chief executive of the European oil and gas group, recently told Russian agency TASS in an interview, echoing analyst comments that Libya could be the next sudden supply outage on the global market.  While oil traders have more or less gotten used to news about production outages in the North African country, these have been temporary, with the longest lasting about three months before restart. Now, with all eyes on the Middle East and Venezuela, and on U.S.-Chinese trade talks, analysts seem to have missed the growing risks for oil production from the continued fighting in Libya.The security situation in Libya has materially worsened since this spring after eastern strongman General Khalifa Haftar ordered in early April his LNA to march on the capital Tripoli. The self-styled army has been clashing with troops of the UN-backed government in a renewed confrontation.



NOC started to warn as early as in April that hostilities could threaten production, and this time, the situation could be worse than at the start of the civil war in 2011. The threat is rising at a time when NOC is making progress towards recovering Libya’s oil production after a slump following the civil war. Without the outages, the country produces about 1 million bpd.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:The Top 50 Oil & Gas Companies Of 2019Tanker Attacks Could Have A Lasting Effect On Oil PricesTrade Deal Could Lead To U.S. LNG Breakthrough

“Massive disruptions” could be seen in the crude oil trade in the Middle East, particularly in the Strait of Hormuz, according to a new report from IHS Markit.Spot rates in the Gulf have increased dramatically after the most recent attack on two tankers in the Gulf of Oman last week, according to IHS Markit. A VLCC—capable of carrying 2 million barrels of crude oil—now commands US$15,000 to move crude from the Middle East Gulf to China—a more than US$4,000 increase from just days before the attacks. The July contract rate is even higher at US$25,000 per day.


Higher insurance rates are partially to blame for the increased fees, as are higher bunker fuel prices in the Middle East region. What’s more, vessel availability near the Gulf is expected to fall over the next couple of weeks, HIS Markit said, as ship owners are likely to avoid the risker area that has seen more than one attack in recent weeks.The reduced tanker traffic in the area as a result of increased costs and higher risk may further eat into Iran’s oil exports, which have been steadily dropping since the United States levied sanctions on Iran and most recently, since the United States failed to extend the waivers to some of Iran’s biggest buyers of its crude.China, IHS Markit said last week, was Iran’s last hope, with the fate of Iran’s oil industry clearly in the Asian country’s hands. China’s crude oil imports from Iran dropped in May, while its state-owned refineries go offline for regularly scheduled maintenance.



Clarksons Platou Securities today reported that VLCC rates as of today averaged US$22,100 per day, Freight Waves said, adding that that was a 63% increase week on week.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Why The Oklahoma Shale Boom Isn’t Taking OffTanker Strikes Spell Doomsday Scenario For OPECEnergy Majors Face Off To Get A Piece Of This $40 Billion Deal

Just as the International Energy Agency (IEA) touts the benefits of scaling up hydrogen production and energy use, scientists are developing various technologies to find a cheap, eco-friendly, and feasible way to produce hydrogen—out of thin air and sunlight.The IEA published on Friday a report, saying that “Hydrogen can help to tackle various critical energy challenges, including helping to store the variable output from renewables like solar PV and wind to better match demand. It offers ways to decarbonise a range of sectors – including long-haul transport, chemicals, and iron and steel – where it is proving difficult to meaningfully reduce emissions.”However, the IEA noted that the widespread use of hydrogen faces several challenges currently, including expensive production, insufficient hydrogen infrastructure, and the fact that hydrogen today is almost entirely supplied from fossil fuels—natural gas and coal.



Just as the IEA released its report, researchers from ETH Zurich said last week that they had developed a novel technology to produce liquid hydrocarbon fuels exclusively from sunlight and air, thanks to a solar mini-refinery.“This plant proves that carbon-neutral hydrocarbon fuels can be made from sunlight and air under real field conditions,” Aldo Steinfeld, Professor of Renewable Energy Carriers at ETH Zurich, said.Earlier this year, the Dutch Institute for Fundamental Energy Research (DIFFER), in association with Toyota Motor Europe, started a partnership to develop a way to directly produce hydrogen out of humid air with a device that absorbs water vapor, and splits it into hydrogen and oxygen directly using the sun’s energy.



In Belgium, bioscience engineers at KU Leuven said in February that they had created a hydrogen panel that produces hydrogen gas from moisture in the air.According to the researchers and scientists at Leuven, twenty of these hydrogen panels could provide electricity and heat for one family for an entire winter.“Most hydrogen gas is produced using oil and gas – not a big win for the climate or the environment. We believe this is about to change,” the KU Leuven scientists say.  By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:The Oil Price Risk Analysts Are IgnoringDeclassified: The Sino-Russian Masterplan To End U.S. Dominance In Middle EastWhy The Oklahoma Shale Boom Isn’t Taking Off

China’s domestic wholesale gasoline and diesel prices have been falling amid weakening international crude and soft market fundamentals recently, and they tend to lose more ground as the glut for refined products grows worse in large parts of Asia.The prices of national standard 92-RON gasoline settled at CNY5,700-5,950/mt ($827-863/mt) in south, east and north China and Shandong on June 18, down by CNY400-600/mt or 6.45%-9.23% from May 31, JLC data shows. Meanwhile, diesel prices in these regions dropped to CNY5,800-6,000/mt, posting a loss of CNY200-350/mt or 3.28%-5.56%. Gasoline prices tumbled to below those of diesel, which has hardly been seen over the past years.Gasoline and diesel prices tracked softening international crude that has been hit by demand concerns amid an escalating trade war. They were also dampened by excess supply when demand was slow to grow.



Gasoline prices have dropped more than diesel this year, as the gasoline market sees an aggravating overhang amid slowing demand growth and rising production. China’s apparent consumption of gasoline amounted to 42.59 million mt in January-April 2019, a rise of 3.6% from the same period in 2018, according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). Growth slowed down by three percentage points year on year, which indicated decelerating demand growth because of falling car sales and negative impacts from alternative energy. The country’s car sales have been in a downtrend since 2018, while the sales of electric cars have been rising fast.The country’s gasoline production amounted to 59.19 million mt in January-May, a rise of 4.0% from the corresponding period in 2018, the NBS data indicates. In contrast, its diesel output slid by 7.6% to 67.74 million mt.Related: OPEC Aims For $60-$70 OilGasoline supply is expected to grow in H2 2019 as Hengli Petrochemical and Zhejiang Petrochemical begin gasoline and diesel production in new refineries, with both set to have a relatively high output ratio for gasoline.



Competition in the downstream sector is becoming increasingly fierce and retail margins are shrinking as petrol stations have been offering large discounts to boost sales. Petrol stations belonging to PetroChina and Sinopec started a new price war in Shandong, Henan, Hebei, Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Guangdong provinces in March 2019, offering discounts of CNY1-2/liter for gasoline and about CNY1/liter for diesel, and private petrol stations followed suit market sources said.The market is still strongly bearish and China is likely to cut fuel prices again next week. As of June 18, the fifth working day in this pricing cycle for China’s gasoline and diesel retail ceilings, the crude basket JLC selects to indicate fluctuations in international crude prices has dropped by 4.86% from the previous pricing cycle to $58.61/bbl, indicating a corresponding plunge of about CNY210/mt in the retail ceilings of gasoline and diesel, JLC data shows.By JLC InternationalMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Oil Prices Jump On Hopes Of End To U.S.-China Trade WarOPEC Aims For $60-$70 OilThe Oil Price Risk Analysts Are Ignoring

Just a week before OPEC and allies were set to meet in Vienna to discuss the fate of the production cut deal expiring in less than two weeks, participants are still debating when to hold the crucial talks, with OPEC discussing a proposal to delay the meeting to July 11 and 12, S&P Global Platts reported on Tuesday, citing two sources.  While OPEC and Russia have been busy trying to assure the markets that they would be working toward a solution to rebalance the oil market, reports started to emerge in the past few weeks that the parties can’t even agree on whether to hold the meeting as scheduled on June 25-26 or to push it into July.Reports have it that Russia has requested a delay of the June meeting into early July so that it would be held after the G20 summit in late June, while Iran, which is at odds with the Gulf Arab members of OPEC, has reportedly told the cartel that it wouldn’t agree to a postponement of the key meeting.



Khalid al-Falih, the energy minister of OPEC’s largest producer and de facto leader, Saudi Arabia, reiterated on Sunday his hope that the cartel would reach a deal to extend the cuts into the second half of the year at a meeting that will probably be held in the first week of July.Related: OPEC Aims For $60-$70 OilThe latest rumored meeting slot—July 11 and 12—would be a week later than what the Saudis hinted two days ago, but it would be okay for Iran, whose Oil Minister Bijan Zangeneh said on Monday that the Islamic Republic “would confirm rescheduling of the upcoming OPEC meeting only if it was to be held on July 10, 11 or 12 from originally June 25.”Zangeneh doesn’t want the date changed to July 3-4, as Russia had reportedly originally requested, because of scheduling conflicts.



According to an OPEC delegate who spoke to Bloomberg, the cartel proposed the July 10-12 dates to its members and would wait for their replies.Judging from the comments of various OPEC and non-OPEC officials and ministers and from reports from sources, the OPEC+ group won’t make a decision about the production cuts by the time those cuts expire at the end of June.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:The Top 50 Oil & Gas Companies Of 2019Declassified: The Sino-Russian Masterplan To End U.S. Dominance In Middle EastWhy The Oklahoma Shale Boom Isn’t Taking Off

Venezuela’s struggling oil company PDVSA plans to resume operations at its Isla refinery on Curacao, a company official who wished to remain unnamed told S&P Global Platts.The refinery has a nameplate capacity of 335,000 but its actual throughput is a maximum of 270,000-290,000 bpd. It is operated by a local company, Rafineria di Korsou, “under the direction of PDVSA,” according to the company official.The refinery has suffered its share of the fallout from the U.S. sanctions against Venezuela with scarcity of feedstock forcing all but the suspension of operations. This, in turn, has made the Curacao autonomous government, with which PDVSA has a contract for the operation of the refinery, to look for an alternative operator.



As a result of all this, Isla is facing bankruptcy: ""PDVSA will have to make the decision to send some 3 million barrels of crude to generate cash flow to cover expenses from September to December 2019 or send $60 million to honor the contract and avoid claims,” the company official told S&P Global Platts. ""If not, Isla will have to declare force majeure and bankruptcy. The refinery is now totally paralyzed. PDVSA promised the reactivation and offered to supply crude in July but through an intermediary.""The Isla refinery received an exemption from the January sanctions the U.S. slapped on Venezuela. Under the exemption, the refinery can continue working with U.S. companies until January 15, 2020 but it has not helped it much, it seems. On top of all its other troubles, it was also targeted by ConocoPhillips in an asset seizure move against PDVSA.The scenario with PDVSA sending crude for the refinery is the less likely one, as another company official explained. ""For PDVSA the refinery has a low priority. Crude production in Venezuela has decreased significantly. In this scenario, sending crude to Curacaco makes no sense, especially when you take in to account that PDVSA cannot sell products from Curacao because of the embargo.""



For Curacao, however, the refinery is high priority: it accounts for a tenth of the island’s GDP and a solid portion of its employment By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Why The Oklahoma Shale Boom Isn’t Taking OffDeclassified: The Sino-Russian Masterplan To End U.S. Dominance In Middle EastThe Oil Price Risk Analysts Are Ignoring

The Pentagon will send 1,000 additional U.S. troops to the Middle East on request from the Central Command for additional forces, Newsweek reports, citing a statement by the acting Secretary of Defense.""The recent Iranian attacks validate the reliable, credible intelligence we have received on hostile behavior by Iranian forces and their proxy groups that threaten United States personnel and interests across the region,"" the acting Secretary, Patrick Shanahan said. ""The United States does not seek conflict with Iran. The action today is being taken to ensure the safety and welfare of our military personnel working throughout the region and to protect our national interests.""



Meanwhile, the AP reports, the Pentagon also released a number of images that it says shows members of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard removing an unexploded mine from the side of one of the tankers that were attacked last week in the Gulf of Oman.Hours after the attacks, the U.S. released video footage that it said proved Iran was responsible for explosions. U.S. Central Command spokesman Bill Urban late on Thursday released a video saying the footage showed a patrol boat of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard approaching one of the tankers where it “was observed and recorded removing (an) unexploded limpet mine from the M/T Kokuka Courageous.”



Tehran has denied the allegations, calling them “unfounded”, with one senior government official telling the BBC that Iran had no connection to the explosions that pushed crude oil prices up by about US$3 per barrel.In a somewhat surprising turn of events yesterday, President Trump called the tanker attacks “very minor”. In an interview with Time magazine, Trump said “So far, it’s been very minor,” referring to the effect of the two recent attacks on tankers in the Middle East, both of which the Pentagon has blamed on Iran. However, the President said he would order military action against Iran if it tried to build a nuclear weapon.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Escalating Trade War Signals More Pain For OilClimate Change Could Trigger Global Financial CrisisDeclassified: The Sino-Russian Masterplan To End U.S. Dominance In Middle East

The frenzied Permania that had oil and gas companies rushing to the O&G hotspot may be on the outs, but production in the industry’s number one basin has not, according to the US Energy Information Administration’s Drilling Productivity Report released on Monday.Oil production in the Permian basin is set to hit a brand-new record next month, the EIA said, expecting a 55,000 barrel per day increase month on month, reaching 4.226 million barrels per day. The Niobrara and Bakken basins are also set for an increase in July, of 10,000 and 11,000 barrels per day, respectively. The Permian accounts for nearly half of the production of the top seven basins, and is nearly three times as prolific as the next most prolific basin, The Bakken.



For the seven major basins that the EIA tracks in its monthly Drilling Productivity Report, July’s production is set to increase by 70,000 month over month, reaching 8.520 million bpd—also a new record.This shale oil production has helped to catapult the United States into the top crude oil producer in the world at 12.6 million bpd as of the first week of June, even ahead of the titans of oil industry old—Russia, whose production hit 10.87 million bpd that same week; and Saudi Arabia, whose production hit 9.690 million bpd according to the last official OPEC MOMR.



While oil production is still on an uphill climb, the number of DUCs decreased in May, from 8,360 in April to 8,283 in May.Gas production in the seven most prolific shale plays is also expected to increase in July, from 80,564 million cubic feet per day in June to 81,362 million cubic feet per day in July.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Why The Oklahoma Shale Boom Isn’t Taking OffCheddar To The Rescue?

Iraq is looking to draft contingency plans in case the heightened tension in the Middle East results in some kind of blockade of Iraq’s oil exports through the Persian Gulf—a key lane for almost all of the exports of OPEC’s second-largest oil producer, oil ministry spokesman Assem Jihad told AFP on Monday.“There is no replacement for the southern port and our other alternatives are limited. It’s a source of anxiety for the global oil market,” Jihad told AFP on Monday.Tensions in the Gulf and in the Middle East have dramatically risen since Thursday, when two oil tankers were apparently attacked in the Gulf of Oman, just outside the Strait of Hormuz which connects the Persian Gulf with the Gulf of Oman and the open seas. The daily flows of oil through the Strait of Hormuz account for around 30 percent of all seaborne-traded crude oil and other liquids. Iran’s Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif tweeted early on Thursday that “Suspicious doesn’t begin to describe what likely transpired this morning,” referring to the attacks, while the United States directly blamed Iran for the attacks.



The Persian Gulf and then the Strait of Hormuz, which Iran has repeatedly threatened to block, are the key export routes of more than 3 million bpd of Iraqi crude oil from its southern ports lying on the Persian Gulf. According to officials who spoke to Reuters last month, Iraq’s exports from the Gulf ports averaged 3.454 million bpd in May.Cutting off Iraq’s crude oil exports would be disastrous for the country, which relies very much on oil revenues for its budget income, so the Persian Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz are the lifelines of Iraqi state revenues, industry analyst Ruba Husari told AFP.If Iran tried and closed the Strait of Hormuz, “it’s not going to be closed for long,” U.S. President Donald Trump told Fox & Friends in an interview on Friday, in which he also directly blamed Iran for Thursday’s attacks on the tankers in the Gulf of Oman.“We’re going to guarantee freedom of navigation throughout the straits,” U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Sunday.



Iran said on Monday that the Chief of Staff of the Iranian Armed Forces, Major General Mohammad Hossein Baqeri, “said his country is strong enough to act in broad daylight if it intends to stop the flow of oil exports from the Persian Gulf, rejecting accusations about Iran's involvement in the recent sabotage attacks on 2 oil tankers in the Sea of Oman.”“He added that the Iranian Armed Forces are at present monitoring the enemies' moves wisely, precisely and round the clock and will give a crushing and open response to any enemy move and in a very broad region,” Iran’s Fars news agency reports.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:A Watershed Moment For GazpromPompeo Makes Hard Claim: Strait Of Hormuz Will Remain OpenThe Top 50 Oil & Gas Companies Of 2019

Norway will be increasingly tempted to fund carbon emission cuts abroad instead of reining in its own greenhouse gas emissions in order to reach its ambitious 2030 climate goals, a member of the opposition Socialist Left party, SV, said on Monday.Norway has one of the world’s most ambitious net zero carbon goals—to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2030, which was enshrined into law in 2016, but which comes with the caveat that Norway can use the so-called carbon credits—financing greenhouse gas reductions in other countries—to offset its own emissions.According to Audun Lysbakken of the Socialist Left party in Norway and a former minister in a previous Labor government, “The closer we get to 2030, the more difficult it will be to reach our climate goals.”



“It will become more tempting to buy ourselves free of them,” Nina Berglund at newsinenglish.no quoted Lysbakken as saying on Monday.While Norway has ambitious climate goals, neither the Labor party—currently in opposition, nor the ruling Conservatives are inclined to limit Norway’s oil and gas production. Smaller parties who are part of the coalition governments of either Conservatives or Labor in recent years have called for the government to pay more attention to climate-related issues, but they have had to compromise on many occasions.Norway’s own domestic emissions are rising, the statistics office Statistics Norway said earlier this month. Greenhouse gas emissions increased by 0.4 percent in 2018 compared to 2017, according to Statistics Norway.



Emissions from oil and gas extraction jumped by 75.6 percent between 1990 and 2018, but over the past year emissions from oil and gas extraction dropped by 1.4 percent, according to the statistics which also showed that total energy supply emissions fell by 5.1 percent annually in  2018.On the day on which the debate over Norway’s emission goals and the ways to achieve them was rekindled, Norway’s oil and gas major Equinor said that it had made an oil and gas discovery in one exploration well in the Norwegian Sea.

Japan’s Inpex Corporation said on Monday that it had signed a heads of agreement with Indonesia’s government to develop a US$20-billion liquefied natural gas (LNG) project in Indonesia after changing the development plan—potentially reviving a project that has already faced years of delays.The Abadi LNG Project has been delayed by at least two years and the government of Indonesia has instructed the project developers to change their initial proposal for a floating LNG platform to onshore LNG development. Inpex Corporation is the operator and the majority holder with a 65-percent stake in the project, while a subsidiary of Shell owns the other 35 percent.As early as in March 2016, the Indonesian energy regulator said that Inpex would be delaying the final investment decision on the project until 2020, meaning that the project would not come online until 2026 at the earliest.



In March last year, Inpex said that it was about to begin pre-FEED work for the project and will draft a detailed revised plan of development after the authorities instructed the company in 2016 to change its plans from floating LNG platform to onshore LNG development.After discussions with the Indonesian government, Inpex signed today the heads of agreement with the endorsement of Shell after “the completion of Pre-FEED work on a revised POD to achieve an economically competitive project.”The Abadi project is expected to have annual production of 9.5 million tons of LNG and to cost between US$18 billion and US$20 billion, Indonesia’s energy ministry said.



The final investment decision for the Abadi project is expected in two or three years, with potential production start-up in the latter half of the 2020s, Bloomberg quoted INPEX’s president and chief executive Takayuki Ueda as telling reporters on Sunday.Last year, Inpex started production and exports from the US$40-bllion Ichthys LNG project offshore Western Australia, in which France’s major Total is a minority partner.  By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Why The Oklahoma Shale Boom Isn’t Taking OffTanker Strikes Spell Doomsday Scenario For OPECHow Iran Was Swindled Out Of $3.2 Trillion

It has been a while since the last assurance from a senior Saudi official that the initial public offering of oil giant Aramco is going ahead as planned, and this time the assurance comes from the top: Crown Prince Mohammed himself told Saudi daily Asharq Al Awsat that the IPO is on track for 2020 or 2021, depending on market conditions, The National reports. Ahead of that, in August this year, the company would hold its first earnings call.The listing of 5 percent in Aramco, which last year emerged as the world’s most profitable company booking US$111.1 billion in annual net earnings, is the foundation of the Crown Prince’s ambitious economic diversification program dubbed Vision 2030. While some have questioned the valuation of the company, its recent maiden international bond worth US$12 billion drew an estimated US$100 billion in investor interest.



The IPO, however, has been surrounded by problems, from the choice of venue for its international listing to its effect on its home exchange given the size of the company. At one point, the deal was said to have been shelved for the observable future because the market conditions were unfavorable but soon after Aramco’s chief executive said the listing would go ahead as planned, just a bit later.As part of the preparation for the listing of the century, Aramco acquired a majority stake in petrochemicals major Sabic to make itself even more appealing for investors. It was for this deal that it had to tap international bond markets: the price tag for the 70 percent in Sabic cost about US$70 billion.



Some observers of a more critical bend have noted that Riyadh is already spreading itself too thin, investing billions in various projects while Aramco is still 100-percent government owned. However, Crown prince Mohammed told Asharq Al Awsat that the Vision 2030 program has moved into the implementation stage.“Like any strategic plans, [Vision 2030] must be subject to updates and modifications according to circumstances and actualities that become evident upon application, without shaking the vision’s pillars and objectives,” Mohammed said.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Climate Change Could Trigger Global Financial CrisisThe No.1 Reason Why Investors Are Shunning Energy StocksShale Drillers Keep On Falling Into The Same Trap

Tesla’s third Gigafactory, one that will provide it with a way around Chinese tariffs on U.S. goods, is being built “at an incredible speed,” writes Electrek’s Fred Lambert.The Gigafactory 3 is located in Shanghai and it will be the first EV factory in China to be wholly owned by a foreign company. Getting it ready is crucial for Tesla as it seeks to expand into the world’s largest car market in general and the EV market in particular amid the continuing trade rout between Beijing and Washington. It is also Tesla’s first production facility outside the United States.



A wholly-owned production facility in the world’s top EV market will help the company compete on a more level playing field with a growing number of local EV manufacturers with an established presence. As a U.S.-made vehicle, Tesla’s cars in China have been subject to steep import tariffs, and sales have suffered from the U.S.-China trade war—a problem that the Shanghai factory will solve.Tesla broke ground on the facility this January and at the rate construction is going as per drone video coverage, it may be completed before the end of the summer. By the end of the year, Tesla plans to roll out some 3,000 cars weekly at the facility. This compares with about 7,000 cars at the original Gigafactory in Fremont.



In other news, Tesla is on track to sell a record number of cars this quarter, shipping some thousand vehicles daily on average since the start of June. The rush is prompted by the fact that EV incentives will be scaled back at the end of the month: from US$3,750 in federal tax credit to US$1,875.Yet while the electric vehicle credits are set to halve starting in July, lawmakers have proposed legislation to expand the credit called the Driving America Forward Act, which would grant each automaker $7,000 for another 400,000 autos sold. This could also affect sales negatively and prevent Tesla from beating its own car delivery record as buyers hold out for the bigger incentive if the legislation passes.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Escalating Trade War Signals More Pain For OilClimate Change Could Trigger Global Financial CrisisThe Top 50 Oil & Gas Companies Of 2019

The federal government of Canada is set to approve the highly controversial Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project this week, unnamed sources have told Reuters.The project, which would boost the current capacity of the Trans Mountain pipeline from Alberta to the coast of British Columbia three times, to 890,000 bpd, pitted against each other Canada’s oil heartland Alberta and neighbor B.C. whose government is strongly opposed to new oil projects.



Ottawa bought Trans Mountain Pipeline (TMP), the Trans Mountain Expansion Project (TMEP), and related assets for US$3.35 billion (C$4.4 billion) from Kinder Morgan, which was beginning to get exasperated with all the delays B.C. was putting in its way. The deal was pretty much as controversial as the project with certain groups, namely environmentalists, the British Columbian government and some First Nations. Other First Nations, however, continue to staunchly defend the project and its benefits for Alberta and even have plans to buy into it when Ottawa puts it up for sale, as was the original idea.Trans Mountain was the only new oil pipeline project the Liberal government of Justin Trudeau has approved, using the argument that Alberta’s rising oil production needs a bigger outlet to international markets. However, this support and the purchase of the project are unlikely to do the government any favors in the upcoming parliamentary vote later this year.



As Reuters notes, Trudeau came to power on the environmental wave, and with the exception of the Trans Mountain affair, he has been generally consistent in this respect. Now, if the government indeed approves the project, the energy lobby will be happy--but an important group of voters will not be: the green lobby.Unfortunately, Trudeau does not have a winning move: if the government for some reason rejects the project, the energy lobby would be alienated. If the election results in Alberta are any indication of popular sentiment, this decision could contribute to the Liberals losing the election in October.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads from Oilprice.com:Tanker Strikes Spell Doomsday Scenario For OPECHow Iran Was Swindled Out Of $3.2 TrillionPutin’s $40 Oil Lie

Tesla is well on its way to having a record sales quarter, and is currently delivering a thousand cars per day on average this month, Electrek reported on Friday, despite many missed deadlines and sales figures for previous quarters.The push comes US incentives for buying electric vehicles are set to drop again at the end of June. In order to break its record Tesla would need to ship 33,000 Teslas during the month of June in it's North American market.



Tesla is likely to reach that Target as it already has 7,000 cars on order to be delivered in the next 7 days-and Electrek expects there to be last minute orders as buyers of the EVs rush to get in under the wire before the $3,750 federal tax credit for the vehicles drops to just $1875. It's not just the sales order that needs to be placed by the end of the quarter to qualify for the current credit—delivery must be taken by the end of the month. The credits, which are likely responsible for a boost in last minute sales leading up to the credit deadline, are set to phase out completely by the end of the year.Buyers may have more confidence in buying a Tesla after it fared better than its peers when it comes to holding its value over time. While EVs are depreciating much faster than the average for all cars, one notable exception—Tesla--hold values better than their gas-powered rivals, according to automotive research firm and car search engine iSeeCars.com.



While the electric vehicle credits are set to halve starting in July, lawmakers have proposed legislation to expand the credit called the Driving America Forward Act, which would grant each automaker $7,000 for another 400,000 autos sold. It also may hurt current sales if potential buyers gamble and hold out for a bigger credit.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Escalating Trade War Signals More Pain For OilClimate Change Could Trigger Global Financial CrisisMiddle East Torpedo Attacks Send Oil Prices Soaring

Consumer prices in the San Diego area in California increased by 3.8 percent over the past 12 months to the end of May 2019, mainly due to the higher price of gasoline, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.In the two months ending May 2019, consumer prices in the San Diego area rose by 1.0 percent, chiefly influenced by higher prices for gasoline and household furnishings and operations, BLS’ Assistant Commissioner for Regional Operations, Richard Holden, said in the consumer price index report for the area this week.The energy index in the San Diego area jumped 11.4 percent for the two months ending in May 2019, largely driven by higher prices for gasoline which surged by 19.7 percent, the statistics showed. Prices for natural gas service decreased 7.4 percent, and prices for electricity declined 0.7 percent for the same period.  



Over the 12 months to May 2019, energy prices jumped by 5.5 percent, largely due to, again, higher prices for gasoline, which rose by 7.5 percent.California as a whole pays the highest price at the pump natiowide, at $3.838 per gallon as of June 14, according to AAA.At the start of May, gas prices in California averaged statewide more than $4 per gallon, while the national average was closing in on $3 a gallon. Gas prices rose in April and early May due to the rally in oil prices. In recent weeks, however, the price of crude oil on international markets has slumped by around $10 a barrel due to fears of slowing oil demand growth, leading to lower prices at the pump.



At the start of this week, nearly every state’s gas price average was cheaper than a week ago, a month ago, and a year ago, AAA said, expecting prices to further drop as the summer driving season begins.“Prices are dropping due to cheaper crude oil and at the same time U.S. supply is keeping pace with demand,” AAA spokesperson Jeanette Casselano said on Monday. “The national average is poised to fall to at least $2.70 this week – an indication that pump prices may be even cheaper this summer.”While right now even California motorists see some relief at the pump, they may feel some pain later in the summer as the state’s gas tax is set to increase by another 6 cents a gallon beginning July 1.  By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:This Overlooked Canadian Oil Niche Is Making Traders BillionsEscalating Trade War Signals More Pain For OilSmall Crude Build Sends Oil Lower

If Iran tried and closed the critical oil shipping lane in the Middle East, the Strait of Hormuz, “it’s not going to be closed for long,” U.S. President Donald Trump told Fox & Friends in an interview on Friday, in which he also directly blamed Iran for Thursday’s attacks on two tankers in the Gulf of Oman. On Thursday, two oil tankers were apparently attacked in the Gulf of Oman, just outside the Strait of Hormuz which connects the Persian Gulf with the Gulf of Oman and the open seas.

“It is the assessment of the U.S. government that Iran is responsible for today’s attacks in the Gulf of Oman. These attacks are a threat to international peace and security, a blatant assault on the freedom of navigation, and an unacceptable escalation of tension by Iran.”On Friday, President Trump told Fox & Friends “Iran did do it and you know they did it because you saw the boat,” pointing to a video released by the Pentagon showing what is believed to be an Iranian vessel removing an unexploded mine from one of the tankers hit yesterday.Related: The mine has “Iran written all over it,” President Trump said, adding that “We don't take it lightly,” referring to the attacks.



Iran denies involvement in the incidents, while its foreign minister Zarif said on Twitter that the U.S. “immediately jumped to make allegations against Iran—w/o a shred of factual or circumstantial evidence.”Meanwhile, Iran’s supreme leader said on Thursday “I don't consider Trump worth sending a message to, we won't negotiate with U.S.” Oil prices jumped on Thursday after news of the tanker attacks broke, but prices have been weighed down during the week by fears of slowing oil demand growth and rising U.S. inventories, and are on track for a weekly loss.

A Republican and a Democrat Senators from farm states have introduced a bill to tweak the biofuel waivers program and increase its transparency in a bid to help ethanol demand and producers who, they say, are currently disadvantaged at the expense of oil refiners who are being granted waivers from blending biofuels in gasoline.   Under the federal Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), oil refiners are required to blend growing amounts of renewable fuels into gasoline and diesel. Refiners that don’t have the infrastructure to blend biofuels must purchase tradeable blending credits known as Renewable Identification Numbers, or RINs. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has the authority to grant waivers from the RFS to refineries whose oil processing capacity is below 75,000 bpd and who can prove that blending biofuels would hurt them financially to an unsustainable level.This policy has long pitted the agriculture lobby against the oil refining lobby.



In a recent blow to the ethanol industry in the farming vs. oil refining battle, a federal appeals court has denied a renewable fuel group’s attempt to block the EPA from issuing small refinery exemptions (SREs) to the Renewable Fuel Standard.Now U.S. Senator Tammy Duckworth (D) of Illinois and Deb Fischer (R) of Nebraska said on Friday that they had introduced a bill that would require oil refiners to apply for waivers by June 1 in order to have their application processed in time and in a transparent manner for the next year. The bill also requires the EPA to report to lawmakers how it decides which refiner gets the so-called ‘hardship’ waiver from blending biofuels into gasoline.Related: Goldman: No One Knows What’s Going On In Oil Markets“Farmers across Illinois and throughout the Midwest are hurting and ethanol plants are idling while this administration is abusing the small refinery exemption program to undermine the bipartisan Renewable Fuel Standard,” Reuters quoted Senator Duckworth as saying in a statement.



Earlier this week, Duckworth and other Senators urged the Trump Administration and EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler in a letter to “stop abusing so-called ‘hardship’ waivers.”“The small refiner waiver provision was not intended to undermine the RFS to the benefit of the most profitable oil companies in the world. We request that you cease issuing any further small refinery exemptions, immediately reallocate the remaining gallons, and make public the information regarding any recipients of these exemptions,” the Senators wrote in the letter.  By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Oil Inches Higher On Falling Rig CountTanker Strikes Spell Doomsday Scenario For OPECU.S.: Video Proves Iran Was Behind Tanker Attacks

Workers at Brazilian state-held oil firm Petrobras joined on Friday a 24-hour nationwide strike in Brazil against proposed pension reforms that would raise the minimum retirement age and workers’ contributions, the United Federation of Oil Workers, FUP, said today.Petrobras workers are staging strikes at nine refineries across eight states in Brazil as well as the port terminal in Pernambuco, the umbrella trade union organization said.  Thousands of Brazilians are on strike today to protest the plans for a significant increase in retirement age, while various industry and services sectors are also using the nationwide strike to express grievances from their specific sector. For the oil workers, this is the privatization of assets of the state oil firm Petrobras, which the government and the company’s new management have been speeding up in recent months.



Workers in the union protest not only against the pension reform proposals, but also against the privatization of Petrobras assets, FUP says.At the beginning of this year, reports emerged that Brazil was pushing for major state-owned companies, including Petrobras, to privatize some subsidiaries as the Brazilian government of new far-right President Jair Bolsonaro looks to raise US$20 billion in state asset sales in 2019.“The privatization of the company is not in question. I do not have a mandate to think about it,” Petrobras’ new chief executive Roberto Castello Branco—who was tapped by Bolsonaro to lead the company—said in November.



Yet, the sale of non-core assets was expected to continue under Castello Branco, whose strategic vision for Petrobras includes “portfolio management, capital cost reduction, and relentless pursuit of cost reduction.”In late April, Petrobras approved the sale of several refineries as part of its divestment plan, and earlier this week, it struck a deal with the Brazilian antitrust regulator that will allow it to sell those downstream assets in a bid, the company said, to encourage greater competition in the industry.  By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Climate Change Could Trigger Global Financial CrisisThe No.1 Reason Why Investors Are Shunning Energy StocksShale Drillers Keep On Falling Into The Same Trap

Tesla is charging just over US$85,300 for its Solar Roof solution for a 9.45 kW system on a 1,862-square foot roof, Electrek reported on Friday, citing an actual Tesla quote sent to a client it has obtained.According to the Tesla quote that a reader from the Bay Area sent to Electrek, the solar roof on the 1,862-square foot roof would cost US$64,634, the Powerwall would add another US$10,050, and roof and site repairs would cost the customer an additional US$10,630.With the value of energy over 30 years at more than US$65,000 and the federal tax credit of over US$15,000, Tesla estimates that the net price of the Solar Roof for the client would be US$4,121 over 30 years.Despite the benefits and cost reduction over time, the initial investment in such a solution is quite steep, according to Electrek.  



On Thursday, Elon Musk tweeted that Tesla Solar Roof version 3.0 is starting early trials.At Tesla’s shareholders’ meeting earlier this week, Musk said that the version 3 of the solar roof will be one of “the cheapest roofs available.”“So you can have a great roof with better economics than a normal fairly cheap roof and your utility bill,” Electrek quoting Musk as saying.The high upfront price of Tesla’s solar roof solution could be one of the reasons why the company is struggling on the U.S. market.Related: Tanker Strikes Spell Doomsday Scenario For OPEC



Last month a Reuters report said that most of the solar cells made at Tesla’s solar factory in Buffalo, New York, are being exported instead of being installed on U.S. homes as originally planned, as Tesla continues to struggle on the American solar market.  esla entered the solar power business with the acquisition of SolarCity in 2016, sparking concern among investors and industry observers that it was stretching itself too thin.  Tesla’s solar sales slumped by 36 percent quarterly and by 38 percent annually in Q1 2019, according to the company’s Q1 update.In April, Tesla was said to be cutting the prices of its solar panels by as much as 38 percent below the national average in a bid to regain ground in the solar market.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Analysts: 2019 Oil Demand Growth Could Be Lowest In YearsHow Iran Was Swindled Out Of $3.2 TrillionPutin’s $40 Oil Lie

OPEC and its partners should start increasing oil production to keep the market well supplied and prices reasonable, Gazprom Neft’s chairman Alexander Dyukov said, as quoted by Reuters. Dyukov’s statement echoes Moscow’s reluctance to agree to an extension to the cuts proposed by Saudi Arabia earlier.Dyukov said a price range of between US$55 and US$65 per barrel was “acceptable” for Russian oil producers, adding that Gazprom Neft would be able to quickly step up production once the cuts are eliminated.These remarks are in tune with some made earlier this month by Russia’s President Vladimir Putin, who told media that Russia is comfortable with lower oil prices than Saudi Arabia. They are also in tune with a comment by Rosneft’s Igor Sechin, who said the cuts affected Russian companies’ market share in favor of U.S. producers.



“Does it make sense (for Russia) to reduce (oil output) if the U.S immediately takes (our) market share?” Sechin said. “We have to defend our market share.” The executive went on to say Rosneft would demand compensation from the Russian government if the cuts were extended.As the date of the next OPEC+ meeting in early July approaches, we’ll probably hear more remarks like this. Russian producers never really go on board with the cuts and it was only the large-scale contamination of the oil flow along the Druzhba pipeline into Europe that forced them to shrink production enough to fall within the quota agreed with OPEC.At the same time, chances are the higher-price camp will also step up its efforts to convince everyone the cuts will do them good: the latest sign in this direction was how oil prices behaved after the news broke of new tanker attacks in the Gulf of Oman. Although they jumped by about US$3 initially, prices started retreating on the same day.

An auction to pick foreign partners for Mexican state energy giant Pemex scheduled for October has been canceled by the country’s energy regulator, Reuters reported, noting the official information confirmed what two unnamed sources has said earlier.The auction was planned to provide Pemex with partners for the development of seven onshore oil and gas blocks and was already postponed twice since 2018 amid a change of government that pledged to reverse many of the energy policies of the previous administration.One of these, the open tender of oil and gas prospects to international oil companies, has already been suspended until the government completes a review of all existing contracts with foreign oil and gas E&Ps for evidence of corruption.



Pemex, meanwhile, has been struggling to reverse a steady decline in production, which was the main reason why the previous administration opened up Mexico’s oil and gas industry to international companies. This administration, too, has ambitions in this respect despite the different approach: the Obrador government has prioritized an increase in local oil and gas output and has been generous with Pemex to help it turn things around.President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised that by the end of his term in office, Mexico will produce almost 2.5 million bpd of crude – a level close to the 2013 average of 2.522 million bpd.Related:  Analysts: 2019 Oil Demand Growth Could Be Lowest In YearsAs part of the production decline reversal plan, Pemex also increased its spending plans for this year. In December, the company said it had budgeted US$23 billion for 2019, up by 15 percent on 2018. Half of the total will be directed towards exploration and production, with some onshore deposits also benefitting from the investment alongside shallow-water blocks. 



While the exact reason for the cancelation of the tender was not divulged, the move is the latest sign of the current government’s departure from the previous one’s approach to energy reform. The Obrador government has expressed preference for service contracts between Pemex and other companies rather than the farm-outs preferred by the Pena-Nieto administration. Still, even those seem to be hard to come by right now.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Tanker Strikes Spell Doomsday Scenario For OPECPutin’s $40 Oil LieHow Iran Was Swindled Out Of $3.2 Trillion

Libya’s internationally recognized National Oil Corporation (NOC) said on Thursday that it is concerned about an increased military presence inside one of the country’s key oil terminals, Ras Lanuf, warning that the facility could become a military target, putting at risk its critical oil infrastructure.NOC’s warning is the latest sign that the ongoing fighting among forces loyal to the Tripoli-based UN-recognized government and a self-styled army of a military commander from the east could spill over to Libya’s oil sector and infrastructure, potentially leading to an oil supply outage from the North African OPEC member which pumps just over 1 million bpd at present.While the oil market is fixated on the U.S.-China trade war for signs of demand, and on Iran, Venezuela, and the Middle East for signs of more supply disruptions, investors have not fully priced in the increased risk that Libya’s fighting could result in a serious oil supply outage, analysts say.



The security situation in Libya has materially worsened after eastern strongman General Khalifa Haftar ordered in early April his Libyan National Army (LNA) to march on the capital Tripoli. The self-styled army has been clashing with troops of the UN-backed government in a renewed confrontation that could escalate and threaten to disrupt, once again, Libya’s oil production and exports.According to NOC’s press statement from Thursday, a group of around 80 military personnel under the command of Major General Abdullah Nur al-Din al-Hamali from LNA entered the port on June 5, commandeering one building and converting it to military use.Related: Russian Energy Minister: Oil Could Still Drop To $30“We cannot accept a situation where any party to the current conflict misuses oil facilities,” NOC chairman Mustafa Sanalla said.



“The presence of forces inside the terminal represents an unacceptable risk to employees. This renders the terminal a potential military target, thereby risking the destruction of Libyan oil infrastructure - and the resulting economic crisis that would follow,” he said, adding that if risk assessments show that continued military presence is a risk to employees, NOC will take steps to protect them, including by withdrawing them from the oil terminal.A spokesman for the LNA, however, denied that LNA forces are in the oil terminal’s facilities. “We expect every day a lie about the army (LNA),” the spokesman told Reuters.

Electric vehicles (EVs) are depreciating much faster than the average for all cars, with one notable exception—Tesla, whose vehicles hold values better than their gas-powered rivals.Automotive research firm and car search engine iSeeCars.com has examined the depreciation of EVs and found that the lightly-used electric cars—the average three-year-old used prices—in the EV segment depreciate on average 56.6 percent, compared to average depreciation of 38.2 percent for all vehicles.  “Categorically, electric vehicles depreciate more than the average vehicle because resale values take into account the $7,500 federal tax credit and other state and local credits that were applied to these vehicles when they were bought new,” iSeeCars CEO Phong Ly says.  



“Because the technology of EVs changes at a rapid pace, obsolescence also plays a role in their dramatic depreciation as well as consumer range anxiety and lack of public charging infrastructure,” according to Ly.The best bargains for those looking to buy a lightly used EV is Fiat 500e, which depreciates by 69.7 percent, followed by BMW i3, Nissan LEAF, Volkswagen e-Golf, and Ford Fusion Energi, according to an iSeeCars ranking.Separately, iSeeCars has found that used late-model versions of the Tesla Model S are in high demand compared to similar luxury cars, and that despite high average prices, the Model S sells faster than its competitors.



An Autolist.com study found last December that Tesla Model S and Model X hold their resale value better than any of their gas-powered peers, with the Model S value down on average by 27 percent after 50,000 miles, compared to an average of 36 percent in its segment, and the Model X value down by an average 23 percent, compared to 33 percent in its segment.Meanwhile, Tesla’s new vehicles sales in North America, its home market, reached an all-time high, according to a report by Electrek earlier this month, which cited exclusive information supplied by unnamed sources.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Platts: OPEC Oil Production Slumps With Saudis Cutting DeeperEscalating Trade War Signals More Pain For OilClimate Change Could Trigger Global Financial Crisis

Canada may have to raise its federal carbon tax if it wants to achieve its pledge under the Paris Agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, Canada’s Parliamentary Budget Officer (PBO), the federal budget watchdog, said in a report on Thursday.  Under the Paris Agreement, Canada has pledged to reduce its emissions by 30 percent below 2005 levels by 2030, to a level of 513 megatons (Mt) of CO2 equivalent.However, under current policies, Canada will have reduced its emissions from 704 Mt in 2016 to 592 Mt in 2030. This leaves a gap of 79 Mt to the 513 Mt target under the Paris Agreement under current policies and measures, PBO said in its report.



So the office estimates that an additional carbon price rising from US$4.51 (C$6) per ton in 2023 to US$39 (C$52) per ton in 2030 would be required to achieve Canada’s emissions target under the Paris Agreement, on top of the US$37.58 (C$50) per ton federal fuel charge that is scheduled to be in place in 2022. The Paris Agreement goals and the effects of climate change have become a hot topic in all developed economies in recent years.Last month, the Bank of Canada ranked for the first time climate change as a key weak spot in the Canadian financial system and economy, as a growing number of governments start to warn of the risks to the planet and economy that global warming brings.



While the budget office of Canada has calculated that the federal carbon tax may have to increase for meeting the Paris Agreement goals, nearly half of Canadians are opposed to the carbon tax, according to a poll by Forum Research earlier this month. Most of the respondents—two thirds— in a poll among 1,633 Canadian voters said that the carbon tax will affect their vote in the federal election in October, with Conservative voters opposing the tax more likely to be motivated to vote.Related: Climate Change Could Trigger Global Financial Crisis“The carbon tax looks like it’s mobilizing its opponents to vote in far greater numbers than its proponents,” said Dr. Lorne Bozinoff, President of Forum Research. “Additionally, Conservative supporters are far more opposed than Liberals are in favour. If the Conservatives can consolidate the opposition around this issue, and make it the focal point of the campaign, the Liberals’ re-election prospects may be severely diminished,” Bozinoff said.Meanwhile, the oil producing province of Alberta passed earlier this month legislation to repeal the provincial consumer carbon tax—a key campaign pledge of new Alberta Premier Jason Kenney.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Cheap Gas To Fuel New Global Demand BoomAn Opportunity In California’s Overlooked Oil SectorThe Bearish Threat Within OPEC

ExxonMobil and Saudi Arabia’s SABIC said on Thursday that they would proceed with a plan to build a US$10-billion petrochemical project in San Patricio County, Texas.Back in 2016, ExxonMobil and SABIC said that they were evaluating the potential to build a jointly operated petrochemical complex on the US Gulf Coast, and were assessing sites in either Texas or Louisiana.In May last year, the companies announced the creation of a joint venture, Gulf Coast Growth Ventures, for the construction of the plant in San Patricio County, Texas, which they had picked for the facility. 



The plant will include a 1.8 million metric ton ethane steam cracker, two polyethylene units, and a monoethylene glycol unit. The companies received this month the final environmental regulatory approval to build the facility. Construction is expected to start in the third quarter this year, with the plant start-up anticipated by 2022, Exxon said in a statement today.According to Exxon, the project will create more than 600 permanent jobs, while an additional 6,000 high-paying jobs will be created during the construction phase. The facility is expected to generate more than US$22 billion in economic output during construction and US$50 billion in economic benefits during the first six years of operation, Exxon said, quoting a preliminary independent study by Impact DataSource.“Building the world’s largest steam cracker, with state-of-the-art technology, on the doorstep of rapidly growing Permian production gives this project significant scale and feedstock advantages,” Darren W. Woods, chairman and chief executive officer of ExxonMobil, said.



“It is one of several key projects that provide the foundation for significantly increasing the company’s earnings potential,” Woods added.SABIC Vice Chairman and chief executive Yousef Al-Benyan said, commenting on the decision to proceed with the petrochemical facility:“With this project, we look forward to further building our business presence in the U.S. and serving the communities and customers in the North and South American markets even more effectively.”By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Platts: OPEC Oil Production Slumps With Saudis Cutting DeeperEscalating Trade War Signals More Pain For OilClimate Change Could Trigger Global Financial Crisis

UK energy provider SSE Plc said on Thursday that it is proposing to close its last coal-fired power plant in the country by March 2020, amid a national and international drive for lower-carbon sources of electricity generation.  SSE plans to shut down all remaining operational units its Fiddler’s Ferry Coal-Fired Power Station in Warrington, Cheshire, in northwest England. The company said in March this year that it would close one of those units, but now, after a comprehensive review, it proposes to close the whole coal-fired site by March 31, 2020.“As national and international policies focus on promoting lower-carbon forms of electricity generation in a bid to tackle climate change, the economics of coal-fired stations have become increasingly challenged. The UK has committed to ending unabated coal-fired electricity generation by 2025, and yesterday the Government confirmed it would legislate to achieve a net zero carbon emissions target by 2050,” SSE said in a statement.



In view of the policies and the focus on lower-carbon electricity sources, Fiddler’s Ferry economics have deteriorated to an unsustainable level, SSE said, adding that it would work to avoid compulsory redundancies of the 158 employees at the plant where possible.  Related: Escalating Trade War Signals More Pain For OilAs the UK aims to phase out coal by 2025, coal-fired electricity generation in the country has been at all-time lows in recent months. In the first week of May, the UK went coal-free for a full week since the 1880s, as its electricity generation used 0% coal-fired power. Natural gas delivered 46 percent of Britain’s electricity in that week, followed by nuclear and wind power, according to data from the National Grid ESO.Then later in May, Britain had a two-week coal-free run, beating the record from earlier that month.  



While the share of coal in electricity generation continues to shrink, the share of renewables continues to grow, according to UK government figures. In Q4 2018, the share of renewables rose to 37.1 percent, up by 7.0 percentage points from Q4 2017, thanks to higher capacity. On the other hand, the share of generation from fossil fuel sources fell, with coal’s share of generation at 5.7 percent, down by 3.4 percentage points from Q4 2017.  By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Climate Change Could Trigger Global Financial CrisisMiddle East Torpedo Attacks Send Oil Prices SoaringIs It Time For A Contrarian Bet On Oil?

The new conservative Alberta government has targeted media in a campaign aimed at improving the image of the oil sands industry as presented by Premier Jason Kenney.CBC News reports Energy Minister Sonya Savage had sent letters to Politico and National Geographic saying the Alberta government wanted to correct misinformation published by the two outlets regarding oil sands.In the letter to Politico, Savage referred to a story quoting a former U.S. ambassador to Canada as saying the U.S. no longer needed Canadian oil and went on to explain why this did not reflect the truth touching on the discrepancy between U.S. production and consumption and political instability in other oil-producing countries to distinguish Canada from them.



While it is unclear how Politico might have been at fault in quoting a government official, the letter to National Geographic is much harsher as are the cited inaccuracies. Among these is a statement that there are “175-odd” oil sands projects while in fact, Savage writes, there are only seven. According to JWN Energy author Deborah Jaremko, who debunked 12 inaccuracies in the national Geographic piece, “There are currently six operating oilsands mining projects, and 10 total mines operating within these projects. There are also 26 operating in situ, or drilled thermal projects.CBC notes that most Alberta oil sands projects are in-situ, meaning there is no open pit mining that requires tailing ponds to dump toxic chemicals used in the mining process. However, the author of the National Geographic article highlighted the issue of tailing ponds, saying there was “no end in sight and no solution to clean them up.” To this Savage responded with the fact that oil sands producers are required by law to reclaim sites after the end of their productive life.Related: Middle East Torpedo Attacks Send Oil Prices SoaringAnother piece of misinformation that was not included in the letter but was highlighted by CBC is the implication that oil sands projects are so massive they span the length of a highway in northern Alberta where the oil sands industry is concentrated.



The news agency said, citing Jaremko’s article, that “the highway all the way from Edmonton to the northernmost oilsands project, Fort Hills, measures less than 350 miles — slightly more than 550 km — and most of that roadway is lined by boreal forest, with the actual oilsands mining concentrated in a short stretch north of Fort McMurray.” And this is just one of a total dozen of inaccuracies spotted in the National Geographic story.Savage’s letter to National Geographic—which has to date amended its article twice—ended on a friendly note, inviting the news outlet to contact the Alberta government when it needs to and be provided with independently verifiable sources of information concerning the oil industry.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Escalating Trade War Signals More Pain For OilThe No.1 Reason Why Investors Are Shunning Energy StocksShale Drillers Keep On Falling Into The Same Trap

Rising shale oil production in the United States that drove gas flaring up 48 percent in 2018 also pushed up the global total by 3 percent to 145 billion cubic meters, the World Bank’s Global Gas Flaring Reduction partnership reported.The agency cited satellite imagery that showed the most active locations of gas flaring were concentrated in the Bakken shale play in North Dakota, and the Permian and the Eagle Ford formations in Texas and New Mexico. Oil production, the World Bank said, increased by as much as 40 percent in the Permian, 29 percent in the Bakken, and 15 percent in the Eagle Ford.



There was some good news, however, and it was that the intensity of gas flaring was low, at 0.3 cubic meters of gas per barrel of oil. This compares with as much as 2.9 cubic meters of gas per barrel of oil back in 2012 during the first shale revolution as the industry calls it.Earlier this month, Norway’s Rystad Energy said gas flaring in the Permian had hit an all-time high in the first quarter of this year but that was not so much because of production growth as it was a result of a pipeline shortage that prevented the utilization of the associated gas flowing from oil wells.



The annualized rate of gas flaring in the Permian came in at 6.8 billion cubic meters, which is theoretically enough to meet much of the gas demand of whole countries. Together with the Bakken, which is the other flaring hot spot in the United States, oil and gas producers waste so much of the commodity that it exceeds the annual gas demand of certain countries such as Israel, Hungary, and Romania.The consultancy said at the time there was little chance of this rate of gas flaring declining in any significant way through the rest of the year as additional pipeline capacity as well as gas storage is slow to come by.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Extreme Weather Could Send Global Energy Demand To Record HighThe Success Story Behind Tesla’s Tarnished ImageSmall Crude Build Sends Oil Lower

President Trump continued his relentless offense against Russian gas in Europe this week by threatening to slap sanctions on Germany for its equally relentless support of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project that will increase the flow of Russian gas into Europe.Bloomberg quoted the U.S. President as saying “We’re protecting Germany from Russia, and Russia is getting billions and billions of dollars in money from Germany,” during his meeting with his Polish counterpart Andrzej Duda in the White House.Threats of sanctions have come from Washington earlier as well, targeting European companies involved in the Nord Stream 2 project, including supermajor Shell, Austria’s OMV, and German Wintershall and Uniper, along with French Engie.



The U.S. argument is that an expansion of the existing Nord Stream pipeline would deepen Germany’s—and Europe’s—dependence on Russian gas at a time when they should be reducing this dependence and diversifying into other sources, including U.S. LNG. The German argument, on the other hand, is that there is a market for any gas as long as the price is right.Now, Reuters quoted Trump as saying the pipeline project would make Germany “a hostage of Russia if things ever happen that were bad.”In the past, Russia has suspended the flow of gas through Ukraine because of pricing disputes between the two that have dragged on for more than a decade now. There has not been a major disruption in the European supply of Russian gas but European officials are uncomfortable with the degree of dependency of the continent on Russian gas: Gazprom’s market share in Europe last year hit 35 percent.



In response to Trump’s statement, Bloomberg quoted Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov as saying it was “nothing other than blackmail and a form of unfair competition.”Earlier this month, Energy Secretary Perry, on a visit to Europe, said U.S. LNG was competitive to Russian pipeline supplies: “This idea that somehow ... LNG can’t compete with pipelined gas is just false,” Perry said on the sidelines of the conference, as the United States authorized additional volumes of LNG exports, calling its LNG “freedom gas.”By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Climate Change Could Trigger Global Financial CrisisMiddle East Torpedo Attacks Send Oil Prices SoaringSmall Crude Build Sends Oil Lower

Saudi Arabia’s state-run oil company Saudi Aramco has announced a new financial first for the giant: it will hold its very first earnings call in August revealing to the world its H1 2019 results, according to Arabian Business.Aramco first shed some light on a few of its financial figures that have been shrouded in secrecy forever. In January Aramco shared its independent audit results of its massive oil reserves. A few months later, Aramco shared its bond prospectus that revealed its staggering 2018 profit figure of $111 billion, making it the world’s most profitable firm—if the figure provided is accurate.Saudi Aramco’s privacy in relation to its financial information came to light when it announced it would publicly list a portion of its company on a stock exchange to be named later. However, the lack of transparency in its data has proven to be a solid stumbling block. The IPO was subsequently delayed, with some industry experts guessing that it would never happen at all.



The most recent information on the IPO came in March from Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih, who said that the IPO was on track to take place in 2021. The earnings call announcement may be another necessary step in the IPO process designed to appease the public.The international bond that Aramco offered earlier this year was a success despite the lack of the usual transparency with these deals.With or without the IPO, Aramco is moving towards being an international player, and improved transparency will be a must.



“We are no longer going to be inward-looking and focused only on monetising the kingdom’s resources. Going forward the world is going to be Saudi Aramco’s playground,” Al-Falih told the Financial Times in February. “If I have investors from New York or London or Tokyo that are investing in Saudi Aramco they want Saudi Aramco to be competing with the world’s best international oil companies,” Al-Falih also said at the time.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Can Trump Rely On The Saudis As Oil Prices Crash?OPEC’s Struggle To Avoid $40 OilThis Overlooked Canadian Oil Niche Is Making Traders Billions

Iran is considering revising its financial and budgetary policies to remove oil income from them as a means to “counter Washington’s economic sanctions that constitute a case of terrorism,” Iran’s Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said on Wednesday, as carried by the Iranian Fars news agency.Referring to the U.S. sanctions on its oil industry and exports as “economic terrorism,” Zarif said that “We will find ways for the welfare and comfort of our nation in these hard conditions, including revising the budget and financial policies to make them oil-free.”  “They have opened economic war on our nation and we are also facing the Americans’ propaganda and attempts to spread hatred,” Fars quoted Zarif as saying during a meeting with Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono as part of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s visit to Iran.  



Zarif’s words echo comments from Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani, who said on Wednesday: “There is no doubt that what the US has done against the Iranian nation is clear example of economic terrorism, and will be recorded in the history, but the Iranian nation have withstood these pressures,” according to the official website of the Iranian president.After the U.S. ended all sanction waivers for Iranian oil customers on May 2, Iran’s crude oil exports dropped significantly in May 2019 compared to April and plunged by more than 2 million bpd off their 2.5-million-bpd peak in April 2018, just before the U.S. withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal and moved to re-impose sanctions on Iran’s oil industry.According to industry sources and tanker-tracking data cited by Reuters, Iran’s oil exports in May plummeted to 400,000 bpd, which is less than half of Iranian oil exports in April.



Oil income is an essential part of Iran’s state revenues and the plunging crude exports are crippling the economy.According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Iran’s economy is expected to shrink by 6 percent this year, while the annual inflation will spike to 37.2 percent.  By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Extreme Weather Could Send Global Energy Demand To Record HighThe No.1 Reason Why Investors Are Shunning Energy StocksShale Drillers Keep On Falling Into The Same Trap

Oil trade and the U.S. sanctions on Iran’s oil industry will likely be part of the discussions that Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will hold with Iran’s officials on the first visit of a sitting Japanese premier to Iran since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.  U.S. ally Japan will officially mark 90 years of diplomatic relations with Iran. Some analysts see Japan’s Abe as a possible mediator in trying to de-escalate tensions between the United States and Iran, while Iran is reportedly hoping that the Japanese prime minister could mediate between Tehran and Washington for easing of the strict U.S. sanctions on Iranian oil exports that are crippling the Islamic Republic’s economy.Japan, which used to import roughly 5 percent of its oil from Iran in recent months, was one of the eight countries to which the U.S. had given special exemptions to continue buying Iranian oil for six months after the oil sanctions snapped back in November last year.



The United States, however, pursued a maximum pressure campaign against Iran and put an end to all sanction waivers for all Iranian oil buyers, beginning in May. Japan obliged and stopped importing oil from Iran. During the window of the sanction waivers between November and April, Japan imported oil from Iran only in February, March, and April this year, with April imports plunging 42 percent from March, to 169,100 bpd.Although Japanese refiners have stopped importing oil from Iran, they hope that Japan’s government could work toward a possible resumption.Related: Saudi Arabia Vows To Prevent Oil Crash“We hope (the Japanese government) will make strenuous efforts so imports can be resumed,” The Japan Times quoted Takashi Tsukioka, the head of the Petroleum Association of Japan, as saying at a recent press conference.



Meanwhile, a senior Iranian official tells Reuters that Iran would ask Japan to be the mediator of some kind of indirect dialogue to ease the U.S.-Iran tensions and ease the U.S. oil sanctions.“Japan can help in easing the ongoing tension between Iran and America... As a goodwill gesture, America should either lift the unjust oil sanctions or extend the waivers or suspend them,” the official told Reuters.  Analysts who spoke to the BBC say that the chances of Japan’s Abe to achieve anything as a mediator are close to zero, while Japanese officials have discouraged reporters and analysts from reading too much into the prime minister’s ‘mediator’ role.   By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:OPEC’s Struggle To Avoid $40 OilExtreme Weather Could Send Global Energy Demand To Record HighThe Success Story Behind Tesla’s Tarnished Image

Norway’s Parliament is expected to approve later on Wednesday plans by the government’s US$1-trillion fund—the world’s biggest sovereign wealth fund—to divest from oil and gas exploration companies in a landmark decision that could impact future investor attitude toward fossil fuels.After months of deliberations, Norway’s government proposed in March that the Government Pension Fund Global, as the so-called ‘oil fund’ is officially known, divest from 134 companies classified by the index provider FTSE Russell as belonging to the exploration and production subsector. As at the end of 2018, the Norwegian fund held stakes in E&P companies—under FTSE Russell’s classification for such—with an approximate value of US$7.6 billion (66 billion Norwegian crowns). This corresponds to 1.2 percent of the fund’s holdings in equities.The move by the fund, which has amassed its vast wealth on the back of Norway’s oil and gas revenues, comes at a time when investors are increasingly pressing major oil companies to start taking climate change seriously and to prepare their business portfolios for a world of peak oil demand, whenever that may come.



Norway, however, is motivating its decision with financial reasons, aiming to cut exposure to the oil price risk. More importantly, the fund will not be divesting from any of the integrated Big Oil firms.Related: Escalating Trade War Signals More Pain For OilAccording to Bloomberg, there is broad support in the Norwegian Parliament to approve today changes to the investment criteria of the sovereign wealth fund, including dumping pure exploration and production oil companies and tightening the rules for investing in coal.According to Germany-based environment and human rights NGO Urgewald, the Norwegian Parliament is expected to vote in favor of the government’s proposal to tighten the coal exclusion criteria of the sovereign fund.



The more stringent criteria expected to be passed by Parliament are “all companies which are operating over 10 GW of coal-fired capacity or producing over 20 million tons of coal annually will be blacklisted by the Norwegian Government Pension Fund.” This would affect eight major companies, including Glencore, Anglo American, Enel, RWE, and BHP Billiton, according to research from NGOs Urgewald and Framtiden i våre hender (Future in our hands).  By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Extreme Weather Could Send Global Energy Demand To Record HighAnalysts: 2019 Oil Demand Growth Could Be Lowest In YearsSmall Crude Build Sends Oil Lower

Brazil’s Petrobras plans to invest a total US$105 billion in the five years to 2023 and divest assets worth US$35 billion, chief executive Roberto Castello Branco said this week as quoted by Reuters. Before Branco took the helm, the five-year investment program stood at US$84.1 billion and divestments were planned at US$26.9 billion.The news comes on the heels of a deal Petrobras struck with the Brazilian antitrust regulator that will allow it to sell several downstream assets in a bid, the company said, to encourage greater competition in the industry. The assets up for sale include eight refineries in seven states.Last week, the company also cleared a major obstacle to further divestments when the Supreme Court of Brazil ruled that Petrobras could sell its subsidiaries without having to first obtain approval from Congress.



This last piece of news is welcomed by the new Brazilian government, which has ambitious privatization plans. In January, the secretary of privatization, Salim Mattar, said that Petrobras should sell most of its 36 subsidiaries as part of the government’s plan to generate US$20 billion from state companies’ asset sales this year.Interestingly, Petrobras’ new chief executive, who took the helm in January, had advocated for a full privatization of the state energy giant. However, since he was picked to lead the oil firm, Castello Branco has ruled out a Petrobras privatization, but still wants to sell non-core assets of the company to reduce its massive net debt of US$72.888 billion as of the end of the third quarter of 2018.Petrobras is the world’s most indebted listed oil company. Since he was picked to lead the oil firm, however, Castello Branco has ruled out a Petrobras privatization, but still wants to sell non-core assets of the company.



The first asset on the line following the Supreme Court ruling would likely be Petrobras’ pipeline unit, TAG, which the company had agreed earlier to sell to France’s Engie for US$8.6 billion.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:The $200 Billion Push In Offshore Oil & GasAnalysts: 2019 Oil Demand Growth Could Be Lowest In YearsThe Gas Flaring Crisis In The U.S. Oil Patch

Shell has struck a deal with refiner PBF Energy to sell it its refinery in Martinez, California, for up to US$1 billion, depending on the closing date, the buyer said in a press release, adding that the acquisition will boost its total throughput capacity to more than 1 million bpd.The Martinez refinery has a capacity of 157,000 bpd. Shell has been trying to sell it for several years, Reuters notes in a report on the news. The supermajor will now fund the turnaround costs for the facility for the first quarter of 2020, estimated at US$70 million, as well as another US$40 million in downtime compensation if the deal does not get finalized by the end of the first quarter of 2020.



Shell first tried to sell the Martinez refinery in 2015, at the height of the latest oil price crisis, so it was no wonder it failed to find any buyers quickly. Now M&A conditions have improved significantly as evidenced by the pickup of mergers and acquisitions in the industry, with the highlight of course being Occidental’s acquisition of Anadarko.For PBF Energy, the deal fits with plans for its California refining expansion. The company already has one refinery in the state, in Torrance, which has a capacity of 160,000 bpd.



“They wanted the two refinery systems, especially considering that when Torrance goes down they just have that one refinery and they don’t make anything back,” an analyst with Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. told Reuters.This seems to be particularly important ahead of the entry into effect of new International Maritime Organization emissions rules. The acquisition, PBF said, will strengthen its position among producers of new-rule compliant fuels. This is an important step for the refiner as the industry is struggling to make refineries compliant with the new, lower-sulfur fuel requirements that will enter into effect next January.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:The $200 Billion Push In Offshore Oil & GasAnalysts: 2019 Oil Demand Growth Could Be Lowest In YearsEscalating Trade War Signals More Pain For Oil

China’s biodiesel imports increased in April 2019, as domestic demand moved up and the supply turned tight.China imported 38,669.1 mt of biodiesel (HS Code: 38260000) in April 2019, a rise of 194.2% month on month, according to data released by the General Administration of Customs.Chinese importers imported more biodiesel as international crude prices rose in April. In addition, diesel demand increased in several areas, where harvesting season created additional demand. Moreover, domestic producers recorded limited utilization rates, leading to tight biodiesel supply.



Biodiesel imports mainly came from Indonesia and Hong Kong, with 34,455.39 mt and 4,010.9 mt for each. Biodiesel imports from the two sources were exempted from consumption tax and 6.5% tariffs, saving almost CNY1,000 of costs for traders.Meanwhile, China exported 68,555.68 mt of biodiesel (HS Code: 38260000) in April, a rise of 112.8% month on month, GAC data showed.Crude prices fell at the end of May 2019, and as a result, oil traders might show limited interest in buying biodiesel due to limited blended diesel demand this month. However, there will be fair demand for biodiesel in the petrochemical industry. Hence, biodiesel imports are expected to inch up in May.



Going forward, international crude prices could remain subdued in June 2019. Meanwhile, the demand for biodiesel in crude blending might decline as overall diesel demand could slow due to rising temperatures. While the demand for chemical-use biodiesel is expected to remain stable. Hence, biodiesel imports might inch lower in June.By JLC InternationalMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:This Overlooked Canadian Oil Niche Is Making Traders BillionsHave Canadian Oil Prices Hit The Sweet Spot?Small Crude Build Sends Oil Lower

Continued clashes in Libya and an escalation of hostilities could threaten the oil production of Wintershall Dea in the North African country, Mario Mehren, the chief executive of the European oil and gas group, told Russian agency TASS in an interview, echoing analyst comments that Libya could be the next sudden supply outage on the global market.  Wintershall Dea’s offshore production is not exposed to risks from fighting on the ground, but the onshore production, the main output for the company in Libya and for the country, could come under threat in case the situation worsens, Mehren said.  Wintershall Dea pumps just over 50,000 bpd onshore, Mehren said, but warned “It is a day-to-day struggle and we do not know how long we can keep that production up under the given the circumstances.” 



Wintershall Dea’s production capacity in Libya is 80,000 bpd, but output has been restricted and intermittent since the summer of 2013 due to the often tense situation in the country, the company says, noting that “the continued tension in the country affects our operations.”While the oil market is fixated on the U.S.-China trade war for signs of demand, and on Iran, Venezuela, and the Middle East for signs of more supply disruptions, investors have not fully priced in the increased risk that Libya’s fighting could result in a serious oil supply outage, analysts said last month.Related: Small Crude Build Sends Oil Lower The security situation in Libya has materially worsened this spring after eastern strongman General Khalifa Haftar ordered in early April his Libyan National Army (LNA) to march on the capital Tripoli. The self-styled army has been clashing with troops of the UN-backed government in a renewed confrontation that could escalate and threaten to disrupt, once again, Libya’s oil production and exports.



Libya’s National Oil Corporation (NOC), the internationally recognized state oil company, started to warn as early as in April that hostilities could threaten production, and this time, the situation could be worse than at the start of the civil war in 2011.    By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Escalating Trade War Signals More Pain For OilThis Overlooked Canadian Oil Niche Is Making Traders BillionsHave Canadian Oil Prices Hit The Sweet Spot?

Exxon plans to drill 90 wells and produce 55,000 barrels of oil equivalent from an oil and gas block in Argentina’s Vaca Muerta shale play, the company said in a statement, noting that this production rate would be achieved in five years.The block Exxon will develop is located in the Neuquen Basin, which has seen a lot of activity from oil and gas companies recently. If all goes according to plan, a further production expansion would be in order, to bring the total production from the block to 75,000 barrels of oil equivalent daily.



The supermajor received a 30-year concession for the block, Bajo del Choique-La Invernada, in 2015 as part of a government push into unconventional oil and gas. Despite the tough investment conditions at the time, Exxon began exploration the following year. To date, there are three wells ready to start commercial production at the site as well as three exploration wells. Exxon has Qatar Petroleum as minority partner in the project.Besides Exxon, BP, Total, and Chevron are among the companies that have already pledged substantial funds for oil and gas exploration and production in Vaca Muerta, which holds reserves estimated at 22.8 billion barrels of oil equivalent.



The country’s energy ministry expects that Vaca Muerta will be instrumental in the planned twofold increase in the national oil and gas production to 1 million bpd of crude and 260 million cubic meters of gas by 2023. That would entail an increase in exports to 500,000 bpd of crude and 80 million cubic meters of gas.However, the oil and gas boom Argentina expected has been slow to materialize because of the underdeveloped infrastructure that makes production from the Vaca Muerta formation too expensive. However the problem is being addressed and Exxon’s decision to double down on the Neuquen Basin block is the latest evidence the Vaca Muerta has a commercial future.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Oil Just Had Its Worst Run Since 2008Saudis: OPEC Close To Extending Output Cut DealNew Infrastructure Could Spur Gas Demand Boost In China

Trafigura’s six-month profit rose to 92 percent as its oil and gas trading desks offset weakness in other divisions, according to Reuters.The hefty increase in profits for the six-month period ending March 31 were the direct result of the major volatility this year in oil prices, as well as its heavy presence in US oil exports, which have seen a marked increase.Trafigura profits, as high as they were, would have been even higher were it not for some of its other segments that did more poorly, such as metals and subsidiaries Puma Energy and Tendril Ventures.



While the profit is remarkable compared to first-half 2018—it should be noted that H1 2018 profit was the lowest in years, at $221.8 million. The reporting period represented a 50% decrease in profits from the previous period.By comparison, Trafigura’s net profit for the six months ending March 31 was $425.7 million. Gross profit for that six-month period rose 50% to $1.47 billion.Trafigura is the second largest oil trader behind Vitol, and was the largest exporter of US crude oil and condensate in 2017. Since then, Trafigura has focused on the United States to avoid the tighter commodity derivative trading regulations in Europe that come with the MiFID II.



Trafigura handles more than 5.5 million barrels per day of oil and other petroleum profits. Trafigura’s US export dealings is set to increase with its latest project in the Gulf of Mexico in Kleberg County. The terminal, if successfully built, will load oil onto VLCCs 12 miles away from shore, in federal waters, which would make it exempt from state regulations, which require companies to eliminate VOCs.

Iran’s oil exports will greatly depend on how China will proceed with its crude oil imports from the Islamic Republic, if at all, after the U.S. removed all sanction waivers for Iranian oil customers, IHS Markit said in an analysis on Tuesday.Despite the U.S. push to drive Iranian oil exports to zero, China is not expected to totally cut off its crude imports from Iran, according to Fotios Katsoulas, Liquid Bulk Principal Analyst, Maritime & Trade at IHS Markit.Still, Chinese oil imports from Iran will likely be very low for a long period of time going forward, Katsoulas said.



China’s total crude oil imports dropped in May from a monthly record in April, as Chinese refiners drastically reduced Iranian oil imports after the end of the U.S. waivers and as some state refineries were offline for planned maintenance.Seng Yick Tee, an analyst with Beijing-based consultancy SIA Energy, told Reuters that the key reason for the lower Chinese crude oil imports in May was the sharp drop in imports from Iran as the U.S. ended all sanction waivers for Iranian customers on May 2, including for Iran’s biggest oil buyer China.China has been Iran’s ninth biggest oil supplier this year, down from the seventh spot last year, IHS Markit has estimated.



China has criticized the U.S. decision to end the sanction waivers and some Chinese refiners may continue to buy Iranian oil as the U.S.-China trade war deteriorates and Beijing could simply brush off the U.S. sanctions on Iranian oil.“However, this behaviour will not be the typical one to observe across China, as several companies have already realised how inconvenient it would be to continue purchasing from Iran,” IHS Markit’s Katsoulas said.From Iran’s point of view, China could be the last hope of keeping Iran’s oil production and exports from total collapse, the analyst said, noting that the rest of the world—including Iran’s second-largest buyer until recently, India—have stopped oil trade flows from the Islamic Republic.

The Sarir oilfield in Libya’s Sirte basin has seen its oil production drop by 30,000 bpd since June 9 when a fire broke out in a power generator due to high temperature, Libya’s National Oil Corporation (NOC) said on Tuesday.The Sarir field, operated by NOC’s subsidiary Arabian Gulf Oil Company (AGOCO), is Libya’s largest oilfield with proven reserves of 4.8 billion barrels, according to the national oil company.Current oil production at the Sarir oil field is around 155,000 bpd.The fire started at the power station at the field and cut off electricity to parts of it, NOC said, adding that “An internal investigation is underway to determine the cause of the temperature rise and an estimated restart date post repair works.” 



Yet, some operations at the field that had been suspended since May due to a technical issue have recently restarted, NOC said.The technical difficulties at the field highlight the fragile state of the Libyan oil industry now that fighting between rival armies continues in and near the capital, Tripoli.While the oil market is fixated on the U.S.-China trade war for signs of demand, and on Iran, Venezuela, and the Middle East for signs of more supply disruptions, investors have not fully priced in the increased risk that Libya’s fighting could result in a serious oil supply outage, analysts say.Related: OPEC’s Struggle To Avoid $40 OilThe security situation in Libya has materially worsened this spring after eastern strongman General Khalifa Haftar ordered in early April his Libyan National Army (LNA) to march on the capital Tripoli.

Sinopec has signed heads of agreement with Russia's Novatek and Gazprombank to establish a joint venture in China for selling liquefied natural gas (LNG) to local end-users, Sinopec announced.The joint venture will purchase LNG produced by Novatek in the Arctic, according to the agreement.The agreement, which is still pending approval, was signed following talks in Moscow between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin.



The agreement will be of considerable economic and social benefit and will further diversify China's natural gas imports, while meeting ever-increasing gas demand in the country, according to Dai Houliang, president of Sinopec Group.Establishment of the joint venture would not only facilitate natural gas sales in China but also provides opportunities for investing in further downstream projects, industry sources said. At the same time, Novatek could mitigate upstream investment risk and control the cost by locking in demand, according to the sources.This agreement is conducive to the upgrading of the strategic cooperative partnership between China and Russia, which has already led to a string of new energy (mega)-projects.



The northern section of the China-Russia Eastern Gas Pipeline from Heihe to Changling is expected to come on stream in October 2019. The middle section (Changling-Yongqing) and the southern section (Yongqing-Shanghai) are projected to become operational at the end of 2020. Construction of the pipeline started in June 2015.Gazprom has nearly completed construction of the No 1 pipeline of the Power of Siberia project and put the No 2 pipeline on agenda.Novatek's Arctic LNG 2 project comprises three 6.6 million mt/year LNG production lines, of which the first is scheduled to be put into production during 2022-2023 and the other two in 2024 and 2025, respectively.By JLC InternationalMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Iran’s Lifeline Against U.S. SanctionsThis Crazy Idea Could Be The Future Of Power GenerationOil Falls After Sharp Rise In Crude, Gasoline Inventories

China has agreed to grant crude oil import licenses to four independent refiners. This is the first round of import license awards for independent refiners since May last year, when Beijing granted licenses to a dozen teapots, S&P Global Platts reports. The awarding will take place later this month after a public review.This latest round of license awards will also raise the total of Chinese refiners granted the right to import crude oil directly to 31 since August 2015. Teapot refiners have been instrumental in the country’s oil demand jump over the last four years, driving up global demand as well and directing oil price predictions from analysts and the oil industry.To date, independent refiners account for about 30 percent of China’s oil processing capacity, which stands at 15 million barrels daily and rising. According to an analysis from Bloomberg released in March, this year will see refining capacity additions of as much as 890,000 bpd. Almost half of this will come from a new 400,000-bpd refinery property of teapot Hengli Petrochemical Co.—an independent refiner—which began trial runs at the facility five months ago. Full capacity was expected to be reached by the end of May.Meanwhile, Beijing has been awarding oil product export quotas and these are higher, too: since the start of the year, the quotas have exceeded 50 million tons of oil products. That’s despite an oversupply on the domestic market that has begun seeping into neighboring markets, pushing refiners’ margins lower.Chinese refining rates hit an all-time high in April, at 12.68 million barrels daily. For the first four months of the year, the daily average stood at 12.62 million bpd. In January this year, CNPC, the country’s largest oil company, saidit expected 12.68 million bpd to be the average processing rate for local refineries this year as a whole.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Papua New Guinea Looks To Double LNG ProductionPlatts: OPEC Oil Production Slumps With Saudis Cutting DeeperOPEC’s Struggle To Avoid $40 Oil

Shell has finally sent the first shipment of liquefied natural gas from its Prelude floating production facility off the coast of Australia. S&P Global Platts reports that the cargo is bound for Asia, although the name of the buyer was not disclosed.Prelude has been a highly anticipated addition to the world’s LNG export capacity amid strong demand and despite a glut that has had some in the industry and analysts worried that future capacity would be insufficient. With an annual capacity of 3.6 million tons of LNG, the project is an important addition to Australia’s claim to fame as the world’s future number-one LNG exporter.



""The first [LNG] cargo was more than eight years after FID and nearly two years after the facility arrived in Australia. How fast Prelude delivers its second and third cargo, and ramps up to plateau output, will be a key indicator of success,"" a Wood Mackenzie analyst told S&P Global Platts. Daniel Toleman added that ""With Prelude on stream, Australia is on track to export more than 80 million mt/year of LNG, which surpasses Qatar as the largest LNG producer in the world.""Related: Papua New Guinea Looks To Double LNG ProductionThe Prelude is the last of the large-scale LNG projects to launch in Australia in the last few years. Last year two other ones began production: Inpex’ Ichthys and Chevron’s Wheatstone. As a result, the country’s Department of Industry forecast LNG exports to reach 74.9 million tons in fiscal 2018/2019 to the end of this month. For the next fiscal year, the department has projected LNG exports of 78.3 million tons, counting Prelude.



In its latest LNG Outlook, Shell forecast LNG demand to rise by 27 million tons this year, to 319 million tons, and further to 384 million tons in 2020. Over the medium to long term, the supermajor even warned of the possibility of a shortage unless a sufficient amount of new production capacity comes on stream. That’s despite challenges around LNG export projects currently under development, such as a shortage of willingness for long-term commitments on the part of buyers and investors.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Platts: OPEC Oil Production Slumps With Saudis Cutting DeeperCan Trump Rely On The Saudis As Oil Prices Crash?OPEC’s No.2 Steps In To Replace Lost Iranian Oil

India is holding a series of telephone conversations with US Secretary of Energy Rick Perry on Monday to discuss the oil price volatility created in part by the perception of a tighter oil market in the wake of US sanctions on India’s neighbor, Iran, according to a press release from India’s Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas.India’s Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas Dharmendra Pradhan also discussed crude oil purchases from the United States, and ways to “further develop gas-based economy in India.”The spot price of a Brent barrel fluctuated between $60 ad $64 in the last week alone. While it has come down substantially since mid-May when Brent was sitting around $72 to barrel, oil prices are still up significantly from the lows this year in January when prices were closer to $50 per barrel.



The higher prices are a significant concern for India, who has a high import need for crude. In 2018, India imported the third-highest volume of crude oil by value after China and the United States.Secretary Perry and Minister Pradhan also discussed the important role that the United States has in establishing the global oil price stability.Reports in late May suggested that India may decide to resume oil purchases from Iran, after India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi won the country’s elections, according to an Indian news outlet.



India is feeling the pinch of the US sanctions on Iran after the US refused to renew the sanction waivers that it had granted to eight large Iranian oil buyers, including India. For now, Indian refineries have made up for the loss of Iranian barrels by increasing its purchases of oil from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, according to Sputnik. Some Iranian oil is still trickling into India that was purchased prior to the end of the sanction waiver expiration, the outlet reported.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:A New Trend In The Middle East?

Of all the signatories to the OPEC+ agreement forged to rebalance the oil market through production cuts, Russia is the lone holdout, according to Saudi Arabia’s Energy Minister Khalid Al-Falih, cited in The New Arab, and is the last member to not get on board with additional production cuts.The comment was made during the meeting between Al-Falih and Alexander Novak that is taking place on Monday to discuss various energy projects between Russia and Saudi Arabia.Russia has been a wild card during this entire production quota process, sometimes with various Russian officials disagreeing in the media over what oil price should be targeted, what production cuts will balance the market, how quickly to scale down production, how quickly to ramp production back up, and what compensation, if any, Russian oil producers should receive in exchange for restricting oil output.



Russia’s oil production prowess is substantial, and for the first time since the quota was implemented, Russia restricted its output in May. Russia’s oil production decrease in May was largely due to oil contamination issues.“So, I think the remaining country to jump onboard now is Russia. I will wait for the Russian dynamics to work themselves out,” Al-Falih told TASS, adding that there was still a debate within Russia about what level of oil production Russia should target for H2 2019.Russia and Saudi Arabia are the two largest oil producers that are part of the OPEC+ agreement.



Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said on Monday that there was a risk still that oil prices could fall to $30 per barrel, because the amount of oil produced in H2 could exceed market demand for oil—a sign that Russia may actually be on board for an extension of the production cuts, at least in some form and in some quantity.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:A New Trend In The Middle East?

In April, Novatek signed agreements with two Chinese companies, under which the Asian firms will become shareholders in the Arctic LNG project with 10 percent each. Earlier this year, France’s Total, a partner of Novatek in the producing Yamal LNG project, signed a deal to buy a direct 10-percent interest in Arctic LNG 2.The final investment decision on the Arctic LNG 2 project is expected to be made in the second half of 2019, while the first liquefaction train is planned to start up in 2023.At the end of last week, Russia and Saudi Arabia held talks about investments worth tens of billions of U.S. dollars in various energy projects.  Related: A New Trend In The Middle East? Oman Taxes Energy Drinks As Oil Income FallsApart from Arctic LNG 2, Aramco is looking at other projects in Russia, including potential projects with oil giant Rosneft and with natural gas giant Gazprom, as well as in petrochemicals, al-Falih told TASS.



Aramco could also be interested in some joint projects or even equity investment in Russia’s petrochemical company Sibur, “but the interest has to be from both sides. So we will wait for Sibur and its shareholders to express their interest in future cooperation,” al-Falih told TASS.Referring to the OPEC+ production cut deal after the talks he held with Russia’s top officials last week, the Saudi energy minister told TASS that “I am fairly confident that from the OPEC side almost everyone agrees that we need to extend the Declaration of Cooperation,” adding that “So, I think the remaining country to jump onboard now is Russia.”   By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Iran Won’t Leave OPECThe Next Headache For Canada’s Oil PatchOil Is On The Brink Of A Bear Market

U.S. refiners and motorists may have dodged a bullet after the U.S. suspended indefinitely the threat to impose tariffs on all imports from Mexico after reaching a deal on immigration with its southern neighbor.Since a week before Friday, June 7—when President Donald Trump said that the tariffs that would have entered into force on June 10 are indefinitely suspended—oil industry executives and lobbyists have been frantically urging state officials from the White House to the Commerce Department to the Treasury to reconsider the tariffs on imports of crude oil from Mexico.    Gulf Coast refineries import heavy oil from Mexico to blend with the lighter oil to produce gasoline and other refined oil products. The tariffs that President Trump threatened at the end of May would have meant that U.S. refiners would pay more for the heavy crude from Mexico in a global market that is already short of heavy oil with the U.S. sanctions on Iran and with the sanctions on Venezuela, which resulted in U.S. imports from the Latin American country plunging from 603,000 bpd for the week ending January 25 to just 12,000 bpd for the week ending May 31.



So executives and lobbyists were busy working for a week toward some kind of solution or compromise and called for crude oil imports to be exempted from the tariffs on Mexico.Last year, U.S. crude oil imports from Mexico averaged 665,000 bpd and accounted for most U.S. energy imports from Mexico, according to EIA data. Mexico was the source of 9 percent of U.S. imported crude oil, America’s third-biggest foreign oil supplier, behind only Canada and Saudi Arabia.  Related: Large Chinese Refiner Starts Construction Of 320,000 Bpd ComplexChet Thompson, President and CEO of the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers (AFPM), said in a statement right after the Trump Administration announced tariffs on products made in Mexico:



“Imposing tariffs on Mexican products, particularly crude oil, could raise energy prices for U.S. consumers, disadvantage the U.S. refining industry and jeopardize passage of USMCA — all bad outcomes. We thus urge the President not to pursue energy tariffs against one of our most important trading partners.”In the week when tariffs on Mexican goods were on the table and imminent, lobbyists were busy explaining to the administration that tariffs on Mexican crude oil in a tight heavy crude market would mean rising gasoline prices just at the start of the summer driving season, a refinery lobbyist told Reuters last week.

Shenghong Group started to build a 16 million mt/yr (320,000 bbl/day) crude distillation unit (CDU) and some other units in Jiangsu province on June 1, which indicated that the company launched the full-scale construction of its new refinery.This is the largest CDU in China.The company also began construction of a 3.10 million mt/yr continuous reform, a coal gasification unit and some other units on the day in east China's Lianyungang city, the company said.



Shenghong's 320,000 bbl/day refinery will be another large private refining-chemical one in China, following Hengli Petrochemical and Zhejiang Petrochemical. The refinery, scheduled to come online in 2021, will produce a total of about 5.90 million mt of gasoline and diesel per year when it runs at full capacity.Increasing supply when demand lags behind will intensify competition in the domestic market which is already oversupplied. Refineries with a total capacity of 5.08 million bbl/day are scheduled to come on stream during 2019-2024 according to recent JLC data. Hengli Petrochemical and Zhejiang Petrochemical expect to start supplying gasoline and diesel in the second half of 2019, to be followed by more refineries in the coming years.On the demand front, gasoline demand growth has been slowing as a direct result of disappointing car sales in China. A total of 28.08 million conventional cars were sold in 2018, a decline of 2.8% from the previous year, according to industry data. Meanwhile, the sales of ‘new energy vehicles’, such as EVs and hybrids saw a 61.7% jump year on year. The sales of conventional cars are expected to stabilize in 2019, while those of new energy cars will jump further.



In addition, gasoline demand will be impacted further by alternative energy such as ethanol gasoline and methanol gasoline.And it’s not just gasoline, diesel demand is under pressure because of slowing economic growth, the country's supply-side reform, and stricter environmental regulation that constrains industrial activities.As the glut of refined products continues to grow, China is set to boost oil product exports significantly this year.By JLC InternationalMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:The Second Machine Age Could Crash Oil PricesPeace And Oil: Trump’s Endgame In Saudi ArabiaThe Single Biggest Challenge For The Oil & Gas Industry

China’s crude oil imports dropped in May from a monthly record in April, as Chinese refiners drastically reduced Iranian oil imports after the end of the U.S. waivers and as some state refineries were offline for planned maintenance.According to data from China’s General Administration of Customs, reported by Reuters, Chinese crude oil imports fell by 8 percent from 43.73 million tons in April to 40.23 million tons in May. This, converted in barrels per day, is an 11-percent drop from April to May, to average 9.47 million bpd last month, according to Reuters estimates.According to Seng Yick Tee, an analyst with Beijing-based consultancy SIA Energy, the key reason for the lower Chinese crude oil imports in May was the sharp drop in imports from Iran as the U.S. ended all sanction waivers for Iranian customers on May 2, including for Iran’s biggest oil buyer China.



In April, just before the waivers ended, China had stocked on Iranian crude oil. China imported around 800,000 bpd of crude from Iran in April—the highest amount that Iran’s top oil customer had purchased since August of 2018—as Chinese refiners rushed to buy Iranian oil ahead of the expiry of the U.S. sanction waivers.The surge in Iranian imports in April resulted in China setting a new monthly oil import record that month, despite the fact that there was refinery maintenance and fuel demand was lukewarm, analysts told Reuters at the time.Apart from the sharp drop in Iranian imports and regular maintenance at several refineries, another factor for the decline in Chinese crude oil imports in May were the weak refining margins across Asia.



Although refiners in Asia are not left without choice for crude oil after the end of the U.S. sanction waivers for Iranian oil, the higher price of alternative supplies, as well as soaring fuel exports from China, are depressing refining margins across Asia.Last month, reports emerged that persistent pressure on profit margins had forced Asian refiners to start considering a reduction in their run rates as Asia’s refining margins slipped to a 16-year low. By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:The Second Machine Age Could Crash Oil PricesPeace And Oil: Trump’s Endgame In Saudi ArabiaThe Single Biggest Challenge For The Oil & Gas Industry

Three Greenpeace activists stopped a BP exploration rig that was supposed to leave this weekend from Scotland to an offshore oil field.In a Tweet, one of the activists who identified herself as Jo, posted a statement saying, “I'm occupying a @BP_plc oil rig that intends to drill up 30 million barrels of climate wrecking oil in the North Sea. As long as I'm here, the rig isn't going anywhere.”



A later statement released by the organization to media and quoting the same activist said “This rig and the 30 million barrels it seeks to drill, are a sure a sign that BP are committed to business as usual, fueling a climate emergency that threatens millions of lives and the future of the living world,” as quoted by Reuters.BP said in response that “While we recognize the right for peaceful protest, the actions of this group are irresponsible and may put themselves and others unnecessarily at risk.” The supermajor added that it was working with the rig’s owner, Transocean, to fund a solution to the situation. BP further added that it supported the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and shared Greenpeace’s concern about the environment.



Yet the organization will hardly take BP’s assurances to heart. In a string of Tweets, the activist that posted the original announcement of the rig boarding said BP was spending billions on new exploration despite its claims to support climate action.This is the second recent environmentalist attack on the UK-based oil supermajor. Last month, amid large-scale protests in London initiated by Extinction Rebellion, Greenpeace activists staged a blockade of BP’s HQ. Again, the motive was to force BP to stop oil and gas exploration. The plan was to keep the blockade for at least a week but the custom-made boxes housing activists in front of every entry of the building were removed sooner.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:The Bearish Threat Within OPECCheap Gas To Fuel New Global Demand BoomAn Opportunity In California’s Overlooked Oil Sector

Russia and Saudi Arabia are holding talks about investments worth tens of billions of U.S. dollars in various energy projects, Russia’s Energy Minister Alexander Novak said at an economic forum in Russia on Friday.Russia and Saudi Arabia have many bilateral projects, and their respective energy ministers discussed some of them at their meeting on the sidelines of the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum in Russia on Thursday.The two countries are planning projects in petrochemicals, liquefied natural gas (LNG), and joint research centers in Russia, Sputnik quoted Novak as saying on Friday.The talks are being held at a critical time when Saudi Arabia—or, rather, OPEC—needs Russia to be amenable to extending the production quotas past the June expiry.



At the meeting with Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih on Thursday, Novak said that Saudi Arabia is one of Russia’s key partners in the Middle East.The Russia-Saudi partnership is evolving, including with the cooperation between the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) and the Saudi Arabian sovereign wealth fund, which have invested around US$2 billion in joint projects, Novak said at the meeting with al-Falih, as carried by the Russian energy ministry.Gazprom, Gazprom Neft, Transneft, and other Russian companies are interested in cooperation with Saudi firms, Novak said. Related: New Infrastructure Could Spur Gas Demand Boost In ChinaSaudi Aramco, on the other hand, has long been rumored to be considering buying a stake in the Arctic LNG 2 project led by Russian gas company Novatek.



In March this year, Novatek’s CEO Leonid Mikhelson told Russian media that the Russian firm was ready to consider selling up to 30 percent in the Arctic LNG 2 project to Aramco.In April, Novatek signed agreements with two Chinese companies, under which the Asian firms will become shareholders in the Arctic LNG project with 10 percent each. Earlier this year, France’s Total, a partner of Novatek in the producing Yamal LNG project, signed a deal to buy a direct 10-percent interest in Arctic LNG 2.The final investment decision on the Arctic LNG 2 project is expected to be made in the second half of 2019, while the first liquefaction train is planned to start up in 2023.

The United States slapped Iran with additional sanctions, this time on largest petrochemical holding group, for supporting the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), the US Treasury Department said on Friday.Today’s target was the Persian Gulf Petrochemical Industry Company (PGPIC), who the US says has been funneling money to the organization responsible for Iran’s nuclear program and considered a terrorist group by the United States.The United States had originally planned to target the petrochemical company a while ago, but delayed its decision in the wake of escalating tensions following the accusations made by the United States that Iran was responsible for the tanker explosions off the Strait of Hormuz just weeks ago.



Just how financially intertwined the petrochem company is with the IRGC is unknown, but Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, when he was director of the CIA, said that companies overseen by the IRGC could control as much as 20% of Iran’s economy.While some analysts are suggesting that this latest round of sanctions feels more symbolic than effective, the company targeted is the second largest petrochemical holding company in the Middle East. It raked in $1.2 billion in revenue in a single quarter in 2018.Speaking of Iran’s petrochem industry as a whole, Iranian politician Ali Bakhtiar told Iranian news outlet ICANA that the likelihood of the United States sanctioning Iran’s petrochem industry was “a media stunt and not something doable and feasible”.



“The issue of petrochemicals is different from oil. The United States thinks that Saudi Arabia can produce more petrochemicals like oil and make up for Iran’s absence in the market. Not only does Saudi Arabia not have this capability, there are serious doubts if the Arab country can replace Iranian oil.”The US Department of Treasury press release warned that there would be more sanctions against Iran’s petrochem industry forthcoming.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:World Bank Cuts Russia 2019 Growth Outlook On Oil CutsOilfield Services Feel The Pain As Crude Prices DropOPEC+ Has Only One Choice As Oil Prices Slide

The Democrat party is torn again between its more progressive members who want to make the Presidential election in 2020 all about the climate and those members who are more moderate in their climate views.About 50 members of the Democratic National Committee have officially pushed for the DNC to hold a presidential debate about nothing other than the climate, according to Huffington Post, but their proposal is getting some pushback.The DNC members plan to submit the official resolution in support of a climate change debate at the DNC meeting that will take place later in June. It is expected that DNC chairman Tom Perez will reject the resolution.



The party is finding itself at odds with each other in the runup to the 2020 presidential election, with die-hard climate-agendaed democrats—like Gov. Jay Inslee—on one side and more moderate democrats who’s pro-climate stance isn’t quite good enough for the likes of AOC—like Joe Biden—on the other.Inslee had already asked the DNC to hold a climate-centered debate, but his requested has already been rejected.Related: New Infrastructure Could Spur Gas Demand Boost In ChinaInslee, who is focusing his bid for President on climate issues, is bringing up the rear in the polls. Biden, who has issued a more subdued climate plan of his own yet has been chastised for not going far enough by more climate-enthusiastic democrats, is in the lead. Biden has upped his climate game in recent days after being criticized by his fellow Dems who are more emphatic in their climate agendas.



Washington Democratic Party Chairwoman Tina Podlodowski spearheaded the protests by the DNC about their rejection of the climate debate, arguing that this is the direction younger party members want to go:“It’s a tremendous opportunity as far as I’m concerned to show where Democrats stand on this issue, not just about saving the planet but how it’s an economic issue, how it’s an income inequality issue and really show Democratic unity here. It’s the No. 1 issue for younger voters in our party and if we want them to turn out, we should show them the respect they deserve in hearing solutions to an issue that they are going to face far more than those of us in our 50s, 60s, 70s and 80s moving forward,” Podlodowski told HuffPost.“By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:World Bank Cuts Russia 2019 Growth Outlook On Oil CutsOilfield Services Feel The Pain As Crude Prices DropOPEC+ Has Only One Choice As Oil Prices Slide

Due to competition from liquefied natural gas (LNG) and better market regulation, many European countries renegotiated their contracts for Russian pipeline gas supply in 2018, saving as much as US$8 billion on their Russian gas import bill, Fatih Birol, the Executive Director of the International Energy Agency (IEA), told Reuters on Friday.“Because of the big challenge from LNG and better regulation, there was a lot of renegotiation of pipeline contracts and we estimate in 2018, Russian pipeline exports to Europe were $8 billion cheaper than they would have been with conventional oil indexation,” Birol told Reuters on the day on which the Paris-based agency released its Gas 2019 report.Russia says that its pipeline gas exports is cheaper than American LNG, but countries in central and eastern Europe, such as Poland and Lithuania, are eager to wean off the Russian gas teat, which, they say, comes with political leverage for Moscow.



The price of LNG that the United States is exporting to Europe will stay competitive with Russian pipeline gas supplies in the long term, U.S. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry said earlier this week.“This idea that somehow ... LNG can’t compete with pipelined gas is just false,” Reuters quoted Secretary Perry as saying on the sidelines of a conference in Slovenia, as the United States is authorizing additional volumes of LNG exports, calling its LNG “freedom gas.”In its Gas 2019 report published on Friday, the IEA said that Europe’s gas consumption is expected to remain flat in the coming years, but domestic production is forecast to drop at an average rate of 3.5 percent annually due to the phase-out at the Groningen field in the Netherlands and falling North Sea production.



“This structural decline in domestic production, combined with the expiry of several long term pipeline contracts, opens opportunities for new sources of supply, including LNG,” the IEA said in the report.  By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads from Oilprice.com:World Bank Cuts Russia 2019 Growth Outlook On Oil CutsOilfield Services Feel The Pain As Crude Prices DropOPEC+ Has Only One Choice As Oil Prices Slide

Seventeen major automakers, including GM and Ford, are calling for a compromise between the Trump Administration and California on the fuel economy standards through one nationwide broadly supported final rule, in order to avoid regulatory uncertainty and “an extended period of litigation and instability.”  In a letter to U.S. President Donald Trump, the major carmakers said that “What works best for consumers, communities, and the millions of U.S. employees that work in the auto industry is one national standard that is practical, achievable, and consistent across the 50 states.”Last summer, the Trump Administration unveiled proposed rulemaking for rolling back Obama-era fuel economy standards. The proposed rulemaking is intended “to correct the national automobile fuel economy and greenhouse gas emissions standards to give the American people greater access to safer, more affordable vehicles that are cleaner for the environment,” the Department of Transportation says.The plan is fiercely opposed by California, which says that the proposed weakening of the emission rules is a “brazen attack” on clean car standards.



Negotiations between the Trump Administration and California broke down in February this year after the White House discontinued discussions saying that “Despite the Administration’s best efforts to reach a common-sense solution, it is time to acknowledge that CARB has failed to put forward a productive alternative” to the proposed rule.In March this year, reports emerged that the White House pressured automakers to support the Trump Administration’s proposal to roll back fuel economy standards, but car companies are wary of the uncertainty as California pushes back.In the letter to President Trump dated June 6, the major automakers said:“We encourage both the federal government and California to resume discussions and to remain open to regulatory adjustments that provide the flexibility needed to meet future environmental goals and respond to consumer needs.”



In a warning to the Administration, the carmakers said:“For our companies, a broadly supported final rule would provide regulatory certainty and enhance our ability to invest and innovate by avoiding an extended period of litigation and instability, which could prove as untenable as the current program.” By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:World Bank Cuts Russia 2019 Growth Outlook On Oil CutsOilfield Services Feel The Pain As Crude Prices DropOPEC+ Has Only One Choice As Oil Prices Slide

Washington has tightened its grip on Venezuela by extending sanctions to companies supplying diluents to the South American country.“We are tightening the loop on any potential workarounds on the standing sanctions that allow the Maduro regime to still find ways to exploit PDVSA as a cash cow,” one Washington official told Reuters, adding “The changing of the language [of the Venezuela sanctions statement] puts international companies on notice that any continued engagement or transactions they have with PDVSA selling diluents is at risk, or subject to future potential sanctions.”The United States has been targeting Venezuela with increasing sanction pressure since January when President Nicolas Maduro was inaugurated for a second term in office after last year’s elections that the U.S. called illegitimate.



The sanctions have effectively put a stop to Venezuelan crude oil exports to U.S. refiners, which has happened at an increasingly inconvenient time for the latter: the crude oil produced closest to the Gulf Coast, in the Permian, is increasingly light, some of it bordering on superlight, and cannot be processed effectively at the refineries, which need heavy oil to blend the light with.Meanwhile, Venezuela’s oil exports slumped by 17 percent last month as a result of the sanctions. Between January and March 2019, Gulf Coast oil imports from the country in particular plummeted by 498,000 bpd to 47,000 bpd in March.“That’s a big structural problem that’s not going to go away anytime soon. We’ve got this mismatch in the country,” one analyst told Reuters. “We’ve got refineries that want heavy oil and producers that make light oil.”



Even so, the tightening hold on Venezuela is unlikely to relax anytime soon. The U.S. was the first foreign government to throw its support behind Venezuela’s opposition leader Juan Guaido, who has put in a lot of effort to spark mass protests against the Maduro government but without any actual success in removing said government.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Oil Just Had Its Worst Run Since 2008Putin: Russia Is Fine With $60 OilThe Gas Flaring Crisis In The U.S. Oil Patch

As if already preparing for its exit from the OPEC production cut deal that seeks to drawdown global inventories of crude oil to rebalance the market, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak vowed on Thursday to increase its oil output after June, according to Reuters.Russia’s recent decline of production, according to Novak, was caused by a combination of refinery maintenance and contaminated oil flowing through the Druzhba pipeline—issues that will be resolved after June, coincidentally when the oil production cut deal is set to expire.Alexander Dyukov, CEO of Gazprom Neft, said that the contamination issue had not affected oil output at all. “It hasn’t affected the company’s oil output at all. We simply sent the oil through other routes,” according to Reuters.



Novak had a different take on why its output had fallen below the level agreed to with OPEC, “Partly, this is due to the restoration of (oil) quality in the pipeline.”Russia’s largest oil producer, Rosneft, is in talks with the government for possible compensation for losses should OPEC and its allies decide in June to extend the output cuts according to Sechin. Sechin has been critical of the deal that Russia forged with its OPEC counterpart.It is no secret that when it comes to breakeven prices, Russia is positioned differently than OPEC’s de facto leader, Saudi Arabia, and as such, Russia doesn’t require as high of a breakeven in order to keep its budget. Russia has crafted its budget based on oil at $40 per barrel. Saudi Arabia, on the other hand, has a budget based on oil at $85 per barrel.

 Oil prices rose on Thursday afternoon after reports surfaced that the United States may consider delaying the tariffs it has threatened to impose on its Latin American neighbor, according to Bloomberg. The threat of tariffs of Mexico’s goods came as US President Donald Trump tries to stop the flow of migrants coming into the United States.At 3:12pm EST, WTI was trading up $0.99 at $52.67 (+1.92%), while Brent crude was trading up $1.14 at $61.77 (+1.88%).Earlier, Former Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez said that he expected that the 5% version of the tariffs would be imposed on Monday, because Mexico would not have had time over the weekend to come up with an immigration plan, according to CNBC.Art Cashin of UBS Financial Services told CNBC on Thursday that the market would tolerate the tariff being imposed on Mexico—it just wouldn’t tolerate it if it lasts. He expects the tariffs would last no longer than a week.“They’re assuming it may be too late to either postpone it or change it, so they’ll get imposed. But they assume they’ll come off within a week,” Cashin told CNBC.The original plan was to eventually increase the tariffs to 25% by October, with incremental increases if Mexico fails to successfully implement a plan to stop migrants from flooding into the United States.Related: Oil Just Had Its Worst Run Since 2008The United States imported an average of 712,000 barrels per day of crude oil and petroleum products in March 2019, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA), most of which is crude oil.

The United States is using energy as a political weapon and its ‘golden era’ of energy could turn out to be an ‘era of energy colonialism’ for all other market participants, Igor Sechin, the chief executive of Russia’s largest oil producer Rosneft, said at a forum in Russia on Thursday.There is no doubt that the U.S. is using energy as a political weapon on a mass scale, Sechin said at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum today, as posted on Rosneft’s website.mposing sanctions or even the threat of sanctions have a destructive effect on the global energy ecosystem, Sechin said, criticizing America’s approach to energy dominance.



“The golden era of American energy is now underway,” U.S. President Donald Trump said last month, while U.S. officials have started to refer to the U.S. exports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) as “freedom gas.”The United States has long been accusing Russia of using energy, especially pipeline Russian gas to Europe, as a political weapon.   Now the head of Russia’s biggest oil producer and a close ally of President Vladimir Putin is returning the favor by accusing the U.S. of wanting to suppress competitors and pariah states by imposing sanctions.



The Texas oil boom was the result of new sanctions that the U.S. slapped on Iran and Venezuela, sharply reducing their respective oil production, Sechin said, noting that as much as 2.5 million bpd of oil production could be subject to sanctions this year, up from 1.5 million bpd in 2018.In order to have further growth in Texas, the U.S. may need to find a “new sanctions victim” and remove its oil supply from the market in order to replace it with Texas oil, Rosneft’s boss said, adding that “Any oil producing country could be that victim.”Earlier this week, Sechin—who has criticized Russia’s involvement in the OPEC+ deal in the past—questioned the Russian rationale of sticking to the cuts, saying that the U.S. would take market share away from of Russia if the OPEC/non-OPEC deal is extended.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:How Oil Defeated The NazisA ‘’Gusher Of Red Ink’’ For U.S. ShaleNew Infrastructure Could Spur Gas Demand Boost In China

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is confident that Nicolas Maduro will eventually be toppled, but is uncertain when this could happen because the U.S. has found uniting Venezuelan opposition more difficult than initially thought, The Washington Post reports, citing an audio recording of a recent closed-door meeting that it has obtained.Earlier this year, the United States and many other western countries recognized opposition leader Juan Guaidó as Venezuela’s interim president and supported him in the power struggle over the country sitting on the world’s largest crude oil reserves. The U.S. slapped sanctions on Venezuela’s oil industry and exports in an attempt to deprive the Maduro regime of as much oil revenues—the only hard currency Venezuela can get these days—as possible.                                                                                      At the closed-door meeting in New York last week, Pompeo said, according to the audio recording The Washington Post has revealed:



“Our conundrum, which is to keep the opposition united, has proven devilishly difficult.”  More than forty people would vie to be Maduro’s successor the moment he leaves, Pompeo said at the meeting.Maduro will be forced out eventually, Pompeo said, but added that “I couldn’t tell you the timing.



Maduro is surrounded mostly by Cubans, Pompeo said, noting that “He doesn’t trust Venezuelans a lick. I don’t blame him. He shouldn’t. They were all plotting against him. Sadly, they were all plotting for themselves,” according to the audio recording.  Earlier this week, U.S. National Security Advisor John Bolton tweeted that “Cuba has continued to prop up the illegitimate Maduro regime in Venezuela and will be held responsible for this ongoing man-made crisis.  President Trump has made it clear that we stand with the Cuban and Venezuelan people as they fight for freedom.” Meanwhile, Venezuela’s crippled oil industry continues to suffer, with May exports slumping by 17 percent after the country shut down almost all of its crude oil upgraders.  By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:U.S. Total Oil Output Poised To Set New 2019 RecordThe Gas Flaring Crisis In The U.S. Oil PatchHow Oil Defeated The Nazis

Royal Dutch Shell and Gazprom Neft have agreed to create a joint venture that will be exploring and developing oil fields in the Yamal region in Russia, the oil arm of Russian gas giant Gazprom said on Thursday.Shell and Gazprom Neft have signed the documents to create a 50/50 joint venture that will be managed on an equal basis by the partners in a rare move of an international oil major into Russia’s oil sector, some of which has been subject to Western sanctions since the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014.The joint venture deal is expected to be finalized in late 2019 or early next year, pending all necessary corporate and regulatory approvals and once all legal preconditions have been met, Gazprom Neft said in a statement.



“As part of this new agreement we will be able to reveal the full potential of what is a major hydrocarbon cluster in Yamal, viably and efficiently. We will be investigating further opportunities for implementing projects with Shell in the future, including projects outside of Russia,” said Alexander Dyukov, Chairman of the Management Board at Gazprom Neft.Shell’s chief executive officer, Ben van Beurden, also commented on the agreement, saying in Gazprom Neft’s statement that “This is yet another milestone in our partnership with Gazprom Neft. Over the years, we have built a trusted and fruitful relationship.”Shell and Gazprom Neft have been working in Russia to develop the Salym group of oil fields.



Gazprom Neft plans to invest more in exploration and aims to boost oil production regardless of the ongoing OPEC+ production cuts.In March this year, Gazprom Neft’s Dyukov said that he did not think the production cut deal between Russia and OPEC would last long, and that the Russian company was not even considering the cuts in its long-term plans. Gazprom Neft said it had plans to maintain or even increase production after 2020.

Qatar plans to use money from its sovereign wealth fund to diversify its energy mix, its Finance Minister, Ali Shareef Emadi, said at the Petersburg International Economic Forum as quoted by Sputnik.""In the coming years, we will experience a huge energy transformation and energy will play a leading role around the world in medium and long terms. Energy will remain an important part of our economy,” Emadi said, adding “That is why the role of the sovereign wealth fund of Qatar is important. The future of our country depends on it. At the same time, this fund will also invest in other types of energy.""The official, however, did not elaborate on the types of energy Qatar plans to invest in. The tiny Gulf state, which has been under an economic blockade by its neighbors led by Saudi Arabia for two years now, is the world’s largest liquefied natural gas producer and exporter. It is also a minor oil producer.



Qatar used to be a member of OPEC but last December quit the organization, saying the decision was part of a long-term strategy for growing its international presence on energy markets with a focus on gas.Its Energy Minister said the decision had been hard to make since Qatar had been a member of the cartel for almost six decades, but it had very little influence on OPEC decisions. Qatar produces about 600,000 bpd, which ranks it among the smaller OPEC producers.In gas, however, things are different. The country’s proven gas reserves are estimated at 880 trillion cu ft and it last year announced plans to boost its liquefied natural gas production to as much as 100 million tons annually, from a current rate of 77 million tons. It exports gas at a daily rate of about 11 billion cu ft and accounts for almost a third of the global LNG market.



Qatar is also expanding internationally. Also in December 2018, Qatar Petroleum’s chief executive said the company planned to invest up to US$20 billion in U.S. LNG and oil projects.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:The Gas Flaring Crisis In The U.S. Oil PatchHow Oil Defeated The NazisIran’s Lifeline Against U.S. Sanctions

Tesla’s sales in North America, its home market, reached an all-time high, according to a report by Electrek, which cited exclusive information supplied by unnamed sources.Since the start of the second quarter, the electric carmaker had delivered 33,000 cars and was now going for another 33,000 by the end of June. According to the sources, the carmaker had offered is employees sizeable bonuses if the target is hit: US$1,200 per sales employee and US$550 per delivery employee. If they exceed the 33,000 target and achieve 36,000 in sales, the bonuses would be doubled the sources told Electrek.



Deliveries since the start of June come in at 2,512 but a lot more are planned, the sources said, including 10,000 scheduled deliveries and 6,000 orders matched to vehicle identification numbers.The news breaks on the heels of another positive report on Tesla: the company launched its Chinese-made Model 3 at the end of last week for pre-order and its website crashed soon after under the flow of traffic. On Friday, Tesla priced its China-made Model 3 at US$47,500 (328,000 yuan) for the Standard Range Plus version, below the price of Model 3 that Tesla already sells on the Chinese market, at prices starting at US$54,600 (377,000 yuan).



Tesla's last record in deliveries was achieved in the last quarter of 2018—the company’s first profitable quarter since its inception—and it totaled 90,700 cars. Many will probably doubt Tesla’s ability to repeat the success or even exceed it, but surprises are always possible with the EV maker.The latest was the revelation that GM and Fiat Chrysler had been buying greenhouse emissions credits from Tesla, effectively funding their biggest competitor in the nascent EV segment. The report certainly has an ironic twist given Elon Musk’s accusations that large carmakers such as GM and Fiat Chryslers have been trying to prevent Tesla from succeeding in the market. It is similarly ironic for GM and Fiat Chrysler, which have both tried to win some market share from Tesla but without a lot of success.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:The Gas Flaring Crisis In The U.S. Oil PatchHow Oil Defeated The NazisIran’s Lifeline Against U.S. Sanctions

Venezuela’s officially recognized president Nicolas Maduro on Wednesday called on the world to take care of Mother Earth, claiming that the only way to achieve balance is through ecosocialism. The call comes on World Environment Day, according to Prensa Latina.Ecosocialists argue that the only surefire way to arrest climate change is to give capitalism the old heave-ho, forgoing profits in exchange for more earth-friendly decision making.Venezuela, which is suffering the worst humanitarian crisis in history apart from in Yemen, relies on crude oil for 98% of its export revenues. Venezuela also has a booming mining industry, including bauxite, coltan, coal, gold, and iron ore—at least they did prior to US sanctions.



Maduro opened up the Orinoco Mining Belt to mining a few years ago—mostly unregulated—an act that raised just a handful of eyebrows that would have typically decried the destructive nature of the processes, including deforestation and mercury poisoning.  The Orinoco Arc covers 43,000 square miles and covers an eighth of Venezuela’s total land.Marshall Billingslea, assistant secretary for terrorist financing at the US Treasury Department, accused Maduro of turning “to wholesale, rampant destruction of the environment through strip mining on a massive scale of gold and other precious metals in the Orinoco Belt.”



The Venezuelan government also made a statement on Earth Day in April in a bid to bring awareness to climate concerns, specifically overpopulation, the production of pollution, and the conservation of biodiversity, according to Presna Latina. For its part, Venezuela announced it would plant an unspecified number of trees and release two endangered species.Venezuela pledge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2030 at Paris COP21, contingent on financial donations and access to technology from wealthier nations.

A fire broke out at Iran’s largest container shipping port, setting off explosions as oil products perpetuated the blaze, according to the Islamic Republic News Agency.The fire broke out in the facility at the port used for storing oil products.Iran’s Shahid Rajaee port on the Gulf Coast is North of the Strait of Hormuz—a critical chokepoint for oil tankers traveling to a variety of destinations.



INRA reported that the blaze was currently under control per local officials, but that due to the flammable nature of the oil products near the blaze, it is possible that fires will flare up again.The port is critical for Iran, handling 39 percent of all cargo transit in Iran as of 2017, including oil product shipments.Iran’s crude oil exports remain in the spotlight as the United States appears steadfast in its resolve to bring the sanction nation’s oil exports to zero. Oil exports from Iran have fallen to 400,000 barrels per day in May due to the sanctions, which is significantly down from April. In April 2018, Iran exported 2.5 million bpd of crude oil—a far cry from today’s 400,000 bpd.



Reports have surfaced, however, suggesting that this 400,000 bpd might be lower in reality, as Iran attempts to circumvent Washington’s sanctions by turning off transponders, making it impossible to track Iran’s shipments and calculate the total exported. Iran has long insisted that the United States will be unable to bring its exports to zero.Today’s fire could provide some cover for Iran on that point, should oil flows drop further this month. Signs are emerging that the Trump administration may be willing to sit down to the negotiating table with Iran over the nuclear deal with “no preconditions”, showing that the US may be willing to set aside its previous list of demands.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Oil Is On The Brink Of A Bear MarketOil Falls After Sharp Rise In Crude, Gasoline InventoriesBattery Breakthrough Solves Major Electric Car Problem

German energy company Innogy will be seeking partnerships with major oil companies willing to go into renewables for offshore wind projects in the United States, Innogy’s chief operating officer in charge of renewables, Hans Buenting, told Reuters on Wednesday.“Big oil firms are muscling into the market for renewable energy - because their previous business model is finite,” Buenting said.  According to the manager, utilities and oil majors could make good partnerships in offshore wind power installation.“The oil companies may have a lot of experience with platforms out at sea. But — apart from Equinor — they have not built offshore wind farms. That’s where we come in,” Buenting told Reuters.



Equinor aims to have a leadership position in renewable energy development in the U.S. and bought in December 2018 an offshore wind lease off Massachusetts. Equinor also has offshore wind projects in the UK, Germany, and Norway.  Innogy will definitely seek partnerships for large offshore wind projects in the United States, the manager said.Earlier this year, Innogy teamed up with Shell and Stiesdal Offshore Technologies A/S to build a floating foundation wind demonstration project which will be tested offshore Norway in 2020.According to Buenting, the German firm will meet its target to have 500 MW of onshore wind power installed in the U.S. by the end of 2020.Related: Oil Falls After Sharp Rise In Crude, Gasoline Inventories



Last year, Innogy bought the U.S. onshore wind development business of EverPower Wind Holdings for an undisclosed sum. Thanks to the acquisition, Innogy became the sole owner of more than 2,000 megawatts of onshore wind projects in various development stages. The projects are located across eight states that are attractive to renewables—Maine, Maryland, Montana, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Washington, and Wyoming, Innogy said in July 2018.Innogy is still considering whether to bid in a wind lease auction in the New York Bight Region slated for early 2020, Buenting told Reuters. According to the American Wind Energy Association (AWEA), the Department of Energy has estimated that the U.S. could install a total of 22,000 MW of offshore wind projects by 2030 and 86,000 MW by 2050, creating thousands of well-paying jobs in coastal communities.  By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Iran’s Lifeline Against U.S. SanctionsU.S. Scrambles To Find Alternatives For Chinese Rare Earth MetalsThis Giant Oil Field Just Hit An Impressive Production Record

Canadian Solar Inc will supply solar energy to oil and gas pipeline company Energy Transfer from a solar project in the Permian in a first-ever dedicated solar contract that Dallas-based Energy Transfer has signed.Canadian Solar’s wholly owned subsidiary Recurrent Energy has signed a power purchase agreement (PPA) to supply Energy Transfer with solar energy from the Maplewood 2 project in Pecos County in West Texas for a duration of 15 years, the Canadian solar company said in a statement.“Insiders of the renewable energy industry know well that solar PPAs often help corporations lock in low-cost electricity prices to power their operations. However, it is rewarding in 2019 to also see valued partners from the traditional energy sector like Energy Transfer view a purchase of electricity from high quality Canadian Solar assets like the Maplewood 2 project as a financially sensible decision,” Dr. Shawn Qu, chairman at Canadian Solar, said.



According to David Coker, vice president of Power Optimization at Energy Transfer, the PPA makes economic sense for the oil and gas pipeline company.“We are always focused on operating our facilities safely and efficiently, and while we mainly rely on electrical energy powered by natural gas, we do use a diversified mix of energy sources when it makes economic sense to do so. In fact, the percentage of electrical energy we purchase that originates from solar and wind sources is now more than 20 percent on any given day with the addition of this contract with Recurrent Energy,” Coker said.This is not the first time an oil and gas company has signed a power purchase agreement to use renewable energy for its oil and gas operations.



U.S. supermajor Exxon signed in November last year a 12-year deal with Danish renewable energy company Orsted to buy 500 MW of electricity produced by solar and wind farms to power its oil production in the Permian. Although the terms of the contract remained undisclosed, it is the largest such contract featuring an oil company as a party, Bloomberg New Energy Finance commented.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Iran’s Lifeline Against U.S. SanctionsThis Crazy Idea Could Be The Future Of Power GenerationOil Falls After Sharp Rise In Crude, Gasoline Inventories

The first shipment of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Shell’s floating liquefied natural gas (FLNG) facility Prelude offshore Western Australia is imminent, the oil and gas supermajor said on its Management Day 2019 presentation to analysts.“With Prelude now producing LNG for more than a week and the first shipment of LNG being imminent, we are further de-risking the delivery of our $8-10 billion organic free cash flow target in 2020,” Shell’s Integrated Gas & New Energies Director, Maarten Wetselaar, told analysts, discussing the company’s LNG financial performance and targets.“Over the past three years we have consistently been growing both our LNG liquefaction and LNG sales volumes,” Wetselaar said.



It was the LNG business that helped Shell post better-than-expected Q1 earnings, as the trading and natural gas businesses offset weak oil prices and depressed refining margins that plagued the other majors in the first quarter this year.The Prelude FLNG project is the last of the wave of major projects offshore Australia to go online over the past decade, after Total began gas exports from the Ichthys LNG project offshore Western Australia in October last year. LNG projects that began operations in Australia in recent years include Chevron-operated Gorgon and Wheatstone.Australia currently has the world’s largest LNG export capacity, according to the EIA. Over the next few years, Australia, Qatar, and the United States will be competing for supplying more LNG to export markets.



The U.S. Department of Energy has recently authorized additional exports of LNG from the Freeport LNG Terminal in Texas, describing the gas bound for exports as “freedom gas.”According to new production forecasts by Rystad Energy, Australia will become the world’s largest LNG producer in 2020 and will keep that title until 2024, when Qatar will retake the top spot.“Australia has no intention of relinquishing its hard-earned LNG crown without a fight. Over the next two years, pending approvals on up to seven Australian integrated LNG projects could challenge Qatar as the country with the largest sanctioned LNG volumes from integrated projects during that period,” Readul Islam, Research Analyst on Rystad Energy’s Upstream team, said earlier this week.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Iran’s Lifeline Against U.S. SanctionsWorld Bank Reduces Russia 2019 Growth Outlook On Oil CutsOil Falls After Sharp Rise In Crude, Gasoline Inventories

A pipeline capacity shortage caused natural gas flaring and venting to skyrocket to a record high in the first quarter of the year in the Permian, Rystad Energy said in a new report.The average daily rate of flaring and venting reached 661 million cu ft with the research firm noting “This widespread waste of a valuable commodity is the result of persistent infrastructure challenges, a lack of sufficient takeaway capacity and an unexpected outage on a key pipeline in the area.”



The annualized rate of gas flaring in the Permian comes in at 6.8 billion cu m, which is theoretically enough to meet much of the gas demand of whole countries. Together with the Bakken, which is the other flaring hot spot in the United States, oil and gas producers waste so much of the commodity that it exceeds the annual gas demand of certain countries such as Israel, Hungary, and Romania.The good news is that this degree of flaring should fall when the Gulf Coast Express pipeline comes on stream, Rystad’s head of shale research, Artem Abramov, said. Reuters notes that the Gulf Coast Express is scheduled to start operations in October this year and transport up to 2 billion cu ft of natural gas.



The bad news: it is the only new pipeline to come on stream this year. The next large pipeline project in the Permian won’t be operational until late 2020.The pipeline problem of the Permian became obvious last year amid fast-rising production but most of the focus has been on its effect on oil prices. A year ago, total pipeline capacity stood at 3.1 million barrels daily but since then some new capacity has come online, which has mitigated the effect of rising production somewhat. This included an extension to the Sunrise pipeline and the repurposing of the Seminole-Red pipeline to carry crude rather than natural gas liquids. This has perhaps served to worsen the situation with natural gas takeaway capacity.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:China’s Oil Industry Braces For Worst-Case Trade War ScenarioIs Trump Reversing Course On Iran?Saudis Pledge To Rebalance Markets After Price Plunge

The price of liquefied natural gas (LNG) that the United States is exporting to Europe will stay competitive to Russian pipeline gas supplies in the long term, U.S. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry said at a conference in Slovenia on Wednesday.  “This idea that somehow ... LNG can’t compete with pipelined gas is just false,” Reuters quoted Secretary Perry as saying on the sidelines of the conference, as the United States is authorizing additional volumes of LNG exports, calling its LNG “freedom gas.”Commenting on the first LNG shipment from the Cameron LNG Export Facility in Louisiana last week, U.S. President Donald Trump said that “Not only have thousands of JOBS been created in USA, we’re shipping freedom and opportunity abroad!” The downward pressure on LNG prices will continue in the future, and the United States has massive reserves of natural gas, Secretary Perry said in Slovenia’s capital Ljubljana today.



As early as in November last year, U.S. officials and LNG developers said at a gas conference in Berlin that as American LNG costs continue to fall, and as Europe looks to untangle itself from Russia’s Gazprom, U.S. LNG exports are quickly becoming a welcome alternative to Russian gas supplies.  The United States is all too happy to help Europe increase its energy security by diversifying its natural gas supplies—in which Gazprom holds more than a third of the market.Referring to the Russia-led Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, Secretary Perry said today that the United States still has the option of slapping sanctions on the project, but he didn’t go into any details.“We think it’s a bad idea to rely on a single source of energy and that’s basically what you get with the Nord Stream 2, and Europe is seeing first hand that Russia will cut your gas off,” Perry said on Wednesday.   



At the CERA Week in Houston in March this year, Secretary Perry said:“Thanks to innovation…we have more than enough energy to share with the world… and with it comes freedom of choice for energy consumers everywhere…including places where it had never existed.” By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:World Bank Cuts Russia 2019 Growth Outlook On Oil CutsOil Falls After Sharp Rise In Crude, Gasoline InventoriesAustralia Remains Dividend On Roaring LNG Sector

Venezuela’s oil exports slumped in May as the sanctions levied by the United States staunched the flow of oil from the troubled Latin American country that is in the middle of a severe crisis, according to Refinitive Eikon data.Venezuela’s oil exports fell 17% in May to 874,500 barrels per day as it shut down almost all of its crude oil upgraders.A couple of weeks ago, Reuters reported that Venezuela had stopped upgrading crude oil, while leaving a couple of the upgraders running merely to prevent damage to the facilities.



According to Reuters, Venezuela still managed to ship 33 oil and fuel cargoes, most of which went to Asia. India received less crude oil from Venezuela in May, falling to 187,000 barrels per day—down more than 30 percent. China, however, received 450,000 bpd from Venezuela in May, roughly the same level as April shipments as the United States is unable to curb these transactions.The United States sanctions on Venezuela is also unable to stop the flow of crude oil to Cuba. Shipments actually increased to Cuba for the month of May, rising to 91,000 barrels per day from 49,000 barrels per day in April.But Venezuela’s crude oil inventories are dwindling as the upgraders have now stopped—inventory which until now has allowed it to maintain at least some of its oil exports.



United States refineries are struggling to keep their refineries in cheap heavy crude now that US refineries are unable to get their hands on Venezuelan or Iranian heavy crude. Canada, too, is unable to keep the flow of its heavy crude going as wildfires have caused shutdowns in oil-rich Alberta and takeaway capacity constraints persist.Venezuela’s crude oil production fell to 768,000 barrels per day in April.

A day later, the EIA estimated that US inventories had decreased by 300,000 barrels.The net build is still a significant 30.20 million barrels for the 23-week reporting period so far this year, using API data.


Oil prices rose earlier on Tuesday as Saudi Arabia moved to reassure the oil market once again that it would do whatever it takes to rebalance the oil market.

The United States will present in coming days evidence of Iranian involvement in last month’s sabotage of four oil tankers off the coast of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), including intelligence that Washington has received from Israel’s intelligence agency Mossad, Israeli public broadcaster Kan reports.Last month, Saudi Arabia said that two of its oil tankers were attacked by saboteurs near the UAE, while the UAE said that a total of four ships were attacked off its coast at the port of Fujairah, which is the world’s second-largest bunkering port.According to the report in Israeli media, an Israeli navy official said that the attack on the oil tankers offshore the UAE was “a pretty impressive commando operation.”



The U.S. is set to present the intelligence and the evidence it has gathered on the attack to the United Nations Security Council this week, but senior U.S. officials have already pointed the finger at Iran as the ultimate perpetrator of the sabotage against the oil tankers.Ten days ago, the Pentagon accused Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) of sabotaging the four vessels at the Fujairah port.“The attack against the shipping in Fujairah, we attribute it to the IRGC,” Vice Adm. Michael Gilday, Director of the Joint Staff, said on a briefing on Iran on May 24.



The attacks on oil tankers in the Persian Gulf in May were caused by “naval mines almost certainly from Iran,” U.S. National Security Advisor John Bolton said last week while on a visit to the UAE.U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told reporters last week that he had seen the evidence about the tanker attacks that Bolton would present to the United Nations this week.“These were – these were efforts by the Iranians to raise the price of crude oil throughout the world,” Secretary Pompeo said.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Australia Remains Dividend On Roaring LNG SectorOilfield Services Feel The Pain As Crude Prices DropOil Prices Drop As Demand Concerns Weigh On Markets

Three weeks before the OPEC meeting currently scheduled for June 25-26, it looks like the cartel is at odds even about whether this meeting should be held in that particular week, with Iran opposing delaying the summit to the following week.Two weeks ago, reports started circulating that OPEC is delaying the meeting to the first week of July, Warren Patterson, Head of Commodities Strategy at ING, said, quoting Ecuador’s Resources Minister.Now Iran, which is at odds with the Gulf Arab members of OPEC, has told the cartel that it wouldn’t agree to the group postponing the key meeting expected to discuss the fate of the production cut pact expiring at the end of June. Iran’s Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh disagrees with a proposal from OPEC to delay the meeting to early July, Reuters reported on Tuesday, citing a letter that Zanganeh has written to the cartel.



In another letter that Reuters has seen, OPEC says that OPEC member Algeria and non-OPEC producer Kazakhstan also oppose rescheduling the meeting.Earlier this year, OPEC and its non-OPEC partners led by Russia scrapped one extraordinary meeting scheduled for April that was supposed to take stock of the situation of the oil market. A panel of the OPEC+ allies recommended that partners cancel the scheduled extraordinary meeting in mid-April, leaving the decision for the cuts extension for a meeting at the end of June instead.Before scrapping that meeting, OPEC and Russian officials were signaling that mid-April would have been too early to assess the actual impact of the sanctions on Venezuela and the U.S. policy on the waivers for Iranian oil customers, after the waivers expire in early May.



Later in April, the U.S. removed all sanction waivers for Iranian oil buyers, tightening the screws on Iran’s oil exports and leaving OPEC guesstimating how much Iranian supply to the market would further fall amid other supply outages around the world and an uncertain outlook about oil demand.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Shell Vows To Pay Back A Whopping $125 Billion To ShareholdersIs There Really An Oil Shortage?Trump’s Multi-Front War That Spooks Oil Markets

Canada’s largest oil and gas industry organization, the Association of Petroleum Producers, has called on all political parties to include in their election programs support for pipeline projects and devise legislative initiatives aimed at speeding up the construction of such projects.The Canadian Press reports that the CAPP also said in its election wish list that the next federal government could do better by the oil and gas industry, citing chief executive Tim McMillan as saying Canada had lost its competitive edge on the international oil and gas stage as a result of unfavorable policy changes and regulatory updates that have pushed investors away from Canada.



Indeed, a survey by the Daily Oil Bulletin earlier this year suggested that the industry blames both the federal government and the previous government of Alberta for the state the industry is in. As many as two-thirds of the 150 respondents in the survey said they were pessimistic about the immediate prospects of the oil and gas industry, the Daily Oil Bulletin reports, with over a third being very pessimistic. To make the picture even grimmer, only 3 percent said they were very optimistic, with 27 percent expressing some degree of optimism.Addressing the causes for this pessimism, CAPP’s McMillan said, “With global demand at an all-time high and with global demand increasing at near-record rates and global investment following, it is incumbent on the next government to create conditions necessary for Canada’s oil and natural gas industry to succeed and play a key role on the world stage.” 



The sticking point, of course, is the Trans Mountain expansion project. On LNG, there seems to be a lot less opposition, at least from the provincial government that made it its life’s goal to prevent the Trans Mountain expansion from taking place: British Columbia’s NDP government. John Horgan’s ministers are very pro-LNG and recently even passed legislation to incentivize investors to build more LNG export terminals. On Trans Mountain, however, it will be the federal government that will have the last word, expected later this month.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Shell Vows To Pay Back A Whopping $125 Billion To ShareholdersIs There Really An Oil Shortage?Is Trump Reversing Course On Iran?

As many as six Very Large Crude Carriers are loading and due to load crude oil for export at the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port, Reuters reports, citing unnamed sources in the know. The cargoes will be all medium sour grades, which have become increasingly popular among refiners.The reason heavier graders are becoming increasingly popular is a shortage of heavy crude on global markets caused by falling production in sanction-bound Venezuela and Iran. Cuts in heavy crude production among OPEC members under the December 2018 production cut agreement also contributed to tighter supply.One heavy crude grade in the U.S.—Mars Sour, which is produced in the Gulf of Mexico—traded at a premium of as much as US$4.40 to the benchmark contract at the start of this week, Reuters noted.



“We’ve seen very good global demand for medium and heavy sour crude oil,” a Mercuria oil trader told Reuters. In the United States specifically, imports of heavy crude from Iraq, Nigeria, Angola, and Brazil increased last month.Asian refiners are responsible for the bulk of demand growth in this segment. Most Asian refineries are built to process a mixture of light and heavy crude grades to produce fuels and other derivatives.The supply situation is serious enough that Chevron earlier this week asked Washington to extend its sanction waiver for Venezuela, which is one of the largest producers of superheavy oil. The country’s total oil production has fallen sharply—averaging 768,000 bpd in April—and it will fall by another 300,000-400,000 bpd if Washington refuses to extend Chevron’s and others’ sanction waivers.

Oil futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange and Brent crude on the Intercontinental Exchange extended losses in early Tuesday trading, with the U.S. West Texas Intermediate benchmark trading near four-month lows, as investors raise concerns over aggressive U.S. trade policies.WTI, Brent were off to a bad start of a new trading week after the Trump administration threatened to slap tariffs on Mexico over immigration disagreements. The White House announced last week it would slap a progressive 5% tariff on Mexico, with an option of a 5 percentage points increase each month until October, if the country doesn’t stop the flow of illegal migrants into the United States. While Mexico has not responded with retaliatory measures, the country’s top diplomats on Monday rejected an idea of granting asylum status for Central American refugees in Mexico.The Wall Street Journal reported that Trump’s tariffs could hit as much as $360 billion in traded goods and would represent the biggest imposition to date of such duties on a U.S. trading partner. Moreover, Trump’s tariffs will cover sectors not previously involved in the trade war, including crude oil and petroleum products. U.S. – Mexico energy trade accounts for nearly 12% of the total trade between the two countries. U.S. business groups and lawmakers already expressed opposition to the plan, pointing to rising costs for U.S. consumers and diminished corporate profits. Reportedly, the announcement caught many in the White House by surprise, while Trump’s top economic advisor Robert Lighthizer opposed the plan. Oxford Economics estimates U.S. GDP set to decline 0.7% in 2020 if Trump’s tariffs on Mexico are carried out to completion this fall.Investors grew increasingly concerned that U.S. trade policy is used as a tool to gain leverage outside of economic sphere. “It is setting a dangerous precedent, which leave markets wondering what else the tariffs could be used for” said Kristina Hooper, a chief global strategist at Invesco.

China’s officials said the deadlock over trade between the United States and China is unlikely to end anytime soon as it “would be very difficult for the U.S. side to form a powerful and systematic correction of the current policy course”.Goldman Sachs said on Sunday that ""escalating trade wars and weaker activity indicators have finally caught up with oil market sentiment"". Oil futures dropped almost 20% in May, erasing most of the gains from the beginning of the year. ""The magnitude and velocity of the move lower were further exacerbated by growing concerns over strong US production growth and rising inventories,"" Goldman said.

GM and Fiat Chrysler have been funding Tesla by buying greenhouse emission credits from the EV carmaker, according to official filings by the two carmakers to the state of Delaware, as reported by Bloomberg.The report certainly has an ironic twist given Elon Musk’s accusations that large carmakers such as GM and Fiat Chryslers have been trying to prevent Tesla from succeeding in the market. It is similarly ironic for GM and Fiat Chrysler, which have both tried to win some market share from Tesla but without a lot of success.According to Bloomberg, GM no longer needs to buy emissions credits because it sells enough plug-in vehicles. However, these sales are meager in comparison to the sales of its gas guzzlers.



What’s more, the carmaking supermajor is preparing for increasingly tougher environmental regulations by continuing to buy credits from Tesla. These regulations are likely to become particularly tough if next year a Democrat wins the presidential race. A GM spokesperson confirmed this to Bloomberg by saying the company was buying credits as a hedge against “future regulatory uncertainties.”“Until demand catches up with regulatory requirements and there is regulatory relief,” Eric Mayne said, “we will use credits as appropriate.”According to Bloomberg, Tesla’s revenues from emission credit sales since 2010 have reached some US$2 billion, with the main market contributing to this being its home one in California. It is the biggest car market in the United States and it also has probably the most stringent emission rules requiring carmakers to sell a number of zero-emission vehicles that is proportional to their market share in the state. If they can’t make the necessary number of sales, they are obliged to buy emission credits from a “cleaner” carmaker.



A report by the Environmental Protection Agency earlier this year said most carmakers in the U.S. had complied with the emissions regulation in 2017, most of them did so with the help of credit purchases.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:OPEC+ Has Only One Choice As Oil Prices SlideIs Trump Reversing Course On Iran?China-Made Tesla Sells In 3-Minute Blitz

Wildfires in Canada are sending Canadian oil prices higher as a second oil producer is forced to shut-in production, with Cenovus Energy joining Canadian Natural Resources in halting operations due to safety concerns, according to World Oil.Over the past year, Canada’s oil industry has suffered under the weight of its deeply discounted benchmark crude oil, Western Canadian Select. The painful discount, worsened by Canada’s provincial bickering over oil flows and pipeline projects, pressured oil-rich Alberta last year curtail oil production in an effort to shore up the discount. It worked.In October 2018, the WCS discount was over $60.



That discount fell to just $15 last week, and is now looking to shrink even further thanks to the wildfire.The wildfires bring back painful memories of wildfires ripping through Alberta in 2016, crippling multiple producers and shutting in hundreds of thousands of barrels of production. The total estimated cost of those fires were $1 billion. The wildfire damage was so far reaching, that it affected global oil prices as well.



The latest wildfire has so far claimed just the two producers. The first of which is Canadian Natural Resources LTD (NYSE: CNQ), which has seen a drop in stock price of 1.44% to trade at $26.60. Cenovus Energy Inc. (NYSE: CVE) was trading down 1.71% at $8.06.Canadian Natural Resources have stopped 65,000 barrels daily of heavy crude oil—a resource that at the moment is already constrained as Venezuela’s crude oil production—which is of the heavy variety—has dropped to new lows. Iran’s oil too—also heavy—is also being restricted.US Gulf refineries are configured to process his heavy crude oil, which is becoming increasingly difficult (or increasingly expensive) to find, and driving season is now underway. Most refineries ramp up production for driving season, but the global shortage of heavy crude oil—made worse by the wildfires—will surely cut into refinery margins.

The amount of crude oil making its way from OPEC member countries to the North America dropped in 2018 to an average of 2.813 million barrels per day—a drop of 406,000 barrels per day, or a 12.6-percent decrease from 2017, according to cartel’s 2019 Annual Statistical Bulletin published on Monday.OPEC’s crude oil exports to Europe also declined, from 4.654 million barrels per day to 4.577 million barrels per day.



OPEC’s overall exports, however, were up overall, although modestly. OPEC crude oil exports for 2018 reached an average of 24.67 million barrels per day—an increase of just 14,000 barrels per day, or a 0.1-percent increase. The largest chunk of OPEC’s crude oil exports—64.3 percent—makes its way to the Asia and Pacific region.OPEC’s proven crude oil reserves fell by 0.2% to 1.189 trillion barrels at the end of 2018, according to OPEC’s latest figures. Meanwhile, the United States’ crude oil reserves rose from 39 billion barrels to 47 billion barrels. Latin America, Eastern Europe and Eurasia, Africa, and the Middle East all saw small dips in their crude oil reserves.



Saudi Arabia’s crude oil reserves were pegged at 267 billion barrels, a slight increase from the 266 billion barrels estimated for 2017.Overall, the world’s total crude oil production in 2018 “increased sharply” according to the cartel, estimating it at 75.78 million barrels per day—a 1.213 million barrel per day increase from 2017---the highest annual growth since 2015. This, despite the OPEC agreement to curb production for 2018. The top producers club includes the United States at an average of 10.53 million barrels per day, Russia at an average of 10.53 million barrels per day, and Saudi Arabia at an average of 10.32 million barrels per day.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Trump’s Multi-Front War That Spooks Oil MarketsCan This Former Oil Giant Become Energy Independent?The OPEC Outcast Fighting For LNG Dominance

Chinese refiners are not rushing to finalize deals for oil cargoes from West Africa for August, expecting prices of crude grades from Angola to drop from recent highs as the global oil benchmark slumped and the market structure points to weakening premiums for prompt deliveries, Reuters reported on Monday, quoting refining and trading sources in Asia.China’s refiners are currently in the market looking for supplies for August, but they are not jumping to close deals because the Brent Crude backwardation—the market situation in which front-month prices are trading at a premium compared to prices further out in the future—has sharply narrowed, pointing to possible weakening of the spot prices, industry sources told Reuters.  Sources at Chinese refineries told Reuters that the differentials of West African crudes are still very high, making imports unprofitable.



In addition, refining margins in Asia have been recently pressured and dropped to their lowest in 16 years, with refiners across the region said to be considering cutting run rates.Although refiners in Asia are not left without choice for crude after the end of the U.S. sanction waivers for Iranian oil, the higher price of alternative supplies, as well as soaring fuel exports from China, are depressing refining margins across Asia.Chinese refiners, for their part, have been stocking up on crude oil in the first half of this year, so there would probably be a slowdown in oil imports in the third quarter, Seng Yick Tee with Beijing-based consultancy SIA Energy told Reuters.



Last week, sellers of Angolan and Nigerian crude grades started to reduce offers for cargoes in July because high shipping costs to Asia had been discouraging buyers, trade sources told Reuters.Because buyers in Asia have not been pleased with the high prices of cargoes from Angola, the offers of Angolan grades—both heavy and light crudes—were revised down by between US$0.20 and US$0.30 a barrel last week, according to trade sources who spoke to Reuters.

Enbridge’s Line 3 pipeline replacement project ran into another unsurprising roadblock on Monday after a Minnesota State Court of Appeals ruled that its environmental assessment just wasn’t good enough.The ruling is a reversal of Minnesota Public Utilities Commission’s decision that approved the environmental impact statement for the pipeline replacement.The project plans to replace Enbridge’s existing 282 miles of 34-inch pipeline with 337 miles of 36-inch pipe. The appellate court found today that the Commission erred when it approved the plan, and found that Enbridge’s environmental impact statement lacked in specificity, specifically where it deals with oil spills in relation to Lake Superior.



The new Line 3 would have the capacity to move 370,000 barrels of oil per day, alleviating the takeaway capacity constraints that Canada is facing. Line 3 is one of two pipeline projects in the works that are—in their unfinished state—keeping Canada’s oil industry from reaching its potential.Line 3 has faced numerous legal challenges and has been approved and disapproved several times over.Enbridge has pushed back its startup date, which was originally supposed to be at the end of 2019. The latest date given, prior to today’s loss, was in H2 2020.



Enbridge Inc. (NYSE: ENB) was trading down on the unfavorable news at $35.53 per share (-3.64%).Enbridge is also struggling to get its Line 5 replacement project in Michigan off the ground. The company is in talks with Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer on how to proceed. One option being considered is shutting the aging Line 5.Meanwhile, oil is still flowing through both of the aging lines—a real concern as aging pipelines come with a higher risk of leakages.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Saudis Pledge To Rebalance Markets After Price PlungeIt’s Adapt Or Die For U.S. RefinersThe Bad Gas Deal That Brought Down A Prime Minister

Venezuela needs a broad national movement that would include the military and the opposition to bring down Nicolas Maduro peacefully and restore the crippled oil industry, a former Venezuelan oil minister who has fallen out of favor with Maduro told Al Arabiya English in an exclusive interview published this weekend.  “I think we need to agree on some kind of national compromise to defeat Maduro and to heal the country,” Rafael Ramirez, who has long been a rival of Maduro within Hugo Chavez’s inner circle, told Al Arabiya.Ramirez ran Venezuela’s state oil company PDVSA for ten years between 2004 and 2014. In May last year, Ramirez—who lives in exile—told Bloomberg that PDVSA was on the cusp of total collapse and expected oil production to drop by 600,000 bpd each year amid lack of investment.



One year later, the economic crisis has deepened, and Venezuela’s production has plunged to below 1 million bpd, but Maduro is holding onto power months after the United States and many other western countries recognized opposition leader Juan Guaidó as the country’s interim president.“The way to resolve the political situation is to ask for a huge national movement that includes the military, the opposition, the Chavistas in order to confront and defeat Maduro,” Ramirez told Al Arabiya. “People live in a state of fear and hopelessness under a governing political gang that refuses to enable a political solution to the very serious crisis facing our country. They have led our homeland into a deep abyss,” the former oil minister and PDVSA boss said.



With the political standoff and raging economic crisis, gasoline production in Venezuela—the country sitting on the world’s largest oil reserves—has slumped as the second-largest refinery in the country stopped operating, and gasoline import shortages have caused lines at gas stations.The military is overseeing the rationing of fuel while shortages begin to bite deeper as crude oil production continues to fall, refineries operate much below capacity, and the flow of diluents necessary to produce fuels from Venezuelan superheavy crude dries up. By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Saudis Pledge To Rebalance Markets After Price PlungeTrump’s Multi-Front War That Spooks Oil MarketsChina’s Oil Industry Braces For Worst-Case Trade War Scenario

Amid tightening supply of heavy oil on global markets Chevron is asking the Trump administration for sanction relief in Venezuela so it could continue doing business there, Bloomberg reports quoting sources close to the company, noting that the U.S. supermajor is currently operating under sanction waivers that expire in late July and is hoping for an extension.Chevron, together with Venezuela’s PDVSA, operates the Petroboscan joint venture, in which it holds a 39-percent stake. Like PDVSA’s other JVs, Petroboscan suffered production outages earlier this year after a series of blackouts hit Venezuela. The country’s total oil production has fallen sharply—averaging 768,000 bpd in April—and it will fall by another 300,000-400,000 bpd if Washington refuses to extend Chevron’s and others’ sanction waivers, according to an energy analyst who spoke to Bloomberg.



“The Trump administration will have to reconcile that volume with the value of maintaining a strong U.S. foothold in the country,” David Voght from IPD Latin America said.The United States slapped new sanctions on Caracas in January, after the inauguration of Nicolas Maduro for a second term as president. The U.S. decried the elections as illegitimate and threw its support behind opposition leader Juan Guaido. Despite Guaido’s active efforts to undermine the incumbent government with the help of Washington, Maduro has proved hard to remove despite continuing protests and Guaido’s takeover of Citgo, Venezuela’s U.S. business.



As one of the few major suppliers of heavy crude, Venezuela has become the main contributor to a shortage of this sort of crude that has seen many refineries—including ones in Asia and the U.S. Gulf Coast—take a hit on margins. The tightening supply of heavy crude also saw some heavy grades trade at a premium to lighter crudes in a reversal of the traditional price differences, which are in favor of light crude.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Trump’s Multi-Front War That Spooks Oil MarketsIt’s Adapt Or Die For U.S. RefinersThe OPEC Outcast Fighting For LNG Dominance

Argentina’s state oil and gas company YPF is loading the country’s first-ever export cargo of liquefied natural gas, Reuters reported, citing a company statement.“This is the first step of a process that YPF is leading to export and expand gas markets to the world,” a company vice president said.



The cargo is the equivalent of 30,000 cubic meters and its sale is being handled by U.S. LNG major Cheniere Energy. The destination, however, has not been revealed.The gas for the cargo was extracted from the coveted Vaca Muerta shale play—one of the world’s largest shale formations and Argentina’s great energy hope. Called “the Argentine Permian”, and the play that can turn Argentina from a net importer of oil and gas into a net exporter. According to Argentine government estimates, the Vaca Muerta could double the country’s oil production to 1 million bpd by 2023, with natural gas production rising to 260 million cubic meters daily.



YPF has estimated liquefied natural gas exports alone could bring in more than US$200 million. This would constitute a tenth of the company’s overall export revenues. According to plans, LNG will be exported during the summer season when local demand is at its lowest since Argentina is not yet producing enough gas for both domestic consumption and exports on a year-round basis.Billions of dollars have been poured already into the Vaca Muerta, which could be the world’s second-largest gas deposit, but return is slow to come because of the lack of infrastructure in the area, which is boosting the cost of pretty much everything from frac sand to moving the output to export markets. Legislative changes have also affected the profitability prospects of operators in Vaca Muerta and have slowed down its development, with several companies postponing their investment plans for the area.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Trump’s Multi-Front War That Spooks Oil MarketsIt’s Adapt Or Die For U.S. RefinersThis Oilfield Services Company Is Significantly Undervalued

Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE: MRO) has completed its divestiture of its Kurdistan assets on Friday, according to company press release, as it seeks to divest nearly all its oil operations overseas to focus on operations in the United States.Marathon Oil held a 15% stake interest in the Atrush Block in the Kurdistan region in Iraq, and represents its only holding in the country.While the project was a small one, netting 2,400 barrels of oil equivalent per day, the exit is reflective of Marathon’s bigger push to shore up its business in the United States, exiting 9 total countries since 2013. The tenth country that Marathon will exit is the United Kingdom, which is expected to close in the second half of 2019 when RockRose Energy will purchase Marathon Oil’s stake in Marathon Oil UK LLC and Marathon Oil West of Shetland Limited—projects that combined generated 13,000 barrels per day.



Marathon Oil has also exited Libya—an oil hotpot that has been a headache for foreign oil companies due to the civil unrest.The plan is for Marathon Oil to invest more heavily back home, pouring billions into the Eagle Ford, the Bakken, STACK/SCOOP in Oklahoma, and the Permian. Marathon’s US-based production for Q1 2019 came in at 388,000 boep/d, versus 426,000 boe/d in Q1 2018.Marathon has plans to allocate 60 percent of its 2019 capital to the Eagle Ford and Bakken plays, and 40% to the northern Delaware (in the Permian) and Oklahoma plays, with more of the capital being allocated to the more mature assets, and caution being exercised in the Permian where the current pipeline constraints create complications, according to Marathon Oil CEO Lee Tillman in an interview with the Houston Chronicle earlier this month.

US-led forces have blown up three oil tankers in Syria as the United States increases its pressure on Syria by thwarting the oil trade between the PKK/YPG and the Assad regime, according to local sources quoted by several media sources.The strike was carried about by coalition planes, which hit three oil tankers, leaving four dead. The coalition has not yet made a statement about the attack. In the area controlled by Assad, oil consumption stands at around 136,000 bpd. Production, meanwhile, is only 24,000 barrels per day. This means that the regime must import significant volumes of crude oil at an estimated expense of more than $2 billion per year.



The attack comes a couple weeks after the EU extended its sanctions on the Assad regime for one year after the Syrian regime upped the ante in repressing the Syrian people, bringing the Syrian crisis to a boiling point.Reports surfaced weeks ago that Iran had resumed oil shipments to Syria in the wake of US sanctions on the former, with a million barrels arriving in Syria from Iran on May 5. Further illicit oil shipments may be coming, as a new border crossing between Iraq and Syria is currently under construction, Fox News reported last week, based on satellite imagery revealing that construction is underway.



In Syria, Arab residents of oil-rich Deir Ezzor area began protests in April against US-backed Kurdish forces that control the region to the East of the Euphrates. The protests disrupted the oil flows from nearby fields, most of which have been controlled by the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces since the end of 2017.The fuel and electricity shortages that are occurring now in Syria have soured previous supporters of Assad against his rule. Iran, who has poured billions into Syria to prop up the Assad regime in recent years, is now feeling US pressure on both fronts—one at home as its oil exports are restricted, and another in Syria.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:The No.1 Reason Why Investors Are Shunning Energy StocksShale Drillers Keep On Falling Into The Same TrapChina's Biggest Weapon In The Trade War

Although refiners in Asia are not left without choice for crude after the end of the U.S. sanction waivers for Iranian oil, the higher price of alternative supplies, as well as soaring fuel exports from China, are depressing refining margins across Asia.Asian oil buyers haven’t had problems in procuring alternate supplies of  crude oil to their usual cheap Iranian supplies, but the barrels replacing Iran’s oil come at higher prices that hurt the profits of refiners across Asia, Reuters columnist Clyde Russell wrote on Friday.



Adding to the loss of Iranian crude, another factor weighing on the refining margins at Asian refiners is the soaring exports to the region of refined oil products out of China, which has been boosting its refining capacity this year.Last week, reports emerged that persistent pressure on profit margins has forced Asian refiners to start considering a reduction in their run rates as Asia’s refining margins slipped to a 16-year low. Higher international oil prices were behind the unfavorable development, which has seen refiners’ margins drop to the lowest since the spring of 2003, according to Reuters data.



Earlier this month, China issued a new batch of oil product export quotas and they are 5.3 percent higher than they were this time last year as the country’s refineries return to processing record-high amounts of crude oil.The refining margins across Asia could continue to be depressed in coming months because trade sources expect that Saudi Arabia, the world’s top oil exporter and the main beneficiary of the U.S. sanctions on Iran, will further raise the prices of the crude grades it sells in Asia for July, thanks to strong prompt demand amid tighter oil supply due to the U.S. sanctions on Venezuela and Iran. The official selling prices (OSPs) of Saudi Arabia’s oil, announced at the start of each month for deliveries for the next month, typically set the trend of crude pricing of the other oil producers from the Persian Gulf.

The Arab countries of the Persian Gulf expressed solidarity with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), supporting all measures that their two allies take to protect their security and interests in the wake of what they called “terrorist attacks carried out by the Houthi terrorist militias” on oil interests in the region.Two pumping stations along Aramco’s East-West oil pipeline in Saudi Arabia were attacked by explosive-laden drones earlier this month, a day after the UAE said that a total four vessels were attacked off its coast at the port of Fujairah, the world’s second-largest bunkering port.The GCC Supreme Council condemned both attacks, saying that these terrorist acts are a threat to regional security and the global economy.



The attack on four commercial vessels off the UAE coast is a “dangerous escalation that threatens the security and safety of maritime navigation in this vital region of the world and negatively affects regional and international peace and security as well as stability of oil markets,” the Gulf Arab states said at the end of an extraordinary summit on Friday in a joint statement carried by the Saudi Press Agency. The Gulf Arab states directly pointed the finger at Iran, and said that “Iran must stop supporting, financing and arming terrorist militias and organizations as well as feeding sectarian conflicts.”“The Council denounces the Iranian threats to the freedom of maritime navigation and oil supplies, calling upon on the international community to shoulder its responsibilities in securing the freedom of maritime navigation, in light of these threats and attacks against the United Arab Emirates and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,” the statement reads.



The attacks on oil tankers in the Persian Gulf earlier this month were caused by “naval mines almost certainly from Iran,” U.S. National Security Advisor John Bolton said on Wednesday from the UAE as the tension between the U.S. and Iran continued to escalate.U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told reporters on Thursday that he had seen the evidence about the tanker attacks that Bolton would present to the United Nations next week.“These were – these were efforts by the Iranians to raise the price of crude oil throughout the world,” Secretary Pompeo said.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Shale Drillers Keep On Falling Into The Same TrapChina's Biggest Weapon In The Trade WarSentiment Vs.

North Korea’s leader Kim Jong Un executed his top negotiator and other officials, after charging them with spying for the United States as part of a “brutal” purge after the failed summit with the U.S. earlier this year, South Korean newspaper Chosun Ilbo reported on Friday, citing a source.The U.S. and North Korea failed to make any progress in the summit in Hanoi in February, with the U.S. demanding denuclearization while Pyongyang wanting sanctions relief first.Shortly after the failed summit, North Korea’s top nuclear envoy in the talks before the summit, Kim Hyok-chol, was shot dead at the Mirim Airport in March, alongside four other senior officials, on charges that they had spied for the United States, Chosun Ilbo reports today.



Kim Jong Un’s former right-hand man, Kim Yong-chol, was sent to a labor and re-education camp, while other officials and the interpreter for North Korea’s leader at the summit were sent to political prison camps, according to Chosun Ilbo’s source.According to a diplomatic source who spoke to Reuters, there have been signs that some of the above-mentioned officials have been sent to camps, but no evidence was available showing that some had been executed.The U.S. is trying to check the information of the report, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said at a news conference while in Berlin on Friday.



At the February summit, North Korea was demanding some relief from the sanctions before committing to steps to denuclearization, as UN sanctions are choking off its energy supply.North Korea’s nuclear and ballistic missile program remains intact while the country continues to defy UN resolutions with significantly increased illegal ship-to-ship oil and coal transfers, a UN Panel of Experts wrote in an annual report in March. North Korea is using increasingly advanced and inventive techniques to evade the oil sanctions, including manipulation of vessel AIS transmission systems, physical disguise of tankers, illegal name-changing and other forms of identity fraud, night transfers, and the use of additional vessels for transshipment, the panel of experts said.North Korea is also reportedly looking to renewable and other alternative energy sources as it is unable to procure enough oil, coal, fuel, and diesel under the UN sanctions.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Floods Threaten America’s Largest Oil HubOil Prices Plunge On U.S.-China Trade War EscalationPeace And Oil: Trump’s Endgame In Saudi Arabia

The United States will sanction any country that tries to buy Iranian oil after the sanction waivers expired on May 2, regardless of whether said country had reached its negotiated cap under the exemptions, the U.S. Special Representative for Iran, Brian Hook, said, clarifying earlier comments that resulted in speculation that the U.S. would allow countries that hadn’t reached their cap of Iranian imports to continue buying oil from Iran until they reach that cap.  “Our firm policy is to completely zero out purchases of Iranian oil -- period,” Hook told Bloomberg News in a statement on Thursday.“Any new purchases of oil initiated after the expiration of the SREs [significant reduction exceptions] on May 2 will be subject to U.S. sanctions, even if a country had not met its previously negotiated purchase caps during the SRE period from November to May 2.”



Hook’s comments came after remarks he made earlier on Thursday in a press briefing in which he said:“And so once people have reached that cap of what was negotiated during that period that then would be the limit of the oil that we would permit to move through that would not be sanctioned. We will sanction any efforts to import Iranian crude oil beyond the limits that were negotiated in the period that ran from November through May.”Those remarks led to speculation, with the Wall Street Journal reporting that countries that hadn’t reached their negotiated cap under the waiver period could be able to continue buying Iranian oil without risking sanctions until they reach that limit.



After the U.S. removed all sanction waivers for Iranian oil customers, Iran’s oil exports are estimated to have plunged to 400,000 bpd in May— which is less than half of Iranian oil exports in April.  Earlier this week, reports emerged that India plans to immediately begin negotiations with Iran to pay in rupees for Iranian oil to bypass U.S. sanctions.

A series of explosions in Iraqi oil hotpot Kirkuk has killed at least five people and injured 18 more, medical sources reported to Reuters on Thursday. No one has claimed the attacks yet, although the Islamic State is active in the area.Today’s explosions were preceded a rocket strike a bit over a week ago as tensions flare in the area, creating security concerns for the oil industry and foreign personnel.Earlier in May, the United Sates evacuated all non-essential personnel from Iraq citing security concerns stemming from Iran in a level 4 travel advisory. The announcement prompted US-based oil behemoth Exxon to review its security measures and begin removing engineering personnel from the country. Iraq confirmed at the time that Exxon had removed all of its foreign employees, or about 60 staff.



Iraq was quick to condemn Exxon for the hasty retreat, accusing Exxon of having motives other than security concerns for the personnel evacuation. While Exxon’s removal of its personnel from the West Qurna 1 oilfield in Basra did not disrupt production according to Iraqi officials, Iraq threatened legal measures for Exxon’s actions.Today’s explosions were not thought to disrupt oil production in Iraq, instead targeting malls, an ice cream shop, and a butcher’s shop. The unrest in Iraq may have an indirect effect on its oil industry, however, in that it may look less appealing to oil investors and oil companies who would otherwise be interested in Iraq’s oil industry.Iraq is OPEC’s second largest producer, pumping 4.630 million barrels per day as of April, according to OPEC’s Monthly Oil Market Report. Other oil companies operating in Iraq include Eni, Rosneft, CNPC, CNOOC, Gazprom, and Lukoil.



The unrest in Iraq comes at a rather precarious time as Iraq is looking to seal the deal with Exxon and PetroChina over a $53 billion project that would generate some $400 billion of the 30-year deal period.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Shale Drillers Keep On Falling Into The Same TrapChina's Biggest Weapon In The Trade WarSentiment Vs.

When it comes to the Democrat presidential hopefuls toeing the party line on climate change, Joe Biden is near the back of the pack, Greenpeace has concluded.On Greenpeace’s most recent presidential scorecard released Thursday, Joe Biden was graded at a sorry D-, making Biden the second-worst ranked democrat candidate seeking a 2020 term as President of the United States.The only Democrat candidate that was ranked more poorly was John Hickenlooper Jr., a candidate who has in the past urged his party to keep from veering too far to the left, warning them that it should put a bit of distance between itself and socialism. If not, Hickenlooper said, “we’re going to end up reelecting the worst president this country’s ever had.” Hickenlooper has also not been very supportive of the Green New Deal—a prime factor in determining a candidate’s placement on the Greenpeace list.Greenpeace’s ranking was based on answers to two questions that were posed to the presidential candidates. The first was about their support for the Green New Deal. The second was about the candidate’s support for replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy sources.As part of the older Democrat establishment, Biden has not officially endorsed the Green New Deal that is enthusiastically supported by the younger Democrats such as AOC.

The UK’s crude and natural gas liquids (NGL) production increased by 9 percent annually to reach 1.18 million bpd in the first quarter of 2019, S&P Global Platts quoted statistics from the UK Department of Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy as showing on Thursday.  The UK’s crude oil production alone increased by 11 percent to 1.08 million bpd in Q1, according to the government statistics quoted by Platts—a welcome sign for the UK oil and gas industry which has managed to reverse a years-long downward trend in recent months, thanks to start-ups of projects in the North Sea.  According to the UK Department of Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy, provisional figures for 2018 showed that UK crude oil and NGL production rose by 8.9 percent compared to 2017, mainly due to multiple new projects on the UK Continental Shelf (UKCS) coming online in late 2017 and 2018 and increasing production through the year.



In November of 2018, BP and its co-venturers started up production at the giant Clair Ridge project in the West of Shetland region offshore UK. The project is targeting 640 million barrels of oil reserves and is expected to have peak production of 120,000 bpd.The UK’s petroleum reserves remain at a significant level, with overall remaining recoverable reserves and resources ranging from 10 to 20 billion barrels plus of oil equivalent, according to the UK Oil and Gas Authority (OGA). Currently proven and probable reserves on the UKCS can sustain production for another 20 years.The UKCS yielded 20 percent more oil and gas in the last five years after 14 consecutive years of production declines, the industry’s association, Oil & Gas UK, said in its latest annual Business Outlook earlier this year.



Exploration in the UK’s North Sea is definitely picking up and this year could see the drilling of up to 15 new wells, the association added. This is momentum that needs to be maintained, the association noted, as expectations were for another decline in production to begin after 2020.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilrpice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:China's Biggest Weapon In The Trade WarThe Single Biggest Challenge For The Oil & Gas IndustryWhy Bears Will Win The Oil Price War

Refuting reports that he had made more than US$2 billion in compensation from Tesla last year, Elon Musk said on Twitter on Wednesday that Tesla was “actually net negative comp for me.”The New York Times reported last week rankings compiled by executive compensation consulting firm Equilar, which showed that Elon Musk was the highest-paid CEO of 2018.  “The pay package Tesla promised to Elon Musk was so large, we had to add an extra dimension to the chart below to display it accurately,” the Times said, showing a chart that Musk made nearly US$2.3 billion in 2018, mostly from options.According to the chart, Musk made more than the next 65 CEOs on the list combined.



Early last year, Tesla said that Musk’s compensation as CEO for the next 10 years would be contingent on the electric vehicle maker achieving ambitious performance targets, including raising its market capitalization by nearly US$600 billion.“Elon will receive no guaranteed compensation of any kind - no salary, no cash bonuses, and no equity that vests simply by the passage of time. Instead, Elon’s only compensation will be a 100% at-risk performance award, which ensures that he will be compensated only if Tesla and all of its shareholders do extraordinarily well,” the EV maker said.Referring to the reported compensation for 2018, Musk replied to a Twitter user on Wednesday “Yeah, the fear, uncertainty & doubt propaganda campaign being pushed by those betting against Tesla has reached new heights.”After the NYT report, a Tesla spokesperson wrote in a statement to Business Insider:



“Elon actually earned $0 in total compensation from Tesla in 2018, and any reporting otherwise is incorrect and misleading. Unlike other CEOs, Elon receives no salary, no cash bonuses, and no equity that simply vests by the passage of time.”Related: The No.1 Reason Why Investors Are Shunning Energy StocksOver the past few days, a number of analysts have expressed doubts about Tesla’s ability to deliver on sales and financial performance and not burn all the cash it has.

Hong Kong officials rejected on Wednesday warnings from the U.S. that the autonomous city could face sanctions if it does business with an oil tanker carrying Iranian oil in breach of the U.S. sanctions on Iran.  Hong Kong is strictly enforcing United Nations sanctions which don’t have “any restrictions on the export of petroleum from Iran,” a spokesperson for Hong Kong’s Commerce and Economic Development Bureau told Bloomberg, answering a question about the U.S. warning.  Earlier this week, the United States urged Hong Kong to be on the lookout for an oil tanker carrying Iranian oil presumably that may be on its way to China, in violation of U.S. sanctions against the Middle Eastern country.Dismissing the U.S. warning, the spokesperson told Bloomberg on Wednesday:  



“Certain countries may impose unilateral sanctions against certain places on the basis of their own considerations.”“Those sanctions are outside the scope of the UN Security Council sanctions” that Hong Kong is abiding by, according to the Hong Kong official.The oil tanker, known as the Pacific Bravo (formerly Silver Glory), was originally headed to Indonesia, Refinitive Eikon data showed, according to Reuters, but changed course on Monday to head toward Sri Lanka.The Pacific Bravo flies under the Liberian flag, but a senior US official claims the oil tanker is owned by China’s Bank of Kunlun, which is the official handler of money between China and Iran. Bank of Kunlun is owned by CNPC’s financial arm, CNPC capital.



“Anyone who does business with this ship, the Pacific Bravo, would be exposing themselves to U.S. sanctions,” the senior official said, adding that the US will “enforce our Iran sanctions quite aggressively and quite consistently.”China has historically been Iran’s largest crude oil customer, although Beijing has significantly increased its crude oil purchases from Saudi Arabia since the onset of U.S. sanctions on Iran.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Oil Prices Flat On Minor Crude DrawThe No.1 Reason Why Investors Are Shunning Energy StocksShale Drillers Keep On Falling Into The Same Trap

Democratic Senator Edward Markey warned the White House on Wednesday not to interfere with climate science, after a report emerged earlier this week that the Trump Administration was considering excluding the worst-case emissions scenario from a report on the impact of climate change on the United States and its economy.Senator Markey, who is chair of the Senate Climate Change Task Force and member of the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, sent on Wednesday a letter to the White House office responsible for monitoring the drafting of the National Climate Assessment “asking the White House to explain why it is interfering with the climate science activities of the federal agencies.”Earlier this week, the New York Times reported that the Trump Administration is considering providing models on the impact of climate change only though 2040, not until the end of this century, as U.S. administrations have previously done in the National Climate Assessment report. The National Climate Assessment report is a Congressionally mandated report that has been prepared every four years since 2000.



According to scientists who spoke to the New York Times, excluding models after 2040 would be misleading because the direst effects of the global warming will be felt after that.“Political interference cannot be permitted to suppress the work of our scientists. I’m demanding answers on the Trump administration’s reported efforts to exclude information about the worst impacts of climate change from the next National Climate Assessment,” Senator Markey tweeted on Wednesday.“Any political interference into the climate science that underpins this report could have a chilling effect on the scientific research going forward and could potentially put American lives and property at increased risk by understating the urgency of climate action,” he said in his letter to the director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy.



Excluding the highest-emission scenarios would “artificially and unjustifiably understate the risks that climate change presents to the United States, and would misinform federal and state action taken in response to this threat,” Senator Markey said.   By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads from Oilprice.com:Shale Drillers Keep On Falling Into The Same TrapChina's Biggest Weapon In The Trade WarFloods Threaten America’s Largest Oil Hub

The American Petroleum Institute (API) reported a large draw in crude oil inventory of 5.265 million barrels for the week ending May 24, coming in over analyst expectations of a 857,000-barrel drawdown in inventories.Last week, the API reported the latest in a string of surprise builds in crude oil inventories, the last of which was 2.4 million barrels. A day later, the EIA estimated that US inventories had increased by 4.7 million barrels.Even with this week’s draw, the net build is still a significant 26.65 million barrels for the 22-week reporting period so far this year, using API data.To compare, this is what the graph looked this this same week in 2017:



Oil prices rose briefly on Wednesday as news that flooding might impact oil flowing near Cushing, Oklahoma. But news of the escalating China/US trade dispute pushed prices lower, with WTI falling $0.31 (-0.52%) to $58.83, with Brent falling $0.80 (-1.16%) to $67.87 by 2:58pm EST. Prices continue to remain volatile in the wake of mounting tensions in the Middle East, supply disruptions in Venezuela and Iran, and the US/China trade dispute.Both benchmarks are trading significantly down on the week.The API this week reported a build in gasoline inventories for week ending May 24 in the amount of 2.711 million barrels. Analysts estimated a draw in gasoline inventories of 528,000 barrels for the week.Distillate inventories fell by 2.144 million barrels for the week, while inventories at Cushing fell by 176,000 barrels.



US crude oil production as estimated by the Energy Information Administration showed that production for the week ending May 17 rose slightly to 12.2 million bpd from the all-time high of 12.3 million bpd achieved during the week of April 26.The U.S. Energy Information Administration report on crude oil inventories is due to be released on Thursday at 11:00a.m. EST due to the Memorial holiday.By 4:45pm EST, WTI was trading down at $59.07 and Brent was trading down $68.07.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Russia Considers Accepting OPEC Cuts ExtensionRenewables Investment To Overtake Oil & Gas In AsiaPeace And Oil: Trump’s Endgame In Saudi Arabia

The US Department of Energy has authorized additional exports of domestically produced natural gas from the Freeport LNG Terminal in Texas, according to a DOE press release from Tuesday, but the press release is garnering additional attention for its coining of the phrase “freedom gas” when referring to this LNG.“Increasing export capacity from the Freeport LNG project is critical to spreading freedom gas throughout the world by giving America’s allies a diverse and affordable source of clean energy. Further, more exports of U.S. LNG to the world means more U.S. jobs and more domestic economic growth and cleaner air here at home and around the globe,” US Secretary of Energy Mark Menezes said at a Clean Energy Ministerial in Canada this week as cited in the press release.The press release further uses the phrase “molecules of U.S. freedom” in referring to the fossil fuel.



The use of the phrase in the quirky press release was quickly bandied about on Twitter.While likening natural gas to freedom managed to raise some eyebrows, the onslaught of US LNG exports to other countries will provide alternate sources of the fuel to countries who may otherwise have a single—or limited—supply choice.Regardless of whether you call it LNG or freedom gas, US LNG is taking the world by storm, with the US FERC approving in April two LNG projects including the Tellurian’s Driftwood LNG terminal and pipeline in Louisiana, and Sempra Energy’s Port Arthur LNG facility in Texas. Both of these projects are set to deliver first LNG in 2023. But that’s not all. As many as ten additional LNG projects are still in the queue waiting for FERC approval.



US LNG export capacity is set to double by end 2019 from end 2018, reaching 8.9 billion cubic feet per day. This would make the United States the third largest LNG exporter in the world behind Australia and Qatar, according to the EIA.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Floods Threaten America’s Largest Oil HubOnly 10% Of U.S. Shale Drillers Have A Positive Cash FlowPeace And Oil: Trump’s Endgame In Saudi Arabia

The attacks on oil tankers in the Persian Gulf earlier this month were caused by “naval mines almost certainly from Iran,” U.S. National Security Advisor John Bolton said on Wednesday from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) as the tension between the U.S. and Iran continues to escalate.Earlier this month, Saudi Arabia said that two of its oil tankers were attacked by saboteurs near the UAE, while the UAE said that a total four vessels were attacked off its coast at the port of Fujairah, which is the world’s second-largest bunkering port. Speaking to reporters in Abu Dhabi on Wednesday, Bolton said, as carried by Reuters:“I think it is clear these (tanker attacks) were naval mines almost certainly from Iran.”



“There is no doubt in anybody’s mind in Washington who is responsible for this and I think it’s important that the leadership in Iran know that we know,” the U.S. national security advisor said.  A few days ago, the Pentagon accused Iran’s Revolutionary Guard of sabotaging four vessels at the Fujairah port.“The attack against the shipping in Fujairah, we attribute it to the IRGC,” Vice Adm. Michael Gilday, Director of the Joint Staff, said on a briefing on Iran on Friday. Iran immediately rejected Bolton’s “absurd claim”, Iranian media report.



“It is not surprising to see Bolton make such a ludicrous claim in a meeting with two members of a team with a long track record of anti-Iran policies,” Iranian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Abbas Mousavi said today, quoted by the Mehr news agency.Iran is blaming what it calls a ‘B-team’—comprised of Bolton, Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, and Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan—for plotting anti-Iranian “destructive policies.”“[T]he strategic patience, high vigilance and full defensive readiness of the Islamic Republic of Iran” will prevent “Bolton and other warmongers and crisis-seekers” “from hatching their sinister plots to cause chaos in the region,” Iran says.  By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Floods Threaten America’s Largest Oil HubNuclear Power Dying A Slow DeathWhy EVs Can’t Do Without Oil

U.S. Devon Energy announced on Wednesday an agreement to sell its Canadian business to Canadian Natural Resources for C$3.8 billion, or US$2.8 billion, as part of its plan to focus on growing its oil production in the United States.As part of the exit from Canada, Devon Energy will sell its heavy oil assets, most of which are located in Alberta, with net production averaging 113,000 oil-equivalent barrels in Q1 2019. Proved reserves at Devon’s assets were around 409 million barrels of oil as of end-2018.In February this year, Devon Energy said that it would be looking to sell its Canadian assets to become a high-return U.S. oil growth business in what analysts described as a ‘long-overdue’ announcement from the U.S. oil company.



Back then, various analysts expected a wide range for what a potential price tag for Devon’s Canadian assets would be—those ranged from as low as US$2.6 billion (C$3.5 billion) to as high as US$6.66 billion (C$9 billion). The deal with Canadian Natural Resources announced today is expected to close by the end of this quarter and is contingent upon customary terms and conditions, Devon Energy said in a statement.Devon Energy will use the proceeds from the Canadian asset sale to cut its debt.



“This transaction creates value for our shareholders by achieving a clean and timely exit from Canada, while accelerating efforts to focus exclusively on our high-return U.S. oil portfolio,” Devon Energy’s president and CEO Dave Hager said.For Canadian Natural Resources, the acquisition of Devon’s Canadian assets is a good fit to its current asset portfolio.“These high quality assets complement our existing asset base and provide further balance to our production profile, while not increasing the need for incremental market access out of western Canada, as it is already existing production,” Canadian Natural’s President Tim McKay said in a statement.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Peace And Oil: Trump’s Endgame In Saudi ArabiaThe Second Machine Age Could Crash Oil PricesThe Next LNG Boom Will Dwarf The Last One

Subsidies for the fossil fuel industry should be eliminated as they help to “destroy the world” the United Nation’s Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told media this week, adding pollution should be taxed, as quoted by Reuters.""Many people still think that to give fossil fuel subsidies is a way to improve living conditions of people,"" Guterres said at a climate change conference in Austria. ""There is nothing more wrong than that. What we are doing is using taxpayers' money – which means our money – to boost hurricanes, to spread droughts, to melt glaciers, to bleach corals. In one word – to destroy the world.""Global fossil fuel consumption subsidies, including for electricity generation, exceeded US$300 billion in 2017, according to data from the International Energy Agency released in its 2018 World Energy Outlook.



Of this, Iran accounted for the biggest portion, at US$45 billion, followed by China, with subsidies of about US$38 billion, and Saudi Arabia, which poured around US$35 billion in oil gas, and electricity subsidies in 2017, Russia came fourth, with about US$21 billion allocated for fossil fuel subsidies.Related: The Single Biggest Challenge For The Oil & Gas IndustryMeanwhile, the pressure to curb the worst effects of climate change on the environment is intensifying. Earlier this month a fresh report warned that up to a million animal and plant species faced extinction as a result of human activity. The report, however, blamed industrial farming and fishing for the crisis rather than singularly focusing on the energy industry as many others have. Yet, it said that fossil fuel use made matters worse.



In response to this report, the UN’s Secretary-General called for ""a rapid and deep change in how we do business, how we generate power, how we build cities, and how we feed the world"". This is by far not the first—nor will it be the last—call for a complete makeover of human civilization. The thing about complete makeovers is they don’t happen overnight however much you want them to. That’s why now some have estimated that even if all governments that ratified the Paris Agreement do what they pledged to do, temperatures will still rise by an average 3 degrees Celsius from pre-industrial times.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Russia Considers Accepting OPEC Cuts ExtensionThe Second Machine Age Could Crash Oil PricesPeace And Oil: Trump’s Endgame In Saudi Arabia

Russia may join a proposed extension of the oil production cuts agreed with OPEC at the end of last year, First Deputy Oil Minister Anton Siluanov told Reuters today. The most important issue to consider is what the oil price gains would be from an extension as opposed to the potential loss of market share to U.S. producers.“There are many arguments both in favor of the extension and against it,” Siluanov said, adding “Of course, we need price stability and predictability, this is good. But we see that all these deals with OPEC result in our American partners boosting shale oil output and grabbing new markets.”The December 2018 agreement between OPEC, Russia and several other smaller producers aimed to reduce global supply by 1.2 million bpd to prop up stubbornly low prices. However, after the cuts did their job and prices rose, the United States removed sanction waivers for eight large Iranian oil importers, prompting a price rise. This combined with lower production in Venezuela and the continued threat of outages in Libya to push prices higher.



Saudi Arabia was the first to mention the possibility of extending the production cuts beyond their original end-June expiry as it strives for even higher oil prices despite the danger of market share loss. In fact, the Kingdom has been boosting its market share in Asia as refiners need a quick replacement for lost Iranian barrels.Earlier this month, it emerged that several OPEC members were in favor of extending the production cuts to the end of the year for fear that prices will drop sharply if the cuts are ended in June.There are some grounds for this fear: the latest escalation between China and the U.S. has renewed the worry about a global economic slowdown that will dampen oil demand, and U.S. production continues to push higher, capping the bullish potential for benchmarks.

After the U.S. ended all sanction waivers for Iranian oil customers on May 2, Iran’s crude oil exports have been significantly down this month compared to April and more than 2 million bpd off their 2.5-million-bpd peak in April 2018, just before the U.S. withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal and moved to re-impose sanctions on Iran’s oil industry.According to industry sources and tanker-tracking data cited by Reuters on Wednesday, Iran’s oil exports this month have plummeted to 400,000 bpd, which is less than half of Iranian oil exports last month.The United States had given eight countries six-month waivers to continue buying oil from Iran after the U.S. re-imposed sanctions on the Iranian oil industry in November. The United States, however, pursued a maximum pressure campaign against Iran last month and put an end to all sanction waivers for all Iranian oil buyers, beginning in May.



Most of the Iranian oil shipments are going this month to Asia, according to tanker tracking data from Refinitiv Eikon and to two industry sources.One of the sources told Reuters they expected Iran’s average oil shipments this month to be around 400,000 bpd, but the other source noted that exports could hit 500,000 bpd.Related: Renewables Investment To Overtake Oil & Gas In AsiaSome of Iran’s oil exports are believed to have been already under the radar as Iran is said to have increased the use of the ‘switch-off-the-transponder’ tactic, which makes tracking its exports via the AIS systems increasingly difficult and opaque.



Earlier this month, Iran was spotted resuming illicit shipping of oil to Syria, with a million barrels of oil arriving in early May, for a first such delivery since the start of this year. Experts believe that Iran will be re-opening and using more of its illicit oil channels to keep oil trade and continue getting some revenues from its most precious export commodity.The inability to fully track Iran’s oil supply is making OPEC and allies’ task to asses global supply to the market increasingly difficult, as opaque data about Iran adds to mounting uncertainty over oil supply disruptions elsewhere, clouding OPEC’s outlook on global supply for the rest of this year.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:The Second Machine Age Could Crash Oil PricesPeace And Oil: Trump’s Endgame In Saudi ArabiaThe Single Biggest Challenge For The Oil & Gas Industry

Tanzania has announced that construction will finally begin on its much-delayed LNG plant in 2022, Tanzania’s energy minister said on Tuesday according to Reuters—the latest in Tanzania’s goalpost moving for the massive LNG project.The news comes side by side another important announcement for Tanzania—that of its oil pipeline that will move oil between Tanzania and Zambia, the latter of which imports most of its petroleum that it uses.The $30 billion LNG plant has experienced significant delays due to regulatory issues to determine the legal, fiscal, and commercial terms for the project, as well as low LNG prices. Major international companies have been exploring for gas offshore Tanzania, including Equinor, Exxon, and Shell and have found sufficient quantities for a potential LNG plant.



 The LNG plant is planned for the Lindi region, and will be spearheaded by Shell, Exxon, Ophir, and Pavilion, with an expected completion date of sometime in 2028. The plant will have a 10 million tonnes per annum capacity, the energy minister said, and will open up avenues for Tanzania to export its LNG.Tanzania has stated in the past that it was eager to “beat Mozambique to secure markets in Japan and South Korea.” If Mozambique were to beat Tanzania to market, this project could be worthless, Tanzania’s previous energy minister said in 2017.The LNG project was originally supposed to have reached an agreement with international companies sometime in 2018.



For the oil pipeline, the project is expected to cost $1.5 billion, the energy minister said, according to Reuters, although the details for this project have not yet been made available, including when the project will begin, and how it will be financed, other than it is expected to be a joint project between Zambia and Tanzania.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Rare Earth Metals: China’s ‘Nuclear Option’ In The Trade WarPentagon Accuses Iran Of Tanker SabotageHave Gasoline Prices Peaked For 2019?

India is Iran’s second-largest crude oil purchaser.



While India and China may be bold enough to thumb their noses at US sanctions on Iran’s crude oil, they may have difficulty finding willing insurers and shipping companies to do the same.Iran has been consistently adamant that the United States would be unable to drive its oil exports to zero, and has engaged in covert shipments of oil and fuel, including forging documents to subvert the United States’ plan to restrict its oil exports.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Rare Earth Metals: China’s ‘Nuclear Option’ In The Trade WarPentagon Accuses Iran Of Tanker SabotageHave Gasoline Prices Peaked For 2019?

Tankers carrying gasoline and ships transporting food for Venezuela were sabotaged last week to prevent them from reaching Venezuela, Nicolas Maduro said in a televised speech late on Monday.“Last week, sabotage was committed against ten tankers [with gasoline] to prevent them from reaching the Venezuelan coast,” Russian news outlet Sputnik quoted Maduro as saying.Amid political chaos and a raging economic crisis, Venezuela’s oil production has been crumbling, and most refineries and upgraders have stopped producing entirely, operating at zero capacity merely to keep the facilities from being damaged as its buyers look for alternate supplies in the face of US sanctions.



Venezuela, the country sitting on top of the world’s largest crude oil reserves, is now producing less than 1 million bpd of oil - just over 750,000 bpd in April, compared to average production of 1.9 million bpd for 2017, as per OPEC’s secondary sources.While Maduro and opposition leader Juan Guaidó, recognized as the country’s interim president by the U.S. and many other countries, vie for Venezuela’s presidency, the tightened U.S. sanctions on Venezuela that began in February are constraining Venezuela’s ability to produce, refine, and export oil. Venezuela’s gasoline production has slumped as the second-largest refinery in the country stopped operating, and gasoline import shortages have caused lines at gas stations.Related: Oil Majors Are Missing The Renewable Boom In AsiaThe military is overseeing the rationing of fuel while shortages begin to bite deeper as crude oil production continues to fall, refineries idle, and the flow of diluents necessary to produce fuels from Venezuelan superheavy crude dries up.



Meanwhile, Norway’s government said on Saturday that representatives for Maduro and Guaidó would hold another round of talks mediated by Norway.“We announce that the representatives of the main political actors in Venezuela have decided to return to Oslo next week to continue a process facilitated by Norway,” the Norwegian government said on May 25.“We reiterate our commitment to continue supporting the search for an agreed-upon solution between the parties in Venezuela,” Norway said.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:The Single Biggest Challenge For The Oil & Gas IndustryThis Oilfield Service Player Is Looking To Make A ComebackRare Earth Metals: China’s ‘Nuclear Option’ In The Trade War

Nigeria’s government has authorized a local oil company to operate a new floating crude oil export terminal off the coast of the Rivers state in the oil-rich but still troubled Niger Delta.Belemaoil Producing Ltd has been allowed to moor a floating storage and offloading (FSO) unit and use it as a crude oil export terminal, according to a letter signed by the Director of Nigeria’s Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR), Mordecai Ladan, Nigerian media report.The new terminal, which will be known as Belemaoil Terminal Kula, is expected to create more than 10,000 jobs and other opportunities for the unemployed youths in the area, according to Samuel Abel-Jumbo, External Relations Manager at Belemaoil.



Not all local communities in the Niger Delta have been happy with the major international oil companies operating in their region, and Nigeria’s oil industry has frequently suffered sabotages, oil theft, vandalism, and militant attacks on infrastructure.Nigeria, Africa’s largest oil producer and an OPEC member, is dusting off an ambitious plan to double its oil production by 2025, aiming to pump as much as 4 million bpd in six years’ time—a goal that analysts think may be too ambitious for the country to achieve.Nigeria currently pumps around 2.2 million bpd in crude oil and condensate. In April, Nigeria’s crude oil production alone stood at 1.819 million bpd, up by 92,000 bpd from March, according to OPEC’s secondary sources.



Nigeria may have a hard time achieving its ambitious oil production goal because of security concerns and the continuous oil theft and resulting oil spills in the Niger Delta that have been affecting the operations of supermajors like Shell and Exxon.At the end of last month, sabotages and oil leaks led to several operators declaring force majeure on key oil export grades, including Shell declaring force majeure on Bonny Light exports, which was lifted more than two weeks later.

Tesla already sells Model 3 on the Chinese market, at prices starting at US$54,600 (377,000 yuan), its website shows. Currently all Tesla cars sold in China are made in the United States and then shipped to China, which adds logistics costs, import tariffs, and the risk of additional tariffs if the trade war further escalates. The imported Tesla vehicles are not eligible for subsidies either.Tesla has started the construction of a production facility in the world’s top EV market in order to be able to compete on a level playing field with a growing number of local EV manufacturers. As a U.S.-made vehicle, Tesla’s cars in China have been subject to steep tariffs, and sales have suffered from the U.S.-China trade war.In January this year, Elon Musk joined the mayor of Shanghai for the groundbreaking ceremony of Tesla’s first factory outside the U.S. and in the world’s largest electric vehicle (EV) market, China.



Tesla aims to finish the initial construction of the Shanghai Gigafactory this summer, begin production of Model 3 by the end of this year, and reach high volume production next year, Musk wrote on Twitter on the day of the event.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Have Gasoline Prices Peaked For 2019?Norwegian Oil Patch Ramps Up Spending To Counter DeclineWhy Bears Will Win The Oil Price War

Occidental Petroleum hasn’t closed the acquisition of Anadarko yet, but analysts are already speculating about which Anadarko assets Occidental could divest to cut part of the debt it has taken on from the transaction and to focus on the core assets after the deal—Anadarko’s prime U.S. shale acreage.  The sooner Occidental delivers on its non-core asset sales, the sooner it can start consolidating complementary assets with Anadarko to achieve synergies and regain some favor with investors, shareholders, and the market, mergers and acquisitions (M&A) analysts and bankers tell Reuters.When Oxy announced earlier this month that it had entered into a deal to buy Anadarko—outbidding Chevron—Occidental said it “expects to reduce debt over the next 24 months through free cash flow growth, realizing identified synergies and executing a planned portfolio optimization strategy with $10-15 billion of divestitures over the next 12-24 months; $8.8 billion of which has already been agreed through the transaction with Total.”



The deal with Total, however, may not go as smoothly as initially expected, after Algeria’s Energy Minister Mohamed Arkab said over the weekend that the North African country would not allow Total to acquire Anadarko’s assets, because Algeria’s government had not been consulted on the matter and is now ready to exercise its pre-emption right.Algeria quickly came down off that stance, with its energy minister acquiescing enough to say it was open to a “good compromise” for a Total/Anadarko deal, according to S&P Global Platts.Related: Have Gasoline Prices Peaked For 2019?According to analysts who spoke to Reuters, Occidental’s most likely asset sales could be Anadarko’s pipeline business and the assets in the Gulf of Mexico. Anadarko’s GoM position may be worth at least US$6 billion, and potential buyers could be some of the biggest players with experience in the Gulf of Mexico such as Exxon, Shell, Chevron, and Total, analysts tell Reuters.



If the deal with Total for Anadarko’s African assets goes through and Oxy sells the offshore assets, it would likely reach its US$10-15 billion asset sale target, Matt Sallee, portfolio manager at Tortoise Capital Advisors, told Reuters.When Occidental approached Anadarko in late April with a bid countering Chevron’s, rating agency Moody’s said that the proposed deal would add almost US$40 billion of debt to OXY's capital structure. Moody’s placed OXY under review for downgrade, noting that if the acquisition closes and crude oil prices remain supportive, “OXY would likely emerge from the review with a weakly positioned investment grade rating.”By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:This Troubled Nation Just Made A Critical Gas DiscoveryNorwegian Oil Patch Ramps Up Spending To Counter DeclineWhy Bears Will Win The Oil Price War

The retirement of old nuclear power plants in the coming years could compromise the international effort to arrest the rise in global temperatures and result in an increase in carbon emissions instead, the International Energy Agency has warned in a new report.Nuclear is one of the lowest-emissions sources of energy but it has a bad reputation, which has prompted Germany, for example, to greatly reduce its operating nuclear capacity and replace it with renewables and, mostly, natural gas. France also had an idea to start phasing out the nuclear plants that supply more than two-thirds of its electricity but it seems common sense has temporarily prevailed. The start of the phase-out that should bring the share of nuclear in its energy mix from 75 percent to 50 percent was moved from 2025 to 2035.



Even so, the IEA says, “Without policy changes, advanced economies could lose 25% of their nuclear capacity by 2025 and as much as two-thirds of it by 2040.” This comes at a time when coal capacity is also being reduced fast because of emission concerns while wind and solar additions are stalling. If the share of nuclear drops as much as the IEA estimates based on the current situation, the planet could suffer as much as 4 billion tons of carbon dioxide in additional emissions.Related: Renewables Investment To Overtake Oil & Gas In AsiaInterestingly enough, the authority believes that extending the life of existing nuclear power plants is a good way to prevent these additional emissions from materializing. Although cost-intensive, this extension is actually competitive with the addition of more solar and wind generation capacity. This would certainly come as a surprise to some energy industry insiders in the United States where the nuclear industry has been struggling to keep afloat in the face of cheap natural gas.



The alternative to life extension and construction of new nuclear power plants is, of course solar and wind. However, it won’t be as easy as some would like to believe.As per the IEA, “If other low-carbon sources, namely wind and solar PV, are to fill the shortfall in nuclear, their deployment would have to accelerate to an unprecedented level. In the past 20 years, wind and solar PV capacity has increased by about 580 gigawatts in advanced economies. But over the next 20 years, nearly five times that amount would need to be added. Such a drastic increase in renewable power generation would create serious challenges in integrating the new sources into the broader energy system.”By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Pentagon Accuses Iran Of Tanker SabotageIs The Oil Glut Coming Back?Rare Earth Metals: China’s ‘Nuclear Option’ In The Trade War

After India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi won the country’s elections, the government will immediately begin negotiations with Iran to pay in rupees for Iranian oil to bypass U.S. sanctions, Indian news outlet ThePrint reported on Tuesday, citing two government sources.India, Iran’s second largest oil customer after China, was one of the eight countries that were granted six-month waivers to continue buying oil from Iran after the U.S. re-imposed sanctions on the Iranian oil industry in November. The United States, however, pursued a maximum pressure campaign against Iran last month and put an end to all sanction waivers for all Iranian oil buyers.This put Indian refiners in a position to source the market for alternatives, and many of them, especially private companies, did, because they are wary of possible secondary U.S. sanctions if they continue to buy oil from Iran.



India’s Ambassador to the United States, Harsh Vardhan Shringla, said last week that India had officially ended all oil imports from Iran, but India has said that it would review its decision to stop buying Iranian oil once the elections are over.After Modi won the elections, the government is now keen to discuss non-dollar payments and steps that would allow it to resume purchasing oil from Iran, according to ThePrint’s sources.India is keen to resume imports from Iran, although the quantity may be limited, a senior government official told ThePrint, adding that Iran’s Pasargad Bank, which has been authorized to open a branch in India, could be used for the payments.



“Payments can be deposited in the Iranian bank and then Iranian authorities can decide how to utilise the money,” the official told ThePrint.Talks with Iran were held before the elections, but were stalled until the elections end and results come in. Discussions will resume and this will be one of the top priorities of the Indian government, according to the official.India and Iran, however, must also find a way to cover insurance for the oil tankers because many international shipping companies steer clear of any involvement with Iranian tanker insurance due to the U.S. sanctions on Iran, one official said.

After the surprising conservative win in Australia’s recent general election, the new Energy Minister, Angus Taylor, has claimed the majority government formed with the Liberals had a mandate to implement climate policies.“We’re firmly committed to the policies we took to the election. We now have a clear mandate to implement those policies and we’ll be doing so,” Taylor told the Sydney Morning Herald today, adding There's now an opportunity for a bipartisan approach to energy and emissions. Labor should adopt our plan, which was supported by the Australian people, and I know industry wants to see bipartisanship. Now's the opportunity.""



While Taylor said his ministry will strive to deliver both cheaper energy to Australian households and climate change targets, he also said the government will not renew the National Energy Guarantee initiative proposed by the previous government and later dropped amid the government crisis.The National Energy Guarantee aimed to combine lower emissions with lower prices and with supply security by obliging energy companies to first make sure they have a constant minimum supply of electricity regardless of what they use to generate it—including solar and wind— and second, to guarantee that the emissions resulting from the production of this electricity are in line with the country’s Paris Agreement commitment.



Not everyone is a fan of this approach, including provincial governments as well as industry groups, although some industry groups were vocally in favor of the plan last year. In any case, it seems it won’t be returned to the table under this government.Electricity supply has become a serious problem in Australia in recent years. The previous government blamed it on the fast adoption of solar and wind capacity without any backup or storage to prevent blackouts. Another serious problem is a looming LNG shortage due to excessive exports, which is also contributing to higher electricity prices and lower security of supply.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Why Bears Will Win The Oil Price WarThe Biggest Losers In The Shale SlowdownRenewables Investment To Overtake Oil & Gas In Asia

Iraq’s Basra Provincial Council is calling on the Iraqi government to take Exxon to task over its decision to evacuate its engineers from its West Qurna oilfield in the Basra province.Although the council said that Exxon’s evacuation did not disrupt overall production in Basra, Anwar Mudalal, a member of the Council, said that “the Minister of Oil, however, should take legal procedures against the company because it has violated its contract with Iraq,” according to basnews.



Mudalal added that most of the oilfields in Basra are managed by Iraqi officers, and not foreign personnel, thus its resilience to the shocks of a major player such as Exxon pulling its engineering staff out of country—an action that Iraq’s Oil Minister Thamer Ghadhban claimed was “unacceptable and unjustified.”ExxonMobil began to evacuate its engineers working on Iraq’s West Qurna 1 field a couple weeks ago after the United States ordered the evacuation of all non-essential government employees from Iraq citing security concerns, warning that the US embassy in Iraq would suspend visa services and would have a “limited ability to provide emergency services to US citizens in Iraq.”



Despite Exxon’s untimely departure, Iraq promised just days later that it would raise the oil production from its giant West Qurna 1 field by as much as 50,000 barrels per day. Currently, the West Qurna 1 oil field pumps around 440,000 bpd. Iraq’s plan is to increase that production to 490,000 bpd.The news that Exxon was beginning to remove some engineering personnel from the country came at a rather delicate time as Iraq, PetroChina, and Exxon were rumored to be close to signing a $53-billion oil deal that would create a $400 billion windfall for Iraq over the 30-year period of the deal.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Pentagon Accuses Iran Of Tanker SabotageSaudi Oil Exports To China See Spectacular JumpNorwegian Oil Output Set To Fall To Lowest Level In Three Decades

Israel suggested on Monday that it is open to United States-mediated negotiations with Lebanon over a long-standing dispute over a maritime border—and if talks are successful, oil and gas exploration in the eastern Mediterranean could receive much needed easing of the tension and positive regulatory and political climate for oil and gas companies.Lebanon—which shares the Levant Basin in the eastern Mediterranean with Israel, Cyprus, and Syria—has been far behind Israel and Cyprus in exploring and developing its share of resources due to political impasse over the past few years, and a dispute with Israel over Lebanon’s southern maritime border.Lebanon and Israel have an unresolved maritime border dispute over a triangular area around 860 square kilometers (332 square miles) that extends along the southern edge of three of Lebanon’s 10 blocks.



The Lebanese-Israeli dispute is a long-standing one, but tensions rose again early last year after Lebanon called an oil and gas exploration tender in disputed territory.In February 2018, reports emerged that a U.S. mediation between Lebanon and Israel in their dispute over offshore oil and gas blocks and maritime borders had failed.Now, according to a statement from the office of Israel’s Energy Minister Yuval Steinitz carried by Reuters, Israel was open to talks with Lebanon mediated by the U.S. The statement came after Steinitz met with U.S. Acting Assistant Secretary at the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs, David Satterfield.



Those talks could be “for the good of both countries’ interests in developing natural gas reserves and oil,” Reuters quoted Steinitz’s office as saying in a statement.Neither Lebanese nor U.S. officials have immediately commented on the possibility of such talks.Last month, Lebanon said that it planned to include five offshore blocks in a future bidding round for oil and gas exploration. Four of those blocks lie along disputed maritime borders—two claimed by Israel and two by Syria.  By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Rare Earth Metals: China’s ‘Nuclear Option’ In The Trade WarPrivate Equity Scrambles To Buy Assets In This Emerging Oil & Gas HotspotPentagon Accuses Iran Of Tanker Sabotage

The Nigerian unit of Royal Dutch Shell doesn’t have any plans to return to exploring or producing oil in Ogoniland in Nigeria’s Rivers state after it ceased operations there in the 1990s, Igo Weli, General Manager, External Relations, at the Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC) said this weekend at the release of Shell Nigeria’s 2019 Briefing Notes.SPDC, as operator of the SPDC Joint Venture, carried out exploration and production operations in Ogoniland from the 1950s until the early 1990s. Production ceased in 1993 following a rise in violence, threats to staff, and attacks on facilities, Shell said.Shell is being dragged through the courts over its alleged complicity in abuses of human rights in Nigeria’s military suppressing protests in the oil-rich Niger Delta in the 1990s, especially in the Ogoniland area.  



The SPDC joint venture has produced no oil or gas in Ogoniland since 1993, although one of Niger Delta’s main pipelines, the Trans-Niger Pipeline (TNP), passes through Ogoniland. Shell’s Nigerian unit transferred operatorship of the JV’s assets in Ogoniland to the Nigerian Petroleum Development Company (NPDC), the production and exploration arm of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), in 2012.Last November, Amnesty International called on Nigeria, the Netherlands, and the UK to start investigations into Shell “over its role in a swathe of horrific crimes committed by the Nigerian military government in the oil-producing Ogoniland region in the 1990s.”Related: Pentagon Accuses Iran Of Tanker SabotageIn the early 1990s, the Ogoni people in the Niger Delta protested against the pollution in their land coming from oil operations, and those protests were crushed by the Nigerian military. Shell has always denied claims that it has been involved in any way in these events.



Earlier this month, a Dutch court ruled that it had the jurisdiction and would hear a damages lawsuit against Shell brought by the widows of activists executed by Nigeria’s government after the protests in Ogoniland in the 1990s.“The women believe their husbands would still be alive today were it not for Shell’s relentless pursuit of profit, which encouraged the Nigerian government’s bloody crackdown on protesters even when it knew the deadly human cost. Shell might now face questioning in a court of law about what they knew and how they contributed to this horrifying event in Nigerian history,” Mark Dummett, Amnesty International’s Head of Business and Human Rights, said, commenting on the court ruling from May 1.

One of the big OPEC producers, Kuwait, expects the oil market to rebalance toward the end of this year on the back of declining inventories and healthy oil demand, Kuwait’s Oil Minister Khaled al-Fadhel told Reuters on Monday.OPEC is on the right track on its mission to draw down swelled inventories, but the work is not yet done, said the oil minister of Kuwait, which currently pumps around 2.7 million bpd and is the cartel’s fourth-largest producer behind Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).“But we still have some more work to do. I believe the market is expected to be balanced during the 2nd half of 2019, more towards the end of the year,” al-Fadhel told Reuters in written replies to questions.



However, it’s too early to say if OPEC and its allies will decide to extend next month their production cut agreement through the whole of 2019 because there are many uncertainties both on the demand and supply side, the minister said.The demand-side uncertainties include the U.S.-China trade dispute and its impact on the global economy and oil demand growth. On the supply side, U.S. production continues to increase, but fears of more supply outages from Iran and Venezuela, along with the instability in Libya, clouds the outlook for the oil market balance in the near term, al-Fadhel told Reuters.“All options are on the table,” the minister said in response to a question if OPEC and its allies could decide at the meeting next month to increase production in the second half of 2019. Related: This Oilfield Service Player Is Looking To Make A Comeback



Reports have it that OPEC and its partners may decide to keep the production cuts until the end of the year as the cartel fears a steep price drop if cuts were to be reversed within the next couple of months, according to delegates at a panel meeting of the extended producers’ club who spoke to The Wall Street Journal.Saudi Arabia’s Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih told Reuters last week that he doesn’t see an oil supply shortage on the market currently. OPEC will be responsive to the market needs, al-Falih said, but reiterated that data still suggests that inventories are rising, especially in the United States.The EIA’s latest inventory report showed last week a crude oil inventory build of 4.7 million barrels in the week to May 17, sending oil prices lower.    By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Is The Oil Glut Coming Back?Rare Earth Metals: China’s ‘Nuclear Option’ In The Trade WarPrivate Equity Scrambles To Buy Assets In This Emerging Oil & Gas Hotspot

After nearly a decade of delays, South Africa has just joined some 40 countries that have enacted national carbon tax policies, aiming to curb the rise in carbon emissions to meet global climate change targets.South Africa’s President Cyril Ramaphosa signed on Sunday the carbon tax act that will introduce a carbon tax on June 1 in one of Africa’s worst polluters. In the first phase of the tax implementation—June 2019 through December 2022—the tax rate will be equal to US$8.32 (120 South African rand) per one ton of carbon dioxide equivalent.  The second phase of the carbon tax will be between 2023 and 2030, according to a statement of South Africa’s National Treasury.



In the first phase, allowable tax breaks will effectively slash the carbon tax to between US$0.42 (6 rand) and US$3.33 (48 rand) per ton of CO2 equivalent, according to the treasury.“A review of the impact of the tax will be conducted before the second phase and will take into account the progress made to reduce GHG [greenhouse gas] emissions in line with our National Determined Contribution,” the treasury said in a statement, carried by Reuters.South Africa, which continues to rely heavily on coal, has been considering introducing a carbon tax since 2010, but has delayed the implementation at least three times because state utility Eskom and mining companies have argued that a carbon tax would raise electricity prices while it would erode providers’ profits.Related: Oil Rig Count Falls Amid Oil Price Correction



Eskom generates 90 percent of its electricity from coal, according to Global Risk Insights. South Africa aims to diversify its energy mix toward cleaner energies, sourcing 42 percent of its energy demand from renewable sources by 2030. Labor unions, however, oppose a significant scale-down in coal dependency, fearing massive job losses in the coal industry amid high unemployment in the country, Global Risk Insights says.By enacting the carbon tax, South Africa joins some 40 countries and more than 20 cities, states, and provinces that already have carbon pricing mechanisms, World Bank data shows.Still, climate activists say South Africa’s commitments are far from compatible with keeping global warming in check. According to Carbon Action Tracker, South Africa’s commitments fall in the “highly insufficient” category, meaning that if all government targets were in this range, global warming would reach between 3 and 4 degrees Celsius.  By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Is The Oil Glut Coming Back?Rare Earth Metals: China’s ‘Nuclear Option’ In The Trade WarThis Oilfield Service Player Is Looking To Make A Comeback

Algeria will not allow French Total to acquire Anadarko’s assets in the North African country, Energy Minister Mohamed Arkab told media on Sunday, as quoted by Reuters.The deal for the acquisition—valued at US$8.8 billion—was made by Total and Occidental petroleum during the bidding war with Chevron for Anadarko. The deal was contingent on Oxy winning that war, which it did in early May.However, Algeria’s government had not been consulted on the matter and is now ready to exercise its pre-emption right, according to Arkab.



“Our ministry has contacted Anadarko to get explanations on this information, but so far we got no answer,” he said. “It means there is no contract between Total and Anadarko ...We have good relations with Anadarko and we will do the utmost to preserve Algeria’s interests, including using our pre-emption right to block the sale.”Total already has a presence in Algeria and last year it signed a series of new agreements with Algeria’s Sonatrach for the development of new fields. However, as Reuters points out, Algerian-French relations are not the friendliest after the bloody independence war in Algeria from the 1950s.For Total, however, the acquisition of Anadarko’s portfolio in Algeria, which totals some 260,000 bpd, is a “perfect fit” with its priorities, CEO Patrick Pouyanne said earlier this month.Related: Tainted Russian Oil Crisis May Drag On For Months



“What we tell to investors is we play to our strengths. What are the strengths of Total? It is the Middle East, Africa, North Sea, Deep Water. ... It is just fitting exactly and perfectly with what we announced,” Pouyanne said commenting on the deal with Occidental.“In fact...we have been looking at these assets more than a year. We have had some discussions before with Anadarko. It was not a lot of creativity to fix that these assets are not very well fitting for upstream and that there was a potential match between Oxy and Total.”The share in Algerian production that the Anadarko assets account for is more than a quarter: Algeria pumps about a million barrels daily.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Is The Oil Glut Coming Back?Private Equity Scrambles To Buy Assets In This Emerging Oil & Gas HotspotRare Earth Metals: China’s ‘Nuclear Option’ In The Trade War

The Trans Mountain oil pipeline was handed a win on Friday when a British Columbia court ruled that the provincial government could not legally restrict crude oil flowing through it, according to the Court of Appeal for British Columbia website.While Trans Mountain still faces an uphill battle in a climate that is cooling to crude pipelines, Friday’s win is good news for the project and good news for the Canadian government, who purchased the Trans Mountain pipeline last year when it became clear that Trans Mountain had stalled and needed a push. The push, in that the government purchased the project, proved insufficient to definitively move the project along.



Instead, the project has languished in pipeline purgatory as Canada’s federal government, BC, Alberta, indigenous groups, and environmentalists continue to wage war over the controversial project.Trans Mountain is a crucial oil project for Canada and is expected to almost triple the amount of oil flowing from Alberta to the coast in British Columbia. Canada, which has struggled to get its oil to market thanks to takeaway capacity constraints, has seen the price of its benchmark, Western Canadian Select, trade at a steep discount to WTI, prompting mandatory production cuts to keep the prices higher.



Today’s ruling by the BC court definitely put the Trans Mountain pipeline under federal jurisdiction. In its judgement, the summary read:“On a constitutional reference by the Province of British Columbia, the Court opined that it is not within the authority of the Legislature to enact a proposed amendment to the Environmental Management Act. The amendment was targeted legislation that in pith and substance relates to the regulation of an interprovincial (or “federal”) undertaking — the expanded interprovincial pipeline of Trans Mountain Pipeline ULC and Trans Mountain Pipeline L.P. which is intended to carry ‘heavy oil’ from Alberta to tidewater. The amendment thus lies beyond provincial jurisdiction.”By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Oil Rig Count Falls Amid Oil Price CorrectionHow Trump And Xi Killed The Oil RallyRed Flag For Oil Markets: Asian Refining Margins Plunge To 16-Year Low

The UK will need additional 28,000 public charging points for electric vehicles (EVs) by 2030—double the current number, to support an estimated fleet of seven million EVs by the end of the next decade, Deloitte said in new research.   Currently, the UK has 13,500 EV charging points—half of what the UK will need if it were to support seven million electric cars on the roads by 2030. Most of the currently operating charging points are likely to be replaced because of technological advances in the next decade, according to Deloitte.Capital expenditure for building the required EV charging network infrastructure will be around US$2 billion (1.6 billion British pounds) between 2020 and 2030, Deloitte has estimated.



Analysts have pointed to insufficient EV charging infrastructure as one of the key hindrances toward mass adoption of electric cars globally, alongside with battery range and the still higher prices of EVs than many gasoline and diesel vehicles.According to Deloitte, EV adoption in the UK could get to at least two million cars—a market share of 5 percent—by the middle of the next decade, if the battery ranges increase and costs come down to the levels of internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles.  “A shortage of public charging points will seriously hamper the adoption of electric vehicles. Yet only a continued uptake of EVs will provide the confidence to invest in, and develop, a charging infrastructure - a classic ‘chicken and egg’ scenario,” Mark Lillie, Power & Utilities Leader at Deloitte, said, commenting on the report.



The UK government’s Grand Challenge missions includes an ambition for at least 50 percent—and as many as 70 percent—of new cars sold in the UK to be ultralow emission by 2030. The UK government has also pledged “to massively expand electric and low emission vehicle infrastructure across the country.” By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Oil Rig Count Falls Amid Oil Price CorrectionHow Trump And Xi Killed The Oil RallyRed Flag For Oil Markets: Asian Refining Margins Plunge To 16-Year Low

France’s oil and gas major Total is looking to sell a third of its 17-percent interest in the giant Kashagan oil field in Kazakhstan, aiming to raise up to US$4 billion from the sale, Reuters reported on Friday, quoting four banking sources.Total is a member of the consortium that has signed the North Caspian Sea Production Sharing Agreement (NCSPSA), and holds a 16.81-percent stake in the North Caspian license, which encompasses the Kashagan oil field. Apart from Total, the other shareholders in the North Caspian Operating Company (NCOC) are Kazakhstan’s state oil and gas firm KazMunayGas, as well as Eni, Royal Dutch Shell, ExxonMobil, China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), and Inpex.Total’s entire stake in the company operating the Kashagan field is worth up to US$9 billion, according to Reuters’ sources.



In recent months, Total has been in talks with a Chinese state oil company about potentially selling part of its stake in Kashagan, but talks fell through because of disagreements over the price tag, two of the sources told Reuters.Total could make good use of the proceeds from a Kashagan stake sale, because earlier this month the French group signed a binding agreement with Occidental to buy Anadarko’s assets in Africa (Algeria, Ghana, Mozambique, South Africa) for US$8.8 billion, contingent upon Occidental completing its acquisition of Anadarko.Production at Kashagan, which started in 2016, is around 400,000 bpd, making the Kazakh field one of the largest offshore oil fields.



Kashagan has reserves of 13 billion barrels of crude and in-place resources of as much as 38 billion barrels. Its development has been challenging, mainly because of climatic and geological peculiarities, and because of cost overruns that saw the final budget more than double on the initial US$20 billion to US$50 billion. There have been plans to bring the field’s production rate to half a million barrels daily.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Oil Rig Count Falls Amid Oil Price CorrectionHow Trump And Xi Killed The Oil RallyOil Rebounds But Looks At Biggest Weekly Loss Of 2019

Tesla’s stock clawed back some losses on Thursday and was up more than 3 percent in pre-market trade on Friday, after a leaked email reportedly sent by Elon Musk to Tesla employees suggested that the electric vehicle (EV) maker has a good chance of making Q2 the highest deliveries and sales quarter in its history.On Thursday, an email believed to be sent to all Tesla employees by Musk on May 22 appeared on message boards, and breathed some life into Tesla’s shares that had been battered for several consecutive days after a growing number of investment banks and analysts outlined ‘bear-case’ scenarios for the EV maker. The bear camp is growing, with analysts expressing doubts about demand for Tesla’s Model 3 and increased risks of Tesla underperforming on the Chinese market after the collapse of the U.S.-China trade talks.Musk’s ‘leaked’ email came in just the right time for the stock.



The email reads:“As of yesterday we had over 50,000 net new orders for this quarter. Based on current trends, we have a good chance of exceeding the record 90,700 deliveries of Q4 last year and making this the highest deliveries/sales quarter in Tesla history!”However, the email believed to be sent by Musk also says that Tesla needs sustained production of 1,000 Model 3s every day in order to beat the previous record, while its production rate has averaged 900 Model 3s this week, “so we’re only about 10% away from 7,000/week.”Related: The Silence Before The Storm In Oil Markets



Over the past few days, a number of analysts have expressed doubts about Tesla’s ability to deliver on sales and financial performance and not burn all the cash it has. Wedbush Securities warned that Tesla faces a “Kilimanjaro-like uphill climb” and a “Herculean task” in achieving its targets.Morgan Stanley slashed its ‘worst-case’ Tesla share price target to just US$10 from US$97 in case the U.S.-China trade war hits the EV maker and dampens significantly demand for its cars on the Chinese market. Citigroup also has a shocking ‘full bear’ scenario for Tesla, seeing a 40-percent chance of Tesla’s stock plunging to $36, up from a 35-percent chance previously.Tesla’s shares hit on Monday the lowest since December 2016 at US$205, and closed at $195.49 on Thursday.

A new border crossing between Iraq and Syria is under construction in an area controlled by Iran-affiliated militias, Fox News reports, citing satellite images revealing construction works at the Albukamal Al-Qaim border crossing.The news outlet also cited unnamed sources as saying Iran was behind the new crossing—the old one was destroyed during one of the many military clashes in both Syria and Iraq—and it aimed to use it as a smuggling channel to Jordan and the Mediterranean coast.“Without Syrian or Iraqi supervision, Iran and its allies would have an unprecedented advantage in transferring whatever they wish,” Fox News reported, quoting unnamed experts.



The tightening grip of Washington on Tehran through economic sanctions was bound to cause Iran to look for ways to get its oil across borders, so in this sense, the news about a new border crossing is a hardly a surprise. Yet it has not been established who exactly is building the crossing despite the mention of Shiite militia controlling the region.These militias are active in more than one part of Iraq and were allies of the government in its war on the Islamic State. This has put Iraq in the difficult position of juggling Iranian and U.S. interests, which was what most likely prompted Baghdad’s initiative to try and mediate a de-escalations, although the chances of it succeeding are pretty slim.Iran also has ties in Syria: along with Russia it has fought against rebel groups including Al-Quaeda offshoots. Earlier this month, Tehran even resumed crude oil shipments to Syria: TankerTrackers.com reported a cargo of 1 million barrels of Iranian crude was spotted reaching Syria on May 5th. It was the first Iranian oil cargo sent there since the start of 2019.



Iran has also sealed a series of trade deals with Syria, Newsweek recently reported, including one for the management of the Latakia port on the Mediterranean coast.

Three PDVSA tankers that are late with payments to German operator Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement (BSM) are being detained, according to Reuters sources, as BSM gives up on waiting for payments while conducting business as usual with floundering state-run PDVSA.BSM operates almost half of PDVSA’s fleet of tankers, and has made a move to “arrest” three tankers due to the outstanding debt PDVSA has amassed.BSM and PDVSA have a troubled past, as PDVSA struggles to pay its bills while oil production and exports fall to new lows each month.



In March, BSM announced that it was removing its crews from 10 of these tankers due to a lack of payment, adding that it would return the tankers. PDV Marina—PDVSA’s shipping subsidiary—had declared an emergency following the announcement, saying it did not have the staff to accept the return of the 10 tankers. The amount of outstanding debt at that time was at least $15 million, according to Reuters. Three other tankers remained anchored in Portugal and Curacao while other financial disputes with PDVSA came to light, and BSM abandoned two vessels in Portugal after the staff had been onboard for 20 months.Mid-March, BSM said it was considering scrapping its agreement with PDVSA entirely as of the end of March or in April due to the sanctions levied against PDVSA. What’s more, BSM said, the political situation in Venezuela made it “an almost impossible task” to manage PDVSA’s assets.Following that announcement, another ship management firm, US-based McQuilling, announced in March as well that it would end its contracts with PDVSA due to the US Sanctions.



The three tankers BSM arrested are the Arita in Singapore, and the Parnaso and the Rio Arauca in Portugal, according to Reuters.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:How Trump And Xi Killed The Oil RallyThe Silence Before The Storm In Oil MarketsCanada’s Oil Hotspot Considers Going Nuclear

India has officially ended all oil imports from Iran, India’s Ambassador Harsh Vardhan Shringla said on Wednesday, after Prime Minister Narendra Modi has managed to emerge victorious from India’s elections, according to the Daily Mail.Shringla was reluctant to say whether India agreed with the United States’ stance on the sanctions, but did say that the sanctions have hurt India, who relies on Iran in particular for a sizeable chunk of its crude oil. It now has had to find new sources of crude oil after the United States refused to extend the waiver India was enjoying up until May 2.Reports came in suggesting that India had asked the United States for another sanction waiver so it could keep importing Iranian oil in the amount of 300,000 barrels per day, but the United States declined to extend any of the waivers.



While India is now in full compliance with the US sanctions on Iran, with the elections behind it, India may once again revisit the possibility of resuming oil purchases from Iran. India has already stated that it will review its decision to stop purchasing Iranian oil after its elections are in the review mirror. India joins a list of other Iranian oil purchasers that have officially stopped importing the sanctioned nation’s crude oil after the waivers expired, including Turkey.Analysts had previously doubted whether India would fully stop its purchases of cheap Iranian oil, even in light of the United States looking to hook India up with alternate supplies including Saudi Arabia and the UAE. While alternate supplies were not necessarily hard to come by, any deals with Saudi Arabia and the UAE would likely have less favorable terms than what it was getting from Iran.

Royal Dutch Shell said on Thursday that it had started oil production at its Appomattox floating production system months ahead of schedule, opening a new frontier in the deepwater U.S. Gulf of Mexico and starting first production ever from a Jurassic reservoir in the region.Appomattox—operated by Shell with 79 percent with a unit of China’s CNOOC holding 21 percent—is currently expected to produce 175,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d). Appomattox is the first commercial discovery brought into production in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico Norphlet formation. The Appomattox development and production will be closely followed by industry analysts because it could give indications about other potential reservoirs in the Norphlet formation.In May last year, Shell said that it had made a large deepwater exploration discovery in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, just 13 miles from Appomattox. The Dover discovery was Shell’s sixth in the Norphlet geologic play in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, and is considered an attractive potential tieback due to its proximity to Appomattox.



“Appomattox creates a core long-term hub for Shell in the Norphlet through which we can tie back several already discovered fields as well as future discoveries,” Andy Brown, Upstream Director at Shell, said in today’s statement announcing the start-up of oil production at Appomattox.The Appomattox development has cut costs by more than 40 percent since taking final investment decision in 2015, Shell said, without specifying how much it had spent.“The start of production at Appomattox is only just the beginning of further maximising the flow of resources in the prolific Norphlet surrounding Appomattox,” Shell said.



“If the Jurassic roars to life in 2019, it could give operators greater confidence in the play’s potential,” William Turner, senior research analyst at Wood Mackenzie, said at the end of last year in an analysis on the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, expecting this year to be historic for the region in terms of exploration and first-ever production from a Jurassic play.  “All eyes will be on the well performance of the potential heavy hitter,” WoodMac said, referring to Shell’s Appomattox.   By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Canada’s Oil Hotspot Considers Going NuclearOil Tanks On Worst Day In Six MonthsThe Silence Before The Storm In Oil Markets

Three environmental organizations in Texas plan to sue in federal court Valero Energy for violations of the Clean Air Act at the Port Arthur, Texas, refinery during what the groups said were “hundreds of so-called “emission events” that have occurred since May 2014.Environment Texas, Sierra Club, and the Port Arthur Community Action Network (PA-CAN) notified Valero and the Premcor Refining Group—which own and operate the Valero Port Arthur Refinery—of their plans to sue the oil companies.Under federal law, citizens and organizations can sue companies that have violated the Clean Air Act when state and federal authorities haven’t made them fall in line. 



“Based on available information, the Groups believe that Valero has repeatedly violated, is violating, and will continue to violate the federalClean Air Act (‘CAA’), the Texas State Implementation Plan, and Valero’s CAA permits by, among other things, emitting air pollutants at rates and in amounts not authorized by any permits or by state or federal regulation,” the three environmental groups said in the notice to sue.According to the environmentalists, there have been more than 600 violations of many hourly and annual limits on emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), hydrogen sulfide, nitrogen oxides, particulate matter, and other air pollutants over the past five years, as well as dozens of violations relating to improper operation of the refinery’s large industrial flares.Related: Natural Gas Prices In The Permian Flip Negative Again



The lawsuit can be filed within 60 days in U.S. District Court in Beaumont and it would be the fifth case that Environment Texas and Sierra Club have filed since 2008 over illegal emissions from oil refineries and petrochemical facilities along the Gulf Coast of Texas.In 2009, Environment Texas and Sierra Club settled a lawsuit with Shell over air pollution at its Deer Park, Texas, refinery and chemical plant. Last year, the two environmental groups also settled a suit with a Petrobras subsidiary for air pollution at the Pasadena refinery. Following a lawsuit filed by Environment Texas and Sierra Club that dragged on for years, ExxonMobil was ordered by a federal court in 2017 to pay US$19.95 million penalty for more than 16,000 violations of the Clean Air Act at its Baytown, Texas, refinery and chemical plant in what the environmental groups said they believed was “largest civil penalty ever imposed in an environmental “citizen suit.”By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.com  More Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Red Flag For Oil Markets: Asian Refining Margins Plunge To 16-Year LowOil Tanks On Worst Day In Six MonthsOil Prices Could Rise As Persian Gulf Becomes ‘Danger Zone’ For Tankers

In recent weeks, Iran has been storing more oil onshore and at tankers at sea as it looks to continue producing oil, but its crude exports are severely restricted by the U.S. sanctions, Reuters reported on Thursday, citing industry sources and ship-tracking data.Last month, the United States put an end to the six-month sanction waivers to all buyers of Iranian oil. A growing number of importers, refiners, insurers, and ship owners prefer to steer clear of dealings with Iranian oil instead of risking secondary sanctions or being cut off the U.S. banking and financial system.  Iran’s oil exports so far in May have probably averaged just 500,000 bpd or lower, according to tanker data and industry sources, cited by Reuters last week.



This compares to 1 million bpd and even more that Iran exported earlier this year, before the end of all U.S. sanction waivers.In early May, no tanker was seen leaving Iran for a foreign port, but Iran is believed to have increased the use of the ‘switch-off-the-transponder’ tactic, which makes tracking its exports via the AIS systems increasingly difficult and opaque.Iran, however, wants to keep pumping crude from its fields because if it stopped extracting oil, resuming production from those fields—many of them ageing—would require a hefty investment.



So the Islamic Republic is storing increasing volumes of its oil on land and at sea.Iran’s oil storage on land is estimated at 46.1 million barrels out of a total capacity of 73 million barrels, according to data from Kayrros, which tracks oil flows. This estimated volume of oil stored onshore is at its highest level since the middle of January. At sea, Iran is believed to currently store some 20 million barrels of oil on 16 Iranian tankers, up from 12 tankers with at least 13 million barrels in March, according to data from shipping intelligence platform MarineTraffic, cited by Reuters.  By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Kuwait, Qatar Look For Alternatives For Strait Of HormuzAlberta Introduces Carbon Tax Repeal BillU.S. Energy Storage Capacity Set To Double This Year

The world’s newest offshore hotspot, Guyana, is in the early stages of a probe into how oil exploration rights were awarded for oil blocks that are currently controlled by ExxonMobil and Tullow Oil, Clive Thomas, director of Guyana’s State Assets Recovery Agency, told Bloomberg in an interview published this week.Neither Exxon nor Tullow Oil are targets of the investigation. The two companies are not accused of any misconduct either. They are operators of the oil blocks which will be included in the scope of the investigation as the current administration in Guyana is looking to assess the procedures under which the oil blocks had been awarded.  The Stabroek, Kaieteur, Canje, and Orinduik blocks will be part of the investigation. Exxon is operator of Stabroek, Kaieteur, Canje, while Tullow Oil operates the Orinduik block.



“We’re building up a case. This is an area of investigation into how the blocks were allocated and the decisions that were made,” Thomas told Bloomberg.The little known South American country bordering Venezuela has become one of the world’s top hotspots for oil offshore operators in just a few years. Some critics of the way Guyana handled the oil block leases, such as the president’s former energy adviser Jan Mangal, argue that Guyana sold off its oil riches too cheaply. A curious fact was also the timing of a lease for the Kaieteur block to Exxon in the final days of the previous administration in 2015—the awarding of the block took place just nine days before Exxon announced its first (of now more than a dozen) discoveries offshore Guyana.Related: Kuwait, Qatar Look For Alternatives For Strait Of HormuzExxon was the world’s top oil and gas explorer in 2018, thanks to its significant investment in Guyana, according to Rystad Energy’s annual exploration review.



Guyana is one of Exxon’s key growth areas for the coming years, alongside the Permian.Earlier this month, Exxon gave the green light to the development of Liza Phase 2 offshore Guyana after it received government and regulatory approvals. Phase 2 is expected to begin producing up to 220,000 bpd in mid-2022, while Phase 1 is on schedule for first oil by first quarter of 2020, with up to 120,000 bpd of production.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Alberta Introduces Carbon Tax Repeal BillThe Silence Before The Storm In Oil MarketsThe Myth Of Cheap Shale Oil

Thailand’s Energy Ministry has asked regulators to keep a close eye on developments in the Middle East lest these cause an oil and gas shortage in the import-dependent country, local media report.According to the Bangkok Post, the ministry had also ordered six oil refineries to start reporting their supply rates and sales volumes as well as throughput on a daily basis. Until now, refineries had to report these on a monthly basis.Thailand’s strategic petroleum reserve is required to hold enough of the commodity for 30 to 45 days, which is within the average standard globally, and the ministry has not yet proposed to change this in anticipation of a possible supply shortage. Yet it is preparing for higher prices: the ministry said the country’s State Oil Fund has a sufficient amount of money in it to respond to price hikes.



rude oil is the top import commodity in Thailand, with refined oil products its top export commodity. The country produces oil locally as well, but nowhere near enough to satisfy demand. The average daily production has been falling as well: from over 150,000 bpd in 2017 to about 120,000 bpd since the start of 2019.The saber-rattling in the Middle East has got more than just Thailand worried about oil prices. An exchange of thinly veiled threats between President Trump and the Iranian government was what sparked the latest bout of worry on the oil market as some expect an open military conflict.Related: Natural Gas Prices In The Permian Flip Negative Again



The worry spiked when the U.S. ordered the evacuation of all non-emergency government employees from Iraq, suggesting the evacuation could be part of preparation for open confrontation with Iraq’s neighbor, Iran. Exxon also evacuated staff from the West Qurna 1 field in Iraq citing security concerns, which prompted a reaction of dissatisfaction from Baghdad.Despite the intensifying concern about a possible confrontation in the Middle East, prices have not trended as high as they might have a few years ago before U.S. production really took off. Although Brent is still around US$70 a barrel, with WTI above US$60 a barrel, the benchmarks have yet to rise to US$80 and over as some analysts have predicted.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Red Flag For Oil Markets: Asian Refining Margins Plunge To 16-Year LowU.S. Energy Storage Capacity Set To Double This YearThe Silence Before The Storm In Oil Markets

The United States has resumed—at least for the time being—oil imports from Venezuela, according to new data published by the Energy Information Administration (EIA).The United States saw a decrease in oil imports from Venezuela starting in week ending February 1 2019, when shipments fell to 345,000 barrels per day, from between 500,000 and 700,000 bpd earlier in the year. In earlier 2017 prior to any of the sanctions, Venezuela shipped over 1 million barrels per day to the US.The United States has long relied on Venezuelan oil imports to feed its perfectly suited oil refineries with heavy oil.



In March, these shipments trailed off complete for a few weeks, then resumed sporadically in April. The first few weeks of May saw zero oil imports from Venezuela to the United States, as the US continues to sanction Venezuela to effect change by way of ousting Nicolas Maduro.But for week ending May 17, oil shipments again resumed, in small quantity, to the tune of 49,000 barrels per day. The rogue shipment of oil to the United States means that the United States still hasn’t gone a whole month without taking any Venezuelan crude—ever.US refiners are still able to complete the transactions with Venezuela’s PDVSA that they had contracted prior to the United States implementing sanctions in January, although they are obligated to place the funds into a separate account that PDVSA cannot access.



Prior to the sanctions going into effect, Chevron’s Pascagoula refinery, Citgo’s Lake Charles and Corpus Christi refineries, and Valero’s Port Arthur and St. Charles refineries chewed up more than 90% of all the Venezuelan crude oil that came into the United States.The uncertainty around the rules for paying for the cargoes has caused quite the confusion, with some cargoes earlier stranded off the coast of Venezuela waiting for payments to clear. Citgo and Valero have proposed returning crude oil to Venezuela that had already been loaded prior to sanctions going into effect, and Chevron had previously tried to find a way to pay PDVSA for millions of outstanding barrels, according to Reuters.It is unclear to whom the 49,000 barrels was delivered.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:The Silence Before The Storm In Oil MarketsThe Myth Of Cheap Shale OilMoscow May Use ‘Nuclear Option’ In European Gas Race

Staying true to their promise from the campaign trail, Alberta’s Conservatives have introduced a bill to repeal a carbon tax introduced by their predecessors at the helm of the province, the New Democratic Party.Reuters reports that the repealment of the carbon tax was planned to be the first piece of legislation to be tabled by the new Conservative government of Jason Kenney, but adds that it would automatically enact a federal law on carbon taxes that targets provinces that do not have their own legislation to this effect.“The carbon tax has been all economic pain and no environmental gain. If Justin Trudeau’s government then seeks to impose a federal carbon tax in Alberta, we will see him in court,” Alberta’s Premier told media. This will add Alberta to three other provinces that have taken the federal government to court over the carbon tax: Ontario, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan. The last of these provinces lost its case in a win for the federal government.



According to the Alberta government, repealing the tax will bring more than a billion dollars into the provincial coffers and create as many as 6,000 new jobs—a sensitive issue in the energy industry-dependent province that has yet to fully recover from the 2014 oil price crisis.The carbon tax repealment effort is just part of Jason Kenney’s agenda. The new Premier came to power pledging to help the industry recover and so far he has been following his priorities in this respect.Related: Hydrogen Fuel Tech Just Got A Major BoostAs soon as it became clear who won the elections in Alberta, Kenney threatened British Columbia to turn the gasoline tap off “within an hour” of taking office if it continues to try and stop the Trans Mountain expansion. While he didn’t do that, he did immediately table the pipeline issue at talks with the Premiers of both British Columbia and Quebec once he took office earlier this year.



“You don’t start a relationship by shouting at each other. You start it by talking and trying to find common ground,” the Alberta Premier-designate told media. “We will begin with the path of diplomacy and … we hope that we don’t need to use more forceful measures to assert Alberta’s vital economic interests,” the Alberta Premier told media at the time.In addition to pipeline pressure and the removal of the carbon tax, Kenney has said he planned to hold a referendum in Alberta regarding the so-called equalization payments that the federal government distributes to smooth out financial inequalities among provinces. Plans are to tie these payments to the construction of new pipelines.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Natural Gas Prices In The Permian Flip Negative AgainThe Silence Before The Storm In Oil MarketsMoscow May Use ‘Nuclear Option’ In European Gas Race

As tensions in the Middle East continue to escalate with Iran threatening to choke off shipments through oil’s most critical chokepoint, the Strait of Hormuz, two countries are looking for a workaround to avoid the Strait in the event of a closure, according to an Iraqi lawmaker said on Wednesday, cited by Kurdistan24.Regardless of how unlikely it may be that Iran make good on its threat to close the Strait of Hormuz should the United States effectively bring Iran’s oil exports to zero, the countries that rely on the shipments through the Strait are working in the background, pre-emptively finding a way around should the worst-case scenario come to fruition.Qatar and Kuwait have both approached Iraq, proposing to use Iraq “as an alternative path for oil transport” should the need arise, through the Iraqi pipeline.



On Tuesday, Iraqi Prime Minster Adil Abdul-Mahdi suggested that it would be possible to move Iraqi oil through the Kurdistan region to the Port of Ceyhan in Turkey.Source: USAID



Threatening to close off the Strait of Hormuz is a particularly mouthwatering prospect that sees about 18.5 million barrels per day of oil through its narrow passage, according to the EIA, about 80% of which heads to Asian markets.""According to international law, the Strait of Hormuz is a marine passageway and if we are barred from using it, we will shut it down. In case of any threat, we will have not even an iota of doubt to protect and defend the Iranian waters.

Russia is sending clean within-standards crude oil via the Druzhba pipeline toward Hungary and Slovakia, with first clean oil expected to arrive at the metering stations in those countries within a week, Russia’s energy ministry said on Wednesday, a month after supplies were halted due to contaminated crude.Russia also continues negotiations with Poland in view of restarting the crude oil flow via the pipeline to the Adamova Zastava station, Russian media quoted the country’s energy ministry as saying in a statement.The now month-long suspension of Russian oil supply via pipeline to several European countries comes as global supply outages mount with Venezuela and Iran, and with increasing supply disruption risks in Libya or in the Middle East.



Last month, Russia halted supplies via the Druzhba oil pipeline to several European countries due to a contamination issue, which the Russians say was deliberate.  The oil was contaminated with organic chlorine, a substance used in oil production to boost output but dangerous in high amounts for refining equipment. The amounts of the chemical were found to be at levels much higher than the maximum allowable amount.The Russian oil supply contamination has disrupted the refinery operations of some companies. Total, for example, halted last week some of the units at its 230,000-bpd Leuna refinery in Germany to conduct technical checks. On Thursday, Total declared force majeure on shipments of refined oil products from the Leuna refinery.



Total and Eni are said to have suspended payments to the Russian companies that sold them contaminated crude, in a new controversy in what trading sources described to Reuters as the “biggest Russian oil supply disruption ever.”  Russian pipeline operator Transneft will compensate its customers for the losses they have sustained due to the contaminated oil, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Kozak said last week, noting that refiners must first prove their damage and loss in order to claim compensation.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Why China Hasn’t Slapped Tariffs On U.S. Oil ImportsWhat The Market Is Overlooking In The Occidental DealU.S. Shale Oil Production Set To Grow 16% This Year

Iraq will raise the oil production from its giant West Qurna 1 field by as much as 50,000 bpd in the next few days, a senior industry official told Reuters on Wednesday, days after the oil field developer ExxonMobil evacuated all its foreign staff from the field amid security concerns.Currently, the West Qurna 1 oil field pumps around 440,000 bpd, while Iraq’s intention is to increase that production to 490,000 bpd within days, Basra Oil Company chief Ihsan Abdul Jabbar told Reuters.Last week, ExxonMobil began evacuating its engineers working at West Qurna 1 as security concerns mounted with the heightened tension in the Middle East amid the U.S.-Iran and Saudi-Iran standoffs. Other international oil majors, including BP and Chevron, are said to be monitoring the situation in Iraq very closely.



The exodus from Iraq comes after the United States ordered last week the evacuation of all non-essential government employees from Iraq citing security concerns, adding that the US embassy in Iraq would suspend visa services and would have a “limited ability to provide emergency services to US citizens in Iraq.”The security issues came to light mid-week last week after the United States ordered all non-essential personnel evacuated from the country citing possible threats from Iran, presumably via the Iraqi Shi’ite militia.Related: New Middle East Proxy War Could Jolt Oil PricesIraq was not happy with Exxon’s hasty evacuation of all foreign personnel from West Qurna 1, with its oil minister Thamer Ghadhban saying the exit was “unacceptable and unjustified.” According to the Iraqi minister, Exxon’s staff evacuation has nothing to do with security threats, instead arguing that it was politically motivated.



Earlier this month, Iraq was close to signing a mega US$53-billion deal with Exxon and PetroChina to develop oil fields in the south. The deal was “very close” but has been slowed by Exxon’s departure from Iraq, Ghadhban said this weekend.  Any security-risk-related disruption of oil production in Iraq—OPEC’s second-largest producer after Saudi Arabia—would not go unnoticed on the oil market, which has already started to consider a perceived higher risk of supply outages in the Middle East.

A subsidiary of Occidental and Canadian clean energy company Carbon Engineering are teaming up to build the world’s biggest Direct Air Capture (DAC) and sequestration facility in the Permian that will suck carbon dioxide from the air to be later used in enhanced oil recovery.Occidental’s subsidiary Oxy Low Carbon Ventures (OLCV) and Carbon Engineering are proceeding with the engineering and design of this facility aimed at capturing 500 kilotons of carbon dioxide (CO2) directly from the atmosphere each year, which would be used in Occidental’s enhanced oil recovery (EOR) operations and subsequently stored underground permanently, the companies said in a joint statement.In case the two companies approve the plant, construction is expected to start in 2021, and the plant is set to be operational some two years later.



“Using atmospheric CO2 for oil recovery greatly reduces the net addition of CO2 to the atmosphere from oil production and fuel use, and opens a pathway to producing fully carbon-neutral or even net-negative fuels,” OLCV President Richard Jackson said.“These carbon removal technologies need to be deployed widely and at large enough scales to be climate-relevant,” Steve Oldham, CEO at Carbon Engineering, said.Carbon Engineering—a privately owned company funded by private investors, including Bill Gates and Murray Edwards—said last year that it had developed an affordable way to capture CO2 from the atmosphere and convert it into clean fuels. Not only are the scientists sucking CO2 out of the air, but they are also commercializing a process which uses water electrolysis and fuels synthesis to produce clean liquid hydrocarbon fuels that are drop-in compatible with existing transportation infrastructure.



Occidental, for its part, is already using CO2 to enable low-cost EOR and will have a lot more Permian operations after it outbid Chevron and signed earlier this month an agreement to buy Anadarko in one of the largest deals in the oil industry in the past few years.

Rising U.S. production weighed on oil prices in the first quarter compared to the same period last year, and those lower prices, combined with weak refining margins, impacted the revenues and net profits of many of the world’s largest listed companies in the oil industry.According to data compiled by Anadolu Agency from the Q1 2019 reports of the 12 top listed companies in the oil industry—ExxonMobil, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Halliburton, Schlumberger, Baker Hughes, BP, Royal Dutch Shell, Total, Eni, Equinor, and Rosneft—the combined net income and revenues at those companies were lower in the first quarter this year compared to Q1 2018.According to Anadolu Agency’s calculations, the combined revenue of these 12 companies declined by 4.63 percent annually to some US$393.5 billion in Q1 2019. The combined net profits dropped by 4.45 percent—to US$23.6 billion from US$24.7 billion for Q1 2018.



Shell was the top performing company with the highest net profit and revenue in absolute terms, according to Anadolu Agency’s estimates.Shell was one of the last oil supermajors to report Q1 earnings and it was the one that stood out among the crowd with better-than-expected results, as its trading and natural gas businesses offset weak oil prices and depressed refining margins that plagued the other majors in the Q1 earnings season.Volatile crude prices and weak refining margins led to lower earnings at all five oil supermajors in the first quarter of 2019, suggesting that Big Oil shouldn’t stay complacent several quarters after the industry emerged from one of the worst downturns in a generation.



Big Oil’s five majors—ExxonMobil, Chevron, BP, Total, and Shell—reported a mixed bag of results for Q1. While net earnings at all companies were lower than last year’s first quarter on the back of lower average Brent Crude prices compared to Q1 2018 and weak refining margins that battered downstream earnings, some supermajors, such as Shell, met and even exceeded analyst expectations thanks to strong trading profits and to their natural gas businesses.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Oman’s Newest Approach To Boost Oil ProductionNew Middle East Proxy War Could Jolt Oil PricesCould This Emerging Oil State Become The Richest Nation In The World?

Saudi Aramco struck a deal with U.S. Sempra Energy to buy 5 million tons of liquefied natural gas annually from Sempra’s Port Arthur LNG plant, Reuters reports, citing the two companies, which confirmed an earlier report in the Wall Street Journal.The Port Arthur facility has yet to be built and Aramco has also negotiated a 25-percent stake purchase in its first phase of development. The project includes the construction of two liquefaction trains along with up to three storage tanks and the relevant infrastructure.Sempra has five LNG projects under development right now, in Louisiana, Texas, and Mexico, that together will have the capacity to produce 45 million tons of LNG, The company’s CEO told Reuters in March. That’s more than what Cheniere Energy, the current leader in this space, plans to have in terms of capacity at its two LNG plants in Sabine Pass and Corpus Christi.



Yet now, according to the joint statement, the Port Arthur facility’s capacity alone could be expanded to 45 million tons annually. According to the statement, “Port Arthur LNG could be one of the largest LNG export projects in North America, with potential expansion capabilities up to eight liquefaction trains or approximately 45 Mtpa of capacity.”“Port Arthur LNG could be one of the largest LNG export projects in North America, with potential expansion capabilities of up to eight liquefaction trains or approximately 45 mtpa of capacity,” Aramco and Sempra said in a joint statement.Related: OPEC+ Top Priority: Don’t Crash Oil PricesNatural gas in general and LNG specifically are part of Aramco’s diversification plans for the future, with the Saudi state company planning to expand quickly into them and away from crude oil, reflecting changing global demand patterns.



U.S. LNG is an obvious choice for the company, especially after the European Union pledged to boost its imports of U.S. LNG twofold within five years. However, Aramco is also eyeing a stake in Russian LNG. There have been media reports for several months now that the Saudi company may join French Total and Chinese CNPC and CNOOC in Novatek’s Arctic LNG 2 project, which will have an annual capacity of 19.8 million tons.Total and the two Chinese companies have already agreed to buy 10 percent each in the project, which leaves another 10 percent for Aramco, since Novatek wants to retain a 60-percent interest in the project.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:The Fear Driven Oil Price Rally Won’t LastPermian Pipeline Protesters May Face Decade Behind BarsHydrogen Fuel Tech Just Got A Major Boost

The American Petroleum Institute (API) reported another surprise build in crude oil inventory of 2.4 million barrels for the week ending May 17, coming in over analyst expectations of a 2.53-million-barrel drawdown in inventories.Last week, the API reported a surprise build in crude oil inventories of 8.6 million barrels. A day later, the EIA estimated that US inventories had increased by 5.4 million barrels.Including this week’s data, the net build is now 31.92 million barrels for the 21-week reporting period so far this year, using API data.


Oil prices rose early on Tuesday before sinking in the early afternoon, with the market left wondering how to accurately weigh the geopolitical stressors such as sanctions on Iran and Venezuela, attacks on Saudi- and UAE-owned oil tankers off the Strait of Hormuz, and US/China trade talks.WTI was trading down on Tuesday before the data release at $63.03, down $0.18 (-0.28%) on the day at 12:38pm. WTI was still trading $1 up week on week. The Brent benchmark was also trading down on the day at $71.83, down $0.14 (-0.19%) at that time. The Brent benchmark was trading up just $.40 week on week.The API this week reported a small build in gasoline inventories for week ending May 17 in the amount of 350,000 barrels. Analysts estimated a draw in gasoline inventories of 1.516-million barrels for the week.Distillate inventories fell by 240,000 barrels for the week, while inventories at Cushing rose by 870,000 barrels.



US crude oil production as estimated by the Energy Information Administration showed that production for the week ending May 10—the latest information available—fell for the second week in a row to 12.1 million bpd from the all-time high of 12.3 million bpd two weeks prior.The U.S. Energy Information Administration report on crude oil inventories is due to be released on Wednesday at 10:30a.m. EST.By 4:40pm EST, WTI was trading down at $63.01 and Brent was trading up at $72.04.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:The Threat In Iraq Is Being OverblownOne Country That Could Win Big From The U.S., China Trade WarWhy Oil Is Still Underpriced

The United States is increasing its oil imports from Russia, according to a Bloomberg source, as US refineries clamor for more oil now that Venezuelan oil supplies have dried up.The amount of oil that flowed into the United States from Russia so far in May was exponentially greater, said Russ Dallen of Caracas Capital Markets. United States took a total of 5 million barrels of Russian crude so far this month, and more are on the way.



The United States imported less Russian crude in January and February, purchasing a total of 16.13 million barrels of crude and other oil products, according to the Energy Information Administration. This compares to 20.25 million during that period in 2018. But the US is expected to increase this as much as three times now that Venezuela is no longer a crude supplier to the United States.In January and February, Venezuela shipped 27.67 million barrels to the United States. This is lower than in January and February 2018, when oil shipments from Venezuela to the United States came in at 29.589 million for the two-month period—the latest official EIA data available—with an expectation that these have plummeted to zero in May.



The data suggests that Russia is all too happy to pick up the slack left by Venezuela and profit from it—much like Saudi Arabia and the UAE are happy to do as Iranian oil exports fall to new lows. For Russia, this could be viewed as a rather opportunistic hedge against the money it has lent to Venezuela, with slim hopes of Venezuela ever paying it back.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Hydrogen Fuel Tech Just Got A Major BoostOil Stabilizes Ahead Of Weekly Inventory DataU.S. Shale Oil Production Set To Grow 16% This Year

More than 99 percent of BP’s shareholders voted in favor of a climate change shareholder resolution on Tuesday, pushing the UK oil and gas supermajor to set out a business strategy consistent with the climate goals of the Paris Agreement.BP, along with other oil majors, has been facing increased investor pressure to start addressing climate change risks and set emission reduction targets if the world is ever to achieve the Paris Agreement targets.At BP’s annual general meeting in Aberdeen on Tuesday, 99.14 percent of shareholders voted for the binding climate change resolution filed by investors acting as part of the Climate Action 100+ investor initiative, and supported by the BP board.



“Investors will reserve judgement and expect BP’s response to be sufficiently robust. They will pay close attention to how it addresses emissions across its full value chain and expect to see clear evidence that any future material capex investment is consistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement,” said Stephanie Pfeifer, a member of the global Climate Action 100+ Steering Committee and CEO at the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change (IIGCC).Another, more stringent resolution calling for BP to include emissions of its customers in climate goals, was rejected by BP’s shareholders. Such customer-emission reporting is not supported by BP’s management either. Shell, for example, announced earlier this year its first-ever short-term goals to cut the carbon footprint of its operations and product sales. In December last year, in an industry first, Shell said that it plans to set short-term targets for reducing the net carbon footprint of the energy products it sells, and to link those targets with executive remuneration. Related: The Single Most Bullish Indicator For Oil



However, Shell’s core business is and will continue to be oil and gas for the foreseeable future, the supermajor’s chief executive Ben van Beurden said last fall. “We aim play our part in the transition and to deliver on a strategy that is consistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement,” BP’s chairmanHelge Lund said at today’s shareholders meeting in Aberdeen, while climate change activists shouted “this is a crime scene” outside the building where the meeting was held.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:U.S. Shale Oil Production Set To Grow 16% This YearOPEC+ Top Priority: Don’t Crash Oil PricesWar With Iran Could Send Oil To $250

Malaysian state-controlled oil and gas company Petronas said on Tuesday that it had achieved first liquefied natural gas (LNG) production from its floating LNG facility Satu off the northeastern coast of the island of Borneo.Gas from the Kebabangan field is being fed to the PETRONAS Floating LNG Satu (PFLNG Satu) facility via a flexible pipeline. The floating facility is now used at a new location after producing LNG from the Kanowit gas field offshore a neighboring Malaysian state, where Petronas started a world first production of LNG from a floating LNG facility in 2017.“We not only prove our concept of relocatable floating LNG facility, but we have also seamlessly achieved the first LNG drop in just 3 days after first gas in,” Petronas Vice President of LNG Asset, Zakaria Kasah, said in a statement.



Malaysia is one of the top LNG producers in the world and will be facing stiff competition in the coming years from a wave of new LNG projects, especially in the United States.Rystad Energy forecast earlier this year that global LNG production will increase by 11 percent in 2019 and reach 350 million tons per annum on the back of more liquefaction capacity.Related: OPEC+ Top Priority: Don’t Crash Oil Prices“This is mostly driven by the commissioning of US projects. The US is expected to see capacity more than double in 2019, thereby making it the country with the third-largest exporting capacity and pushing Malaysia into fourth place. Australia could also overtake Qatar as the world’s largest LNG exporter this year,” Rystad Energy’s head of gas market research Carlos Torres Diaz said in February this year.



According to Wood Mackenzie, more than 60 million tons in annual production capacity is due a final investment decision this year—a record number and a hefty increase over the 21 million tons in capacity sanctioned last year. This could tip the market into oversupply, but not this year: LNG projects take years to build, Wood Mac said in January this year.In a more recent estimate, Giles Farrer, WoodMac’s Research Director, Global Gas and LNG Supply, said at the end of April:“While there is a risk that current low LNG prices may cause some proposed projects to be cancelled, we think the risk to new LNG supply development is actually to the upside. In our high case we anticipate that an additional 70 mmtpa could be sanctioned in the next three years.” By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:War With Iran Could Send Oil To $250One Country That Could Win Big From The U.S., China Trade WarOil Rises But Some Drillers Are Filing For A Second Bankruptcy

Despite criticizing the U.S. decision not to extend any sanction waivers for Iranian oil customers, Turkey appears to be fully complying with the U.S. sanctions on Iran’s oil, Reuters reported on Tuesday, citing tanker tracking data.Turkey was one of the eight buyers of Iranian oil that were given an initial six-month waiver to continue importing crude from Iran at reduced volumes after the U.S. slapped back sanctions on Iran in November last year. Under its ‘maximum pressure’ campaign against Iran, the U.S. ended all waivers for all Iranian customers as of early May.On the day on which the U.S. announced that it was not extending any exemptions to any Iranian oil buyer, Turkey’s Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu tweeted:“The US decision to end sanctions waivers on Iran oil imports will not serve regional peace and stability, yet will harm Iranian people. Turkey rejects unilateral sanctions and impositions on how to conduct relations with neighbors.”



Earlier this month, Cavusoglu said that Turkey will not be able to “quickly” source oil from alternate sources after the end of the U.S. waivers.  “It does not seem possible for us to diversify the sources of the oil we import in a short time,” Cavusoglu said.Turkey’s refineries, according to the minister, are not equipped to process crude oil from just any other country, and would therefore require retooling—something that is not only time intensive but costly.Related: War With Iran Could Send Oil To $250However, so far in May—the first month in which the U.S. doesn’t allow any sanction waivers on Iran’s oil—no tanker loaded in Iran has arrived at a Turkish port, according to Refinitiv tanker tracking data cited by Reuters.



Turkey’s biggest refiner Tupras had tried to negotiate a waiver before the end of the previous exemptions, but it wasn’t granted such and made it clear it wouldn’t import oil from Iran, a source familiar with the negotiations told Reuters.Before the U.S. withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal in May of 2018, Turkey was importing nearly half—or 47 percent—of its crude from Iran, according to Reuters data.Subsequently, Turkey had reduced its imports from Iran and has started to buy more oil from Russia, Kazakhstan, and Iraq, to replace Iranian barrels, according to analysts.  By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Oil Rises But Some Drillers Are Filing For A Second BankruptcyOne Country That Could Win Big From The U.S., China Trade WarOPEC+ Top Priority: Don’t Crash Oil Prices

Mid-cap oil and gas companies are having trouble securing fresh investments because fund managers are reorienting their priorities towards alternative energies, says the chief financial officer of one such company, UK-based Hurricane Energy, as quoted by Energy Voice.Private equity firms are still willing to invest in oil and gas exploration, but this is not the case with investors in public companies. As a result, Alistair Stobie told Energy Voice, the industry needs to do more to restore faith among investors that fossil fuels will have a role to play in the future energy mix even if it is a smaller one.



The biggest part of the problem facing medium-sized energy independents seems to be that most specialist investors—those focusing specifically on the energy industry—were “wiped out” during the latest industry downturn and now sector players are finding themselves having to deal with what Stobie called “generalist” investors: funds and institutions who spread their investments across many different industries and whose priorities are different.An important group among these is investment funds who are now placing a lot more emphasis on environmental, social, and governance factors than pure growth in returns. For now, the problem is not acute, the executive said, but in might become so in the future.



“There are fewer oil and gas experts available and the pressure not to invest is greater,” Stobie told Energy Voice. The rise of the generalist investors also means there is less specialist knowledge among investors about new discoveries and their future prospects, he added.Hurricane Energy is one of the private equity-backed energy independents that flooded the UK North Sea when the supermajors began to pull out to focus on quicker-return projects in U.S. shale and elsewhere. The company is operator of the Lancaster field, one of the largest recent discoveries in the area estimated to hold some 500 million barrels of crude oil.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:OPEC+ Top Priority: Don’t Crash Oil PricesOil Rises But Some Drillers Are Filing For A Second BankruptcyOne Country That Could Win Big From The U.S., China Trade War

After Tesla’s stock slumped to its lowest level since December 2016 on the back of bearish analyst coverage on Monday, Morgan Stanley chimed in on Tuesday, slashing its ‘worst-case’ Tesla share price target to just US$10 from US$97 in case the U.S.-China trade war hits the EV maker and dampens significantly demand for its cars on the Chinese market.According to Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas, the key drivers for the ‘bear case’ downgrade are a worst-case outcome of the trade war and rising debts at Tesla.According to Jonas, Tesla’s sales in China could generate as much as US$9 billion between 2020 and 2024, but if China were to hit Tesla with tariffs and restrictions amid an all-out trade war with the U.S., Tesla’s potential Chinese sales could fall to half that figure, which could erase US$16.4 billion of Tesla’ market capitalization.“Our revised case assumes Tesla misses our current Chinese volume forecast by roughly half, to account for the highly volatile trade situation in the region, particularly around areas of technology, which we believe run a high and increasing risk of government/regulatory attention,” Jonas said in a note, as carried by The Street.



After disappointing deliveries and a big loss in the first quarter of this year, Elon Musk suggested that “There is some merit to raising capital.”A week later, Tesla raised more than US$2.3 billion through offering common stock and convertible bonds in a move that analysts described as “net positive” and probably long overdue.Yet, some analysts continue to believe that Tesla needs more capital injections on top of the funds it raised earlier this month in order to stay afloat.Related: Why China Hasn’t Slapped Tariffs On U.S. Oil ImportsAccording to Morgan Stanley’s note, as carried by Reuters:



“We believe as Tesla’s share price declines, the likelihood of the company potentially seeking alternatives from strategic/industrial/financial partners rises.”While Morgan Stanley’s Jonas slashed the ‘bear-case’ price target for Tesla, he left unchanged the base-case target on Tesla’s stock at US$230, while the bull-case price target is US$391.Tesla’s (NASDAQ: TSLA) shares were down more than 2 percent in pre-market trade on Tuesday, after they hit on Monday the lowest since December 2016 at US$205, after Wedbush Securities cut their share price target to US$230 from US$275.  By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Why Oil Is Still UnderpricedThe Single Most Bullish Indicator For OilOn The Cusp Of War: Why Iran Won’t Fold

China has allocated a new batch of oil product export quotas that has brought the total since the start of the year to 50 million tons, S&P Global Platts reports citing documents.At 4.71 million tons, this batch of export quotas are allocated to the state oil companies—Sinopec, CNOOC, Sinochem, and CNPC – under the processing trade route and are added to an earlier batch that amounted to 3.14 million tons and the first batch of general trade route quotas totaled 18.36 million tons.Earlier in the month, Beijing allocated the second batch of export quotas for refiners under the general trade route, which was significantly higher than the one under the processing trade route. It stood at 23.79 million tons of oil products.



While quotas under the general trade route focused most heavily on gasoline—at 9.09 million tons—and gasoil, the quota for which was 9.175 million tons, the latest batch of export quotas under the processing trade route the largest share fell on jet fuel, at 4.62 million tons, followed by moderate amounts of gasoil and gasoline, at 80,000 tons and 10,000 tons, respectively.Last week, Chinese government data showed refiners were processing crude oil at the rate of 12.68 million bpd as of the end of April, up 5 percent from a year ago and a record high. According to a January report by CNPC, 12.68 million bpd was to be the average processing rate in China this year.Under the general trade route, refiners can export oil products regardless of whether they were made using domestic or imported crude. Under the processing trade route, refiners don’t have to pay taxes on the exported oil products.



There will be a third batch of oil product export quotas this year but no updates have been released on whether it will be allocated.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:OPEC+ Top Priority: Don’t Crash Oil PricesWhy China Hasn’t Slapped Tariffs On U.S. Oil ImportsOne Country That Could Win Big From The U.S., China Trade War

China will invest some 160 billion yuan (US$23.5 billion) in an offshore wind power project that will have an installed capacity of more than 10GW Chinese state news agency Xinhua reported, citing the local government of Jiangsu where the project will be located.Wind power, according to Xinhua, is the third-largest source of energy in the country after coal and hydropower. The country is already the world leader in wind power with 187 GW in capacity in early 2018. The plan is to increase this to 210 GW by the end of 2020.Renewable energy as a whole and wind energy specifically is a top priority for China as it fights one of the worst air pollution levels in the world while subject to an uncomfortably high degree of reliance on energy imports, namely oil and gas. At the same time, it is one of the biggest—if not the single biggest—driver of global energy demand as its middle class grows fast and with it, energy demand.



So it makes sense that a country in this position would try to make the best of the renewable energy opportunities it has. In 2017, China’s share in global energy demand was estimated to reach 28 percent in 2035, from 23 percent in 2017. In that same year, Beijing announced it will invest US$360 billion in renewable energy by 2020 and cancel plans for the construction of 85 new coal-powered plants.Related: On The Cusp Of War: Why Iran Won’t FoldThe renewables bet, however, is not without challenges. One of these are the generous subsidies in solar that prompted a boom in this energy industry segment. The boom was so intense, Beijing had to roll back some of the subsidies as they threatened to cost it a lot more than originally expected. So earlier this year the authorities said they would only approve new solar projects if their cost is on par with coal capacity.In wind and solar both, China’s renewables industry faces another problem: so-called curtailment or the waste of electricity produced by wind and solar farms because the grid can’t take it all. To solve that, China is building supergrids.



Last year, China generated 1.87 trillion kWh of electricity from renewable sources and boasts rising utilization rates despite the persistent challenges.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Why Oil Is Still UnderpricedWhat The Market Is Overlooking In The Occidental DealMiddle East Tensions Put Oil Markets On Edge

Yet Another US Presidential hopeful rolled out yet another climate change solution on Monday, this time by Democrat Michael Bennet, and this one topping the charts as far as its cost.The plan, titled “America’s Climate Change Plan’’, was outlined on Monday on Bennet’s website, and will cost $10 trillion—by far the most expensive climate solution proposed this election campaign.Bennet’s plan aggressively calls for “100 percent clean, net-zero emissions as soon as possible, and no later than 2050.”



The plan includes a specific “Climate X Option” whereby power providers would be required to offer zero-emission options to every household and business in America. More ambiguously, the plan calls on American agriculture to “lead the global fight against climate change”.Other aspects of the plan would see the create of a Climate Bank to “catalyze $10 trillion in private sector investment in innovation and infrastructure that creates new markets for American businesses.”Under the ambitious plan, America would cut energy waste in half by 2040 through investments in both zero-emission and flex-fuel vehicles and infrastructure.



The timing comes just a week after another Presidential hopeful, Jay Inslee, unveiled his plan for tacking climate change for a price tag of $9 trillion, and a couple of months after Rep. Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Markey presented ‘’The New Green Deal’’.The timing of the release comes in the wake of what the media are viewing as an Australian election upset over the weekend, during which the liberal climate change agenda was decidedly rejected by the Australian people, despite polling to the contrary. The election results down under might have given American Democrats pause in pursuing a climate agenda whole hog, but today’s rollout shows that might not be the case.The Australian polls showed that climate change was the most important issue for the Australian people.

“Unacceptable and unjustified” are the words Iraqi Oil Minister Thamer Ghadhban used to describe ExxonMobil’s hasty exit from the troubled country, according to Reuters, but a late-night rocket strike in Iraq suggests Exxon’s move was timely.Exxon began evacuating its foreign engineering personnel last week from the West Qurna 1 field in Iraq due to security concerns, Al Arabiya reported at the time. While Exxon neither confirmed nor denied the report last week, Iraqi officials are confirming that Exxon has removed 60 people—or all of its foreign employees.The security issues came to light mid-week last week after the United States ordered all non-essential personnel from the country citing possible threats from Iran, presumably via the Iraqi Shi’ite militia.



Ghadhban said that Exxon’s personnel shuffling had a different motive.""The withdrawal of multiple employees - despite their small number - temporarily has nothing to do with the security situation or threats in the oilfields in of southern Iraq, but it's for political reasons,"" Ghadhban said, adding that he had sent a letter to Iraq asking for the company to return to work in the oilfield.Exxon’s departure seems rather prudent, however, given the late-night rocket strike near the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad that the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday. Iran was quick to denounce the attacks.



Iraq says that the production at the West Qurna 1 field is not affected by Exxon’s exit, with production still holding at 440,000 barrels per day. However, Exxon’s abrupt departure from the country could put a strain on a $53 billion energy deal that is currently in the works between Exxon, PetroChina, and Iraq—the latter of which stands to rake in $400 billion over the 30-year period that the deal spans, adding more than 350,000 bpd of oil to Iraq’s capabilities.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Why Oil Is Still UnderpricedThe Driving Force Behind Nigeria’s Energy RenaissanceWhat The Market Is Overlooking In The Occidental Deal

Lone Star Ports LLC, backed by Carlyle Group, will be seeking a faster-track approval from the U.S. Administration for its project to build the first U.S. onshore export terminal capable of servicing supertankers on an island near Corpus Christi, officials tell Reuters.Lone Star Ports plans to build the terminal on the Harbor Island as U.S. oil production continues to grow, while current oil export infrastructure is insufficient to handle growing crude exports. The planned terminal will be able to service full-laden Very Large Crude Carriers (VLCC)—the so-called supertankers with the ability to carry up to 2 million barrels of crude oil each.Lone Star Ports plans to file documents this week with the Federal Permitting Improvement Steering Council (FPISC), asking to join a list of infrastructure projects that could be fast-tracked through local, state, and federal reviews.



The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) has recommended an environmental impact assessment review of the project, which could take two years or more. Carlyle has been hoping to be able to proceed with the project after a shorter review, or environmental assessment, which could take less than a year.“To have clarity on timing is extremely helpful for us,” Jeremiah “Jerry” Ashcroft, CEO at Lone Star Ports, told Reuters, adding that if the project were added to priority infrastructure projects, the dredging of the ship channel is more likely to move forward.Related: On The Cusp Of War: Why Iran Won’t FoldLone Star Ports and Carlyle are yet to make a final investment decision on the export terminal project.



In March this year, the Port of Corpus Christi Commission approved a 50-year lease agreement with Lone Star Ports for around 200 acres on Harbor Island to develop the oil export terminal. The previous month, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) had awarded the first dredging contract for the Corpus Christi Ship Channel Improvement Project to deepen the channel to a depth of 56’ from the Channel entrance to Harbor Island, and a planned depth of 54’ throughout the rest of the harbor.The ability to handle supertankers is expected to be a key asset for any future export terminal, considering that U.S. crude oil exports have been steadily growing in recent months.

Crude and lease condensate production in the North Sea is set for lower levels in the summer months, further tightening the global oil market which is already grappling with production declines in Iran and Venezuela, OPEC’s cuts, and a contamination issue that shut some Russian pipeline supplies to Europe, according to Rystad Energy.Current unplanned outages at Oseberg and Flotta in the North Sea restrict a total of 160,000 bpd of North Sea production, the energy research firm said on Friday.Rystad has estimated that outages in the North Sea in May will be 185,000 bpd. Yet, the biggest disruption is expected next month, when North Sea oil production is seen down to its lowest level since August 2014 because of scheduled maintenance at Ekofisk.



According to Rystad Energy’s field production and maintenance forecast, North Sea oil production will slump in June to 2.28 million bpd, when 462,000 bpd will be lost due to outages. Turnaround activity at the oil fields feeding Ekofisk will be the primary driver for the lower North Sea production, accounting for 230,000 bpd of the total outage in June 2019.“The oil market is in for a tight start to the summer indeed,” Rystad Energy said.Apart from scheduled maintenance this summer, North Sea production has been recently disrupted by unplanned outages. One was at Oseberg—whose crude oil is one of the components of the Brent Crude benchmark—where Equinor stopped production earlier this month as a precaution due to issues with fire water pumps, and then extended the shutdown period more than initially expected.



According to an Equinor email to S&P Global Platts, the Oseberg oil field resumed production on Monday.In the UK North Sea, repairs on pipelines shut down production at three platforms as of last Friday: Claymore, the Golden Eagle, and Tartan.“We are carrying out repairs to a valve on the main export pipeline from Claymore to the Flotta terminal,” a spokeswoman for the operator Repsol Sinopec told Energy Voice.

Venezuelans are having their fuel rationed with the rationing overseen by the military, Reuters reported on Sunday as fuel shortages begin to bite deeper.As local crude oil production continues to fallw and refineries operate much below capacity and as the flow of diluents necessary to produce fuels from Venezuelan superheavy dries up, fuel shortages were a crisis waiting to happen.Last week, PDVSA documents and shipping data from Reuters showed that imports of fuel and diluents that are necessary to make Venezuela’s extra heavy refinable into fuels have since the start of the month dropped to 86,000 bpd from 225,000 bpd for April as U.S. sanctions bit deeper.



At the same time, according to another PDVSA document cited by S&P Global Platts, crude oil production in the Orinoco Belt has fallen by as much as 77 percent to 169,800 bpd since the start of May.An additional event that further aggravated the fuel situation was an outage at the Cardon refinery—the second-largest in the country—which stopped operations last Wednesday. The refinery has a capacity of 310,000 bpd of crude oil.According to the Reuters report from Sunday, the rationing and the long wait times to fill up the tank have sparked additional protests in some cities besides the action led by the opposition. Some people said they had waited for days to fill up.



Even so, Caracas seems to have been spared from the long queues for fuel, at least for the time being. According to Reuters, there were few signs the fuel shortages were creeping closer to the capital.Meanwhile, after last week talks began between the Maduro government and the Venezuelan opposition in Norway, the Financial Times reported that opposition leader Juan Guaido had hired a debt restructuring veteran probably in anticipation of a regimen change. This is not good news for creditors, according to the FT, as it suggests Guaido, if he takes power, would take a tough approach to lenders.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Why China Hasn’t Slapped Tariffs On U.S. Oil ImportsWhy Oil Is Still UnderpricedIran’s Trick To Sell Oil For A 30% Premium

Western oil majors Total and Eni have suspended payments to the Russian companies that sold them contaminated crude via the Druzhba pipeline, in a new controversy in what trading sources described to Reuters as the “biggest Russian oil supply disruption ever.”  Last month, Russia halted supplies via the Druzhba oil pipeline to several European countries due to a contamination issue, which the Russians say was deliberate.  The oil was contaminated with organic chlorine, a substance used in oil production to boost output but dangerous in high amounts for refining equipment. The amounts of the chemical were found to be at levels much higher than the maximum allowable amount.



According to Russia’s energy ministry, normal deliveries via the pipeline are expected to resume in the second half of May.Russian pipeline operator Transneft will compensate its customers for the losses they have sustained due to the contaminated crude oil, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Kozak said last week, noting that refiners must first prove their damage and loss in order to claim compensation.The supplies via the Druzhba pipeline are made according to Russian law, under which buyers first pay, and if they are not satisfied with the quality of the crude, they can claim damages and compensations.Related: U.S. Oil Rig Count Dips To 14-Month Low



According to Reuters’ trading sources, western companies, including Eni and Total, have informed their Russian suppliers, including Rosneft, that they won’t be paying for the contaminated oil payments that were due on May 15. The western buyers are ready to pay when the damages become clear and when supplies of clean oil restart, Reuters sources say.The Russian oil supply contamination has disrupted the refinery operations of some companies. Total, for example, halted last week some of the units at its 230,000-bpd Leuna refinery in Germany to conduct technical checks. On Thursday, Total declared force majeure on shipments of refined oil products from the Leuna refinery.Meanwhile, commodity trading houses Vitol and Unipec are said to be trying to sell some of the contaminated Russian crude refused by European refiners to Asian buyers. Chinese independent refiners are the main target buyers, but no one is sure how much the crude should cost, how much it would cost to dilute it with clean oil to reduce the chlorine levels, and if it can be refined at all, trading sources tell Reuters.   By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:The Single Most Bullish Indicator For OilOn The Cusp Of War: Why Iran Won’t FoldBank Of America: $90 Brent May Be Around Corner

The Houthi rebels in Yemen said over the weekend that last week’s attack on an Aramco oil pipeline in Saudi Arabia was the start of military operations against some 300 vital military targets in the Kingdom and in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).The Houthis have identified targets such as military headquarters and facilities in the UAE and in Saudi Arabia, as well as their bases in Yemen, Houthi-controlled SABA news agency reported on Sunday, quoting a source in the military of the rebel movement.   Saudi Arabia and Iran are essentially fighting a proxy war in Yemen, where the Saudis lead a military Arab coalition to “restore legitimacy” in the country, while the Houthi movement, which holds the capital Sanaa, is backed by Iran.Over the past week, tension in the region has dramatically escalated with Houthis claiming responsibility for a drone attack on an oil pipeline in Saudi Arabia.



Two pumping stations along Aramco’s East-West oil pipeline in Saudi Arabia were attacked by explosive-laden drones last week, the official Saudi Press Agency (SPA) reported, citing Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih, who described the attack as one of “terrorism and sabotage.”This statement came out hours after Houthi-owned TV Almasirah reported that “7 Drones have targeted vital Saudi facilities.”Reports of the drone attack on Saudi Aramco’s oil infrastructure came a day after Saudi Arabia said that two of its oil tankers were attacked by saboteurs near the UAE, while the UAE said that a total four vessels were attacked off its coast at the port of Fujairah.Related: Global Oil Shipping Concerns Rise Over Middle East TensionsThe Saudi-led coalition conducted air strikes on Yemen’s capital Sanaa on Thursday, targeting bases of the Iran-aligned Houthis.



The heightened tension in the Middle East and the U.S.-Iran standoff have been supporting oil prices in recent days, outweighing bearish factors such as concerns over an escalating U.S-China trade war or slowing global economic growth.On Sunday, Adel bin Ahmed Al-Jubeir, Saudi Arabia’s Minister of the State for Foreign Affairs, said, as carried by the official Saudi Press Agency:“The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia does not want a war in the region and does not seek to do so and will do its utmost to prevent this war, while stressing that if the other side chooses war, the Kingdom will respond firmly and decisively and will defend itself and its interests.”By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:The Fear Factor Is Back For OilIran’s Trick To Sell Oil For A 30% PremiumWhy Oil Is Still Underpriced

Market manipulation could be behind the fact that California drivers pay more for gasoline than the rest of the country, the Lost Angeles Times reports, citing a statement by the California Energy Commission.“The Energy Commission has identified a number of possible causes that could explain the residual price increase in California, ranging from refinery outages to potentially market manipulation,” the statement, sent to Governor Gavin Newsom, said.The commissions said it has identified several possible reasons for the fact that as of Friday, drivers in California paid an average of US$4.05 per gallon of gasoline, which was US$1.20 higher than the national average. Besides market manipulation, the reasons also included refinery outages.



The commission noted prices in California began climbing noticeably higher than the national average in 2015 following an outage at a refinery in Torrence, which continued for more than a year. According to one hypothesis, the price trend could be at least in part a residual result of this outage.Another possible reason, according to the commission, is the “practice of higher-priced brand retailers of gasoline — Chevron, Shell, Exxon, Mobil, and 76 — to charge higher prices than unbranded, ARCO and hypermart retailers, for essentially the same product.”“While this practice is not necessarily illegal, it may be an effort of a segment of the market to artificially inflate prices to the detriment of California consumers and could account for at least part of the price differential,” the regulator said.



Yet according to a Republican legislator the cause of the higher prices is the gas tax that Californians have to pay. “We know the most obvious cause of high gas prices and that’s the gas tax that was voted by Democrats two years ago, with more increases coming,” Marie Waldon said.California currently has the second-highest gas tax in the United States, second only to Pennsylvania.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Why Oil Is Still UnderpricedThe Fear Factor Is Back For OilThe 2 Energy Giants Reshaping The Middle East

The enormous debt of Mexico’s state oil firm Pemex has not increased since the new administration took office in December 2018, and will not increase in the future, Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said on Friday.“The debt hasn’t grown during our time, and it’s not going to grow,” Reuters quoted López Obrador as saying at a press conference.The Mexican state oil firm has a total of US$106 billion in financial debt, which makes it the world’s most indebted oil company.Left-wing President López Obrador—in office since December 1—wants a greater role for Pemex in reversing the downward trend in Mexican oil production.



Pemex’s crude oil production has declined in recent years—according to Pemex figures, its crude oil production averaged 1.813 million bpd in 2018. To compare, Pemex’s crude oil production averaged 2.429 million bpd in 2014, falling to 1.948 million bpd in 2017.Apart from boosting oil production and Pemex’s role in Mexico, López Obrador bets on a major new oil refinery as part of his goal for “energy independence.”Last week, Mexico scrapped plans to tender the construction of the refinery to foreign companies, saying that it would be Pemex that will oversee the project. According to López Obrador, the foreign firms won’t be able to meet the government deadline to have the project ready by 2022 and weren’t happy with the US$8-billion price tag.“The company has secured the financial, technical, human and material resources necessary to complete the project,” Pemex said in a statement last week. According to Pemex and López Obrador, the entire project will cost US$8.3 billion (160 billion Mexican pesos) and will create 100,000 jobs. Construction is scheduled to begin on June 2 this year and is expected to conclude in May 2022.



Analysts, however, doubt that Mexico could complete the project on time and on budget, which could put additional strain on government and Pemex finances.According to Moody’s, the project is expected to exceed the planned budget—in a big way, because of Mexico’s “limited know-how” in such large-scale ventures.

Saudi Arabia may soak up some of Iran’s previous market share on the Indian market as Saudi Aramco is set to ship additional 2 million barrels per month to Indian Oil Corp between July and December this year on top of the existing term supply deal between the two companies.   “We have told them we will be taking 2 million barrels every month for six months from July (about 1.6 million tons in total) and they have agreed,” A K Sharma, Indian Oil’s director (finance), told Reuters on Friday.India, Iran’s second largest oil customer after China, was one of the eight countries that were granted six-month waivers to continue buying oil from Iran after the U.S. re-imposed sanctions on the Iranian oil industry in November. The United States, however, pursued a maximum pressure campaign against Iran last month and put an end to all sanction waivers for all Iranian oil buyers.



This put Indian refiners in a position to source the market for alternatives, and many of them, especially private companies, did, because they are wary of possible secondary U.S. sanctions if they continue to buy oil from Iran.Indian Oil Corp has a term deal with Saudi Aramco to buy a total of 5.6 million tons in the financial year 2019/2020, plus an option to buy another 2 million tons, according to Reuters.  Indian Oil diversified its crude suppliers in the 2018/2019 fiscal year, and entered for the first time in a term contract to source oil from the United States, boosting its capabilities to process crude grades from a wider and cheaper basket, the company said in its annual results on Friday.Related: Putin Could Cut His Loss As Venezuelan Oil Output Nosedives



Despite the fact that Indian Oil has asked for extra Saudi supply, Indian refiners as a group are said not to be rushing into buying extra crude from the Kingdom.Just one Indian refiner has agreed to buy additional crude oil supply from Saudi Arabia to compensate for the loss of Iranian barrels, as India’s firms have been looking for months to diversify their crude sources and as the Kingdom raised its prices to Asia to take advantage of the supply crunch.Of the four state-held Indian refiners that bought Iranian oil under the sanction waivers, Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals (MRPL) is the only one to have taken up the Saudi’s offer for additional crude, industry sources told Reuters on Monday.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Middle East Tensions Put Oil Markets On EdgePeak Gasoline Vehicles Is Already HereStalemate In Libya Could Cause Next Major Oil Supply Outage

A month before OPEC and allies are set to discuss the future of their production cut deal, the leader of the non-OPEC group, Russia, appears to have finally fallen in line with its share of the cuts, producing below its OPEC+ quota for the month of May.  Russia’s oil production between May 1 and 16 averaged 11.156 million bpd, Reuters reported on Friday, quoting two industry sources, which means that Moscow is now below its quota under the production cut deal.As part of the OPEC+ production cuts between January and June, Russia is taking the lion’s share of the non-OPEC cuts and pledged to reduce production by 230,000 bpd from October’s post-Soviet record level of 11.421 million bpd, to 11.191 million bpd.



In the first twelve days of May, Russia’s crude oil production was said to have averaged 11.16 million bpd, although the decline in production may have been the result of restricted exports via the Druzhba oil pipeline due to a contamination issue.Last month, Russia halted supplies via the Druzhba oil pipeline to several European countries due to a contamination issue, which the Russians say was deliberate. Russian production has been curtailed because of the restricted exports via the Druzhba pipeline. Estimates that Russia is finally within its quota under the OPEC+ deal come days before a panel of ministers from OPEC and Russia are scheduled to meet this weekend in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, to discuss the state of the oil market and review compliance with the cuts.  



At this weekend’s meeting, discussion could revolve around a possible production increase after the end of the U.S. sanction waivers to all Iranian oil buyers. Talk of raising—instead of cutting—production would be in line with Russia’s ambition to resume pumping more as its companies benefit from higher production as much as from higher oil prices and have seen their new field production plans stalled by Russia’s commitments to the OPEC+ deals.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Middle East Tensions Put Oil Markets On EdgeU.S. Oil Rig Count Dips To 14-Month LowStalemate In Libya Could Cause Next Major Oil Supply Outage

France’s Total has halted some of the units at its 230,000-bpd Leuna refinery in Germany to conduct technical checks after contaminated Russian crude oil was found to have flown via an oil pipeline from Russia to European customers. The Leuna refinery, which typically receives Russian Urals crude via the Druzhba oil pipeline, is expected to resume operations as early as on Saturday and will use alternative supply via Gdansk in Poland, Reuters quoted the French oil and gas major as saying in a statement on Friday.“With the continuing problems in connection with the Druzhba pipeline, the capacity of the refinery will remain limited,” Total said.



Last month, Russia halted supplies via the Druzhba oil pipeline to several European countries, including Germany, due to a contamination issue, which the Russians say was deliberate.  The oil was contaminated with organic chlorine, a substance used in oil production to boost output but dangerous in high amounts for refining equipment. The amounts of the chemical were found to be at levels much higher than the maximum allowable amount.According to Russia’s energy ministry, normal deliveries via the pipeline are expected to resume in the second half of May.



The contamination issue with Russian oil pipeline supply will impact European refinery runs to the tune of 250,000 bpd in the second quarter, which is below 2 percent of Europe’s refined oil product demand, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).On Thursday, Total declared force majeure on shipments of refined oil products from the Leuna refinery after the suspension of the oil flow via the Druzhba pipeline.Russian pipeline operator Transneft will compensate its customers for the losses they have sustained due to the contaminated crude oil, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Kozak said on Thursday, noting that refiners must first prove their damage and loss in order to claim compensation.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Oil Rises After Drone Attacks On Saudi InfrastructureThe Battle For Control Over Iraq’s OilThe Marijuana Industry’s Dirty Little Secret

Venezuela’s crisis and plunging oil production impact countries in the Caribbean as well, as most people in the poorest nation in the Western hemisphere, Haiti, now have electricity just three hours a day, after Venezuela stopped sending cheap oil to the country.Under Petrocaribe—a program to gain influence in the Caribbean and Central America—Venezuela was shipping very cheap oil to countries in the region in exchange for their support. The collapse of Venezuela’s economy and oil production, however, put an end to the very favorable pricing of oil products to the previous beneficiaries of the Petrocaribe program, including Haiti.  Without the cheap oil from Venezuela, Haiti’s economy and everyday activities are in disarray because in most areas, people have electricity only for three hours a day, AP’s Ralph Thomassaint Joseph reports.



Gas stations are empty, hospitals have to run on backup generators, and people find it difficult to go to work or send their kids to school, as the fuel crisis has been worsening without cheap Venezuelan oil, while the government struggles to finance fuel purchases on the open market.  Haiti has seen its fuel supply increasingly challenged since the collapse of the Petrocaribe program.Haiti had received almost 70 percent of its fuel from Venezuela at the peak of the Petrocaribe program, under which Venezuela offered very attractive financing to Caribbean nations to buy its refined oil products.



However, after the Petrocaribe program collapsed last year, Haiti was forced to turn to international markets for its fuel supply. But without the Petrocaribe financing for oil, the Caribbean nation has been struggling to find enough U.S. dollars to pay for the product deliveries, and suppliers aren’t having it.Physical oil supply and trading company Novum Energy Trading Corp suspended earlier this year fuel cargoes bound for Haiti because of overdue payments.This has exacerbated the fuel and energy crisis in the Caribbean country, which now risks recession amid double-digit annual inflation, while a gallon of gasoline sells for as much as $12 on the black market.  By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Stalemate In Libya Could Cause Next Major Oil Supply OutageMystery Tanker With Iranian Oil Unloads In ChinaUndeterred By Peak Oil, Saudis Look To Become World’s Largest Oil Trader

Another problem has been added to Venezuela’s growing list of woes: gasoline import shortages that have caused lines at gas stations, Reuters reports, adding that local production has slumped too as the second-largest refinery in the country stopped operating.PDVSA documents and shipping data from Reuters show that imports of fuel and diluents that are necessary to make Venezuela’s extra heavy refinable into fuels have since the start of the month dropped to 86,000 bpd from 225,000 bpd for April as U.S. sanctions bite deeper.



At the same time, the Cardon oil refinery, which has been operating at well below capacity even before the sanctions were introduced in January, halted operations because of damage to some of its units, Reuters quoted a local source as saying. Cardon has a capacity of 310,000 bpd but was processing just 115,000 bpd.The news of the refinery suspension and the gas station lines comes on the heels of another update regarding production this time. Earlier this week, sources from Venezuela told Reuters none of its four heavy oil upgraders were operating as there was a shortage of buyers for the country’s crude after it lost its largest market in the U.S.



The report follows another one, by S&P Global Platts, which quoted a PDVSA report as saying production in the Orinoco Belt—the region where most of Venezuela’s oil riches are concentrated—had dropped to 169,800 bpd since the start of May. However, the reason given for the slump in that report was not the lack of buyers but rather the lack of tankers to carry the crude abroad.Indeed, Venezuela has a barter deal with China and Russia that obliges it to repay sizeable loans with crude. However, the U.S. sanctions have targeted shippers, too, as part of the drive to remove Nicolas Maduro from power, and these have apparently heeded the warning.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Why Oil Stock Dividends Are Soaring This YearCan The U.S. Steal Gas Market Share From Russia?OPEC To Meet In Saudi Arabia To Discuss ‘Oil Supply Security’

China has issued a new batch of oil product export quotas and they are 5.3 percent higher than they were this time last year as the country’s refineries return to processing record-high amounts of crude oil.S&P Global Platts reports the total amount of the quotas is 23.79 million tons under the general trade route. Added to the oil product export quotas under the processing route, the total that Chinese refiners can export comes in at 45.29 million tons since the beginning of the year. That’s up from 43 million tons a year ago.



Of the total, the biggest share is for gasoline, at 9.09 million tons. Next is gasoil with quotas for 9.175 million tons, and last is jet fuel, the export quota for which is 5.525 million tons, all under the general trade route that covers CNPC, Sinopec, CNOOC, Sinochem, and China National Aviation Fuel.Now Beijing is due to issue the second batch of 2019 oil product export quotas under the processing trade route, which allows refiners exporting fuels to not pay taxes on the exported goods. The first batch of the quotas under this route amounted to 3.14 million tons and the first batch of general trade route quotas totaled 18.36 million tons.



Earlier this week, Chinese government data showed refiners were processing crude oil at the rate of 12.68 million bpd as of the end of April, up 5 percent from a year ago and a record high. According to a January report by CNPC, 12.68 million bpd was to be the average processing rate in China this year.There has been mounting concern among refiners in other Asian countries that surplus fuel production in China would spill into neighboring countries, undermining the profit margins of local refiners. The increase in export quotas, however, suggests this is not a concern shared by Beijing.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Why Oil Stock Dividends Are Soaring This YearOPEC To Meet In Saudi Arabia To Discuss ‘Oil Supply Security’The IEA's Dire Warning For Energy Markets

The Saudi-led coalition conducted air strikes on Yemen’s capital Sanaa on Thursday, targeting bases of the Iran-aligned Houthis after the Houthis claimed responsibility for the drone attacks on an oil pipeline in Saudi Arabia earlier this week.Saudi Arabia and Iran are essentially fighting a proxy war in Yemen, where the Saudis lead a military Arab coalition to “restore legitimacy” in the country, while the Houthi movement, which holds the capital Sanaa, is backed by Iran.Two pumping stations along Aramco’s East-West oil pipeline in Saudi Arabia were attacked by explosive-laden drones in the early morning local time on Tuesday, the official Saudi Press Agency (SPA) reported, citing Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih, who described the attack as one of “terrorism and sabotage.”“These attacks prove again that it is important for us to face terrorist entities, including the Houthi militias in Yemen that are backed by Iran,” al-Falih said on Tuesday.



This statement came out hours after Houthi-owned TV Almasirah reported that “7 Drones have targeted vital Saudi facilities.”Reports of the drone attack on Saudi Aramco’s oil infrastructure came a day after Saudi Arabia said that two of its oil tankers were attacked by saboteurs near the United Arab Emirates (UAE), while the UAE said that a total four vessels were attacked off its coast at the port of FujairahAccording to the Houthi-owned Almasirah news outlet, Thursday’s air strikes on Sanaa killed six people, including four children, and wounded 52 others.Related: Why Oil Stock Dividends Are Soaring This YearThe Saudi Press Agency said that the Saudi-led coalition carried out “air operations on a number of legitimate military targets; which military intelligence confirmed are military bases and facilities used by the Iranian-backed Houthi militias for weapons and ammunition storage.”

Canada’s Senate Standing Committee on Transportation has voted to defeat the controversial Oil Tanker Moratorium Act that opponents of the bill view as damaging to Canada’s oil industry, according to a statement by the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP) released on Thursday.The senate committee is recommending that the federal government discard the bill entirely.



CAPP’s statement reads in part, “This almost exclusively targets Canada’s energy sector and would block the possibility of export of Canadian petroleum production to international markets.”Canada’s oil industry has been hit particularly hard since the 2014 oil price crash by and large due to the insufficient export capacity, recently receiving yet another blow when production cuts were enforced to shore up the expanding discount of WCS relative to WTI.



While the recent uptick in oil prices has softened the blow to Canada’s oil industry, the lack of export capacity has stifled growth as fewer industry players are willing to sink money into adding oil production capacity when it may have difficulty transporting it. According to CAPP, the total capital investment in Canada’s oil and natural gas sector is forecast to drop to $37 billion in 2019 compared to $81 billion in 2014.The Oil Tanker Moratorium Act sought to ban tankers carrying more than 12,500 metric tons of oil from stopping or unloading along B.C.’s northern coast. Alberta has been a strong detractor of the bill that would stifle its oil industry by further restricting oil transportation in the country. The bill did not extend to LNG tankers. And while the bill looked to limit Canadian oil sailing through northern B.C., it would have allowed foreign tankers traveling through the area—a sticking point that has enraged Alberta.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:OPECs Spare Capacity Could Be Put To The TestThe Battle For Control Over Iraq’s OilThe Marijuana Industry’s Dirty Little Secret

For the first time, the Bank of Canada ranks climate change as a key weak spot in the Canadian financial system and economy, as a growing number of governments start to warn of the risks to the planet and economy that global warming brings.  The Bank of Canada’s Financial System Review—2019, published on Thursday, lists six vulnerabilities in the Canadian financial system, and for the first time climate change made the list. According to the bank, the six top vulnerabilities are: high level of household indebtedness, imbalances in the housing market, cyber threats and financial interconnections, fragile corporate debt funding from certain markets, climate change, and rapid change in crypto-asset markets.“Climate change continues to pose risks to both the economy and the financial system. These include physical risks from disruptive weather events and transition risks from adapting to a lower-carbon global economy,” the Bank of Canada said in its review, adding that it is undertaking a multi-year research plan to better assess the risks from climate change that are relevant to its mandate.



According to Canada’s central bank, “Limited understanding and mispricing of climate-related risks could potentially increase the costs of transitioning to a low-carbon economy.”The bank noted that few firms disclose the financial impact of climate change on their assets and operations, and even these disclosures are not universal. In addition, mispriced assets due to lack of information on carbon exposure could later result in repricing of assets. However, “rapid repricing might cause fire sales and interact with other vulnerabilities—like excessive leverage—destabilizing the financial system,” the bank said.Earlier this month, Ireland declared a climate emergency, with Climate Action Minister Richard Bruton calling climate change the greatest challenge mankind is facing.



The move, which followed cross-party support to amendments to a climate action report drafted by the parliament, made Ireland the second country in the world to declare a climate emergency after the UK. In the latter, the declaration followed crippling environmentalist protests in London that paralyzed parts of the city.  By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:The IEA's Dire Warning For Energy MarketsOPECs Spare Capacity Could Be Put To The TestGlobal Oil Flows At Stake In New Middle East Proxy War

An “unplanned operational issue” at the Chevron Phillips plant at Baytown, Texas, occurred on Thursday morning, the Houston Chronicle reports, citing company officials and showing photos of thick black smoke rising from the plant.There is no danger to any plant employees or the community, company officials said in a post on the Community Awareness Emergency Response, (CAER) Online portal, where plants can post advisories about events or incidents.According to company officials, cited by the Houston Chronicle, the company is working “to minimize noise, light or smoke” after the unplanned operational issue.The incident comes two months after a fire at the Intercontinental Terminals Company (ITC) storage site at Deer Park, Texas, which blazed for days and halted some ship traffic at the Houston port. Back then, residents of Deer Park and Galena Park were told to stay indoors, and schools canceled classes for several days.



In December 2018, Chevron Phillips Chemical said that it had successfully started up operations of a new ethane cracker at its Cedar Bayou facility in Baytown.Chevron Phillips Chemical aims to expand the chemical operations with a project estimated to be worth US$5.8 billion that would create 3,500 construction jobs.Earlier this month, Greg Garland, chief executive at Phillips 66, told the annual shareholders’ meeting that Chevron and Phillips 66 were still evaluating sites about the multi-billion-dollar expansion, the HoustonChronicle reported.



The Sweeny and Orange locations are emerging as front runners, according to Garland, because the Cedar Bayou location in Baytown already has an ethane cracker and could face limitations in permitting. Cedar Bayou is also close to an ExxonMobil ethane cracker in the area.Chevron and Phillips 66 are expected to make a final investment decision on the expansion project next year, and potentially start up the new facility in 2023 or 2024, Garland said.

The Environmental Protection Agency relaxed rules for refiners under the Renewable Fuel Standard at its own discretion before a court ruled in favor of such a relaxation, Reuters reports citing documents that have not been released before as well as a government source.According to the documents and the source, the rule change came into effect at least four months before a court ruling that the Trump administration cites to the corn industry as basis for its move to relax the rules that saved refineries hundreds of millions of dollars. This, according to Reuters’ source, was the purpose of the early change as well.



The revelation will likely cause anger in the corn industry, which has been pushing for the opposite of what the refining lobby wants, that is, requirements for more ethanol in fuel. The issue has basically put the administration between a rock and a hard place as the interests of the oil and the corn lobbies are at irreconcilable odds.The EPA finalized the Renewable Fuel Standard, which is part of the 2007 Energy Independence and Security Act, in 2016. Under the terms of the standard, all refiners are obligated to blend their gasoline with ethanol, but smaller facilities can win an exemption if they can prove that blending gasoline with ethanol would harm them financially. Indeed, refiners have spent billions on compliance with the standard, so it’s not surprising that ever since its entry into effect, refiners and corn producers have been pushing for their respective interests and they have been getting results.



The early rule change revealed by Reuters is the latest example of this. It followed a requirement set out by the EPA in the then brand new Renewable Fuel Standard that 15 billion gallons of ethanol be produced in 2017 alone. Although short of an earlier annual production requirement, the 2016 one was praised by the corn industry. For reference, one bushel of corn produces around 2.8 gallons of ethanol. By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Putin Could Cut His Loss As Venezuelan Oil Output NosedivesGlobal Oil Flows At Stake In New Middle East Proxy WarThe Marijuana Industry’s Dirty Little Secret

Venezuela has stopped upgrading crude oil as PDVSA finds itself without buyers in the wake of US sanctions, according to sources who spoke to Reuters.Venezuela hasn’t shut down its upgraders completely, instead, leaving some of them running without producing new oil in order to prevent damage to the facilities.The upgraders are responsible for upgrading the Latin American nation’s extra-heavy Orinoco oil into lighter-weight grades that are more palatable for foreign buyers—buyers which have now moved on to other suppliers in their efforts to not run afoul of the US sanctions levied against Venezuela as the United States looks to choke off Venezuela’s primary income stream to effect a change in leadership.



The upgraders in question are owned in part by Chevron, Total, Equinor, and Rosneft. Only one crude processing facility remains producing, which blends Orinoco with lighter grades according to Reuters. That facility produces just 70,000 bpd.One of these joint ventures with Chevron, Petropiar, that processes this extra-heavy crude oil, had to drastically reduce production in April, according to Bloomberg, producing 74,000 bpd in the first two weeks of April, a 44% decline in production for Petropiar in the first two weeks of January. Petropiar has in the past been one of Venezuela’s top producers.Venezuela’s oil production fell to just 768,000 barrels per day in April 2019.



As Venezuela’s oil exports plummet to new lows, it is finding itself short on storage space, sending yet another bullish signal to the market after oil attacks over the weekend targeted oil tankers near the Strait of Hormuz, drone attacks on an Aramco oil pipeline, and security issues in Iraq that has caused foreign oil companies to take a hard look at the risks associated with staying in country.WTI was trading up on the flurry of bullish news, offset in part by crude oil inventory builds in the United States according to the EIA and concerns that the escalating China/US trade war will dampen demand for crude.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Putin Could Cut His Loss As Venezuelan Oil Output NosedivesEnergy Megaprojects In Jeopardy As Trade War EscalatesRussia Aims To Exploit Africa’s Energy Potential

Most of the solar cells made at Tesla’s solar factory in Buffalo, New York, are being exported instead of being installed on U.S. homes as originally planned, as Tesla continues to struggle on the American solar market, Reuters reported on Wednesday, citing sources at the factory and documents it has reviewed.Tesla entered the solar power business with the acquisition of SolarCity in 2016, sparking concern among investors and industry observers that it was stretching itself too thin.   Tesla said in late 2016 that it had finalized an agreement with Panasonic to begin manufacturing photovoltaic (PV) cells and modules at the Buffalo, NY, factory.



Originally, the solar cells from the Buffalo factory were intended for the ‘Solar Roof’ solution that Tesla is offering.“As part of the agreement, Panasonic will cover required capital costs in Buffalo and Tesla is making a long-term purchase commitment from Panasonic,” Tesla said back in December 2016.However, according to an employee at the Buffalo factory who spoke to Reuters, Tesla has sporadically bought solar cells from its partner Panasonic. Most of the cells manufactured at the U.S. site are being exported to foreign buyers, according to a letter from Panasonic to U.S. customs officials that Reuters has seen.



The number of Tesla’s Solar Roof system installations has not lived up to initial expectations, as 21 systems were connected in California, according to state data cited by Reuters. A few others have been installed in the northeast of the U.S., a former Tesla employee familiar with the matter told Reuters. The employee was laid off in personnel cuts earlier this year.  Tesla’s solar sales slumped by 36 percent quarterly and by 38 percent annually in Q1 2019, according to the company’s Q1 update.Last month, Tesla was said to be cutting the prices of its solar panels by as much as 38 percent below the national average in a bid to regain ground in the solar market.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Energy Megaprojects In Jeopardy As Trade War EscalatesGlobal Oil Flows At Stake In New Middle East Proxy WarTrump’s New Plan To Spark A California Oil Boom

ExxonMobil is starting to evacuate its engineers working on Iraq’s West Qurna 1 field due to security concerns, according to Al Arabiya. Earlier in the day, S&P Global Platts reported that ExxonMobil was closely monitoring” the situation in Iraq, adding that BP and Chevron were also watching the situation closely.The exodus from Iraq comes after the United States ordered on Wednesday the evacuation of all non-essential government employees from Iraq citing security concerns, adding that the US embassy in Iraq would suspend visa services and would have a “limited ability to provide emergency services to US citizens in Iraq.”



The US State Department said on Wednesday in a Level 4 travel advisory that US citizens in Iraq are at a “high risk for violence and kidnapping. Numerous terrorist and insurgent groups are active in Iraq and regularly attack both Iraqi security forces and civilians. Anti-U.S. sectarian militias may also threaten U.S. citizens and Western companies throughout Iraq. Attacks by improvised explosive devices (IEDs) occur in many areas of the country, including Baghdad.”Last week, Iraq said it was close to signing a $53-billion deal with ExxonMobil and PetroChina, which would land Iraq $400 billion over the 30-year deal period. Exxon also signed six Production Sharing Contracts covering more than 848,000 acres in Iraq’s Kurdistan region, according to Exxon’s website.



In addition to BP, Chevron, and ExxonMobil, foreign oil companies including Eni, Rosneft, Lukoil, Gazprom, CNPC, CNOOC, and Total also operate in the now restive region, among others.Iraq is a major oil producer and is OPEC’s No.2, producing 4.630 million bpd in April according to OPEC’s most recent Monthly Oil Market Report. If Iraq’s oil production is disrupted as a result of foreign oil company personnel exiting the country, it will further add to other OPEC production losses in Venezuela and Iran at a time when the market is already skittish due to attacks in the region on four oil tankers and Aramco’s oil pipeline.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Oil Rises After Drone Attacks On Saudi InfrastructureThe Battle For Control Over Iraq’s OilThe Marijuana Industry’s Dirty Little Secret

The UK’s goal to maximize oil and gas recovery from the North Sea will harm the country’s Paris Agreement climate goals, a new report by climate campaign groups showed on Wednesday.   The UK’s petroleum reserves remain at a significant level, with overall remaining recoverable reserves and resources ranging from 10 to 20 billion barrels plus of oil equivalent, according to the UK Oil and Gas Authority (OGA). Currently proven and probable reserves on the UK Continental Shelf (UKCS) can sustain production for another 20 years.The UKCS yielded 20 percent more oil and gas in the last five years after 14 consecutive years of production declines, the industry’s association, Oil and Gas UK, said in its latest annual Business Outlook earlier this year.The UK and Scottish governments, together with oil and gas industry associations, aim to find, develop, and operate reserves that could add a generation of productive life to the North Sea.



But environmental organizations warned in their report published today that the UK would miss the Paris Agreement goals if the industry were to intensify production.“The UK’s 5.7 billion barrels of oil and gas in already-operating oil and gas fields will exceed the UK’s share in relation to Paris climate goals - whereas industry and government aim to extract 20 billion barrels,” is one of the key findings of the report written by Platform, Oil Change International, and Friends of the Earth Scotland.  “Recent subsidies for oil and gas extraction will add twice as much carbonto the atmosphere as the phase-out of coal power saves,” the authors of the report note. Related: Saudi Tanker Attack Reveals Oil Market Weakness



The report also recommends that the UK and Scottish governments “Stop issuing licenses and permits for new oil and gas exploration and development, and revoke undeveloped licenses,” among other things, including implementing a plan to transition to clean energy and to a clean energy industry and jobs.“Climate science is clear that we urgently need to phase out fossil fuels, yet the government and big oil are doing everything they can to squeeze every last drop out of the North Sea. To tackle the climate emergency head on we must ban oil and gas exploration now, and redirect the vast subsidies propping up fossil fuel extraction towards creating decent jobs in a clean energy economy,” Mary Church, Head of Campaigns at Friends of the Earth Scotland, said, commenting on the report.   By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Energy Megaprojects In Jeopardy As Trade War EscalatesChinese Oil Refineries Return To Record-High ProductionWhy Oil Stock Dividends Are Soaring This Year

The contamination issue with Russian oil pipeline supply will impact European refinery runs to the tune of 250,000 bpd in the second quarter, which is below 2 percent of Europe’s refined oil product demand, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).Last month, Russia halted supplies via the Druzhba oil pipeline to several European countries due to a contamination issue, which the Russians say was deliberate. Russian production has been curtailed because of the restricted exports via the Druzhba pipeline. Hungary, Poland, and the Czech Republic were said earlier this month to be releasing a total of 8 million barrels from their respective strategic petroleum reserves to keep refineries operating after the contaminated crude oil forced the shutdown of the pipeline.



The oil was contaminated with organic chlorine, a substance used in oil production to boost output but dangerous in high amounts for refining equipment. The amounts of the chemical were found to be at levels much higher than the maximum allowable amount.According to Russia’s energy ministry, normal deliveries via the pipeline are expected to resume in the second half of May. Poland’s refiners PKN Orlen and Grupa Lotos said on Tuesday that they expected to start receiving in the coming days crude oil with normal quality via the Druzhba pipeline.



In its Oil Market Report on Wednesday, the IEA said that apart from the growing supply concerns in the Middle East, it is also monitoring the impact of the contamination of Russian crude oil passing through the 1.4-million-bpd Druzhba pipeline system.“The issue will be resolved in due course, eased by commercial and government stock draws by Russia’s customers. One consequence could be a loss of confidence in the quality of the crude flows and thus a search, where feasible, for alternative supplies that could intensify price pressures for heavy/medium sour crude oil,” the IEA said.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Occidental Petroleum, Anadarko Seal The DealLibya’s $60 Billion Push To Double Oil ProductionThe Shale Boom Is About To Go Bust

Saudi Aramco restarted pumping oil on Wednesday through the pipeline which was hit by drone attacks on Tuesday, Arab media report.Two pumping stations along Aramco’s East-West oil pipeline in Saudi Arabia were attacked by explosive-laden drones in the early morning local time on Tuesday, the official Saudi Press Agency (SPA) reported yesterday, citing Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih, who described the attack as one of “terrorism and sabotage.”The drones laden with explosives targeted the pump stations on the pipeline which carries oil from eastern Saudi Arabia to the Yanbu port.



Saudi Aramco issued a statement on Tuesday, saying that the sabotage caused minor damage and a fire at one of the pumping stations. Aramco temporarily shut down the pipeline yesterday as a precautionary measure and noted that no injuries or fatalities were reported. The company’s oil and gas supplies haven’t been impacted as a result of the incident either, it said.“Mr. Al-Falih confirmed that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia condemns this cowardly attack, emphasizing that this act of terrorism and sabotage in addition to recent acts in the Arabian Gulf do not only target the Kingdom but also the security of world oil supplies and the global economy. These attacks prove again that it is important for us to face terrorist entities, including the Houthi militias in Yemen that are backed by Iran,” the official Saudi agency said on Tuesday.Related: The Battle For Control Over Iraq’s OilThis statement came out hours after Houthi-owned TV Almasirah reported that “7 Drones have targeted vital Saudi facilities.”



Reports of the drone attack on Saudi Aramco’s oil infrastructure came a day after Saudi Arabia said that two of its oil tankers were attacked by saboteurs near the United Arab Emirates (UAE), while the UAE said that a total four vessels were attacked off its coast at the port of Fujairah.  The heightened security concerns and the potential threat to global oil supplies in the Middle East lifted oil prices on Monday and early Tuesday, outweighing concerns about an escalating U.S.-China trade war and slowing global economic growth. A large crude build reported by API later on Tuesday, however, weighed down on oil prices, which were still down just before the EIA’s inventory report release on Wednesday.

South Korea imported some 353,000 bpd of Iranian crude last month, up 17 percent on March ahead of the removal of sanction waivers that granted South Korea and another seven countries to legally import certain amounts of Iranian crude despite U.S. sanctions.A month earlier, South Korea’s imports of Iranian crude reached 1.2 million tons, or 8.8 million barrels which was a 23-percent increase on February and a fivefold increase on January, when Korean refiners resumed their purchases of Iranian crude.



Reuters reports the monthly rise will be followed by a sharp drop this month as Washington did not renew the sanction waivers for Iranian oil importers. The picture would be the same for Japan as the two are the staunchest U.S. allies in Asia and have been careful to maintain their traditionally strong relationship with Washington.Both South Korea and Japan stopped importing Iranian oil well before the U.S. sanctions snapped back last November and then they waited for a couple of months before they started importing oil from Iran while the waivers lasted. Neither South Korea nor Japan expect any major negative impact from the cancelation of the waivers, officials from the two countries have said. However, now they will have to find an affordable alternative to Iranian oil, especially condensate, of which South Korea is a major importer.



One obvious alternative would be U.S. light crude, which is comparable in quality with Iranian condensate. South Korea is already the second-largest oil client of the U.S. as of the end of 2018, after Canada and ahead of China. The average daily intake of U.S. crude in South Korea last year was 236,000 bpd. This is actually lower than what South Korea imported from Iran during the waiver period, at 235,533 bpd for January to April this year, but now that the waivers have been removed, shipments of U.S. light will most likely increase.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:The IEA's Dire Warning For Energy MarketsTrump’s New Plan To Spark A California Oil BoomSaudi Tanker Attack Reveals Oil Market Weakness

The American Petroleum Institute (API) reported a large surprise build in crude oil inventory of 8.6 million barrels for the week ending May 10, coming in significantly over analyst expectations of a 2.125-million-barrel drawdown in inventories.Last week, the API reported a build in crude oil inventories of 2.81 million barrels. A day later, the EIA contradicted the API’s report, instead estimating a draw of 4-million-barrels.  Including this week’s data, the net build is now 29.52 million barrels for the 20-week reporting period so far this year, using API data.


Oil prices rose sharply on Tuesday on multiple reports of turmoil in the Middle East, including attacks on four oil tankers off the Strait of Hormuz, and a drone attack of a Saudi pipeline—although this was tempered somewhat by the escalating China-US trade war.WTI was trading up on Tuesday before the data release at $61.95, up $0.91 (+1.49%) on the day at 1:02pm, and up week on week. The Brent benchmark was also trading up on the day at $71.48, up $1.25 (+1.78%) at that time. The Brent benchmark was trading up roughly $2 week on week.The API this week reported a build in gasoline inventories for week ending May 10 in the amount of 567,000 barrels. Analysts estimated a draw in gasoline inventories of 274,000 barrels for the week.Distillates rose by 2.2 million barrels for the week, while inventories at Cushing rose by 2.1 million barrels.



US crude oil production as estimated by the Energy Information Administration showed that production for the week ending May 3—the latest information available—fell to 12.2 million bpd from the all-time high of 12.3 million bpd the week prior.The U.S. Energy Information Administration report on crude oil inventories is due to be released on Wednesday at 10:30a.m. EST.By 4:42pm EST, WTI was trading up at $61.67 and Brent was trading up at $71.19.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Oil Rises After Drone Attacks On Saudi InfrastructureThe Battle For Control Over Iraq’s OilThe Marijuana Industry’s Dirty Little Secret

 “The planet’s on fire,” were some of the milder words that Bill Nye The Science Guy used in HBO’s “Last Week Tonight With John Oliver”, to describe his thoughts on climate change, adding a few other choice words for the so-called climate deniers, telling them to “Wake the **** Up”—a far cry from his normal PBS kid-directed schtick that seeks to educate, rather than berate.Pulling no punches, Nye was speaking directly to members of Congress—at least those that are not on the climate change bandwagon that has become the cause de celebre for progressive democrats such as AOC through the Green New Deal and carbon pricing.Nye supported the AOC and the Green New Deal, selling the latter as a solution for global warming. Nye went a step further and chastised critics of the plan, who have pointed out the GND’s shortcomings when it comes to the plan’s ambiguous details, thin plan for executing it, and likely high costs.



Nye’s scathing words for those who oppose the plan didn’t stop there.Said Nye of the proposed solutions “…when something costs more, people buy less of it….” Shaming his audience further with the barb, “Nothing is free, you idiots.”Nye has long been an advocate for climate change measures, going toe to toe with Fox News’ Tucker Carlson on the legitimacy of the science behind climate change, and debating whether climate change is human-driven. However, Nye has irked those in the climate change camp by tagging along with climate denier Republic Rep. Jim Bridenstine to Trump’s State of the Union address—a move that some in the scientific community said inadvertently backed climate denial.

A group of US senators on both sides of the aisle is set to introduce a bill that will seek to sanction the Nord Stream II gas pipeline, according to Reuters citing an anonymous source close to the matter.The group of senators, which includes Republican Senator Ted Cruz, may submit the legislation today, and will target companies that are involved in the pipeline’s construction.Nord Stream II has been the subject of much debate in the United States, and the US has warned several companies involved in its construction that they could face sanctions.



Nord Stream is possibly the single most politically polarizing pipeline project of all time, and that’s saying a lot, what with all the controversy surrounding the Dakota Access Pipeline, Enbridge’s Line 5, and Trans Mountain. The issue with Nord Stream, however, is not one of climate concern, but of geopolitical concern, as it could position Russia to bypass the Ukrainian Gas Transmission System and, the United States argues, would make the EU scarily dependent on Russian gas.But Nord Stream II will offer cheap gas to Europe, and it’s hard to argue against cheaper gas.While the legislation may be introduced today, it is a far cry from done, as it will need to pass the House and the Senate, and then must go before the President for his rubber stamp.



The companies currently involved in financing the pipeline include Uniper, Wintershall, Shell, OMV, and Engie, according to Reuters.The United States has been eager to offer Europe its own LNG as an alternative to the Russian LNG that will be transported through Nord Stream II, and the EU has already promised to double its intake of US-supplied LNG over the next five years, reading 8 billion cubic meters in 2023.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Oil Shrugs Off Trade War ThreatThe Battle For Control Over Iraq’s OilOil Rises After Drone Attacks On Saudi Infrastructure

Italy’s oil and gas major Eni said on Tuesday that it had made a new discovery in Angola’s deep offshore estimated to contain up to 250 million barrels of light oil in place, with further upside.The results of the data collection from the new discovery in Block 15/06 indicates a production capacity of over 10,000 barrels of oil per day, Eni said, adding that the discovery, Ndungu, is the fourth commercially viable discovery since the Block 15/06 Joint Venture re-launched the exploration campaign in the middle of 2018.Ndungu is some 2 km (1.2 miles) away from the Mpungi field, so the latest discovery can be fast-tracked to production due to the proximity to the Sub Sea production system, according to Eni.  



The Ndungu discovery comes two months after Eni made a major oil discovery in Angola’s deepwater in a find that could help the African OPEC producer to reverse the recent decline in oil production. In March this year, Eni struck oil in Block 15/06 in the Agogo exploration prospect and estimates that the discovery contains 450-650 million barrels of light oil in place with further upside.   The data acquired from the well indicates a production capacity of more than 20,000 bpd, Eni said back then.Eni, a key player in Africa and in Angola, currently produces around 155,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in Angola.



The African country, however, has been struggling in recent years to offset a decline in production as many fields mature.After the oil price crash of 2014, Angola’s economy had suffered from the low oil prices and the country had also been struggling to attract international investments in its deepwater higher-breakeven oil resources.Last year, Angola introduced several new measures to try to boost its oil production and its attractiveness for international investment. President Joao Lourenco signed in the summer of 2018 a decree to create an agency that would sell and manage oil blocks instead of Sonangol. Earlier in 2018, Angola halved the tax rates on the development of oil discoveries with fewer than 300 million barrels of reserves.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Oil Shrugs Off Trade War ThreatGlobal Oil Flows At Stake In New Middle East Proxy WarThe Marijuana Industry’s Dirty Little Secret

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Russian President Vladimir Putin are meeting on Tuesday to discuss various issues, including the fate of Venezuela and Nicolas Maduro—a hot topic for the oil market as geopolitical tensions have mounted in recent weeks.  Secretary Pompeo will be meeting with Putin knowing that the Russian president is not committed to supporting Maduro at all costs and could be inclined to give up on the player on whom he is betting in Venezuela’s political chaos, the UK’s The Telegraph reports, quoting sources with knowledge of Putin’s attitude toward Maduro.Russia has been the staunchest supporter and ally of Maduro’s regime in the political power struggle in the Latin American country sitting on top of the world’s largest oil reserves, while the U.S. and many European nations have recognized Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó as the legitimate interim president.Russia has stood by Maduro for years and has poured billions of U.S. dollars in Venezuela in the form of loans and oil investments. Russia’s state-controlled oil giant Rosneft has extended US$6 billion of loans to Venezuela’s state oil firm PDVSA. As of December 31, 2018, Venezuela still owed Rosneft US$2.3 billion.



According to The Telegraph, Putin reportedly told U.S. President Donald Trump during their long phone call earlier this month that he wasn’t fond of Maduro and was ready to negotiate his departure.“Vladimir Putin detests Nicolas Maduro,” a Venezuelan source who has been dealing with Russia for decades told The Telegraph.Venezuela was one of the topics that the U.S. and Russian presidents discussed over the phone on May 3, President Trump said, adding, referring to Putin:“And he is not looking at all to get involved in Venezuela other than he’d like to see something positive happen for Venezuela.”Related: Bullish Fundamentals Intact Despite Trade War Worries 



Last week, a senior State Department official said, discussing Secretary Pompeo’s trip to Russia: “We are concerned about Russia’s actions in Venezuela, and we think support for Maduro is a losing bet. And so our support for the Venezuelan people continues, and that will be a subject for the discussion.”Russian analyst and journalist Vladimir Frolov wrote in The Moscow Times earlier this month that Putin “is ready to give up Venezuela for the right price” and that Putin could ask that “Withdrawing Russian military support for Maduro should also be matched by the withdrawal of U.S. military assistance to Ukraine.”By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Oil Rises After Drone Attacks On Saudi InfrastructureTight Oil Markets Could Be About To See A ‘Violent’ Price SpikeOil Opens Higher After Saudi Arabia Reports Attacks On Oil Tankers

European firms can still buy oil from Iran as some companies don’t have interests in the United States and aren’t concerned about the U.S. sanctions on Tehran, former Iranian foreign minister Kamal Kharrazi, who is now the head of Iran’s Strategic Council on Foreign Relations, told French daily Le Monde in an interview this week.The European companies that stopped importing Iranian oil after the U.S. re-imposed the sanctions in November seem to have decided to halt Iranian oil intake due to political reasons, according to an English translation of the Le Monde interview in Iranian outlet Mehr news agency.“Italy and Greece stopped their purchases, while the US had granted them some waivers. This shows that those countries have made a political decision,” Kharrazi said, as carried by Mehr.



European companies, however, are wary of secondary U.S. sanctions if they trade with Iran, especially in oil, as the U.S. is seeking to bring Iranian oil exports down to zero and ended all sanction waivers it had initially extended for six months.Last week, Iran said that it was suspending some of its commitments under the nuclear deal and threatened to resume enriching uranium to a higher level if the remaining signatories to the deal—the EU, Russia, and China—don’t fulfill within 60 days their commitments to Iran, including protecting Iranian oil trade from U.S. sanctions.The EU and the foreign ministers of the UK, France, and Germany, responded on the day after the Iranian ultimatum that “We reject any ultimatums and we will assess Iran’s compliance on the basis of Iran’s performance regarding its nuclear-related commitments under the JCPoA and the NPT (Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons).”



Yet, the ministers and the EU High Representative said in their statement that “We are determined to continue pursuing efforts to enable the continuation of legitimate trade with Iran, including through the operationalization of the special purpose vehicle ‘INSTEX’”—the special purpose payment vehicle that the EU set up earlier this year. By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Occidental Petroleum, Anadarko Seal The DealThe Shale Boom Is About To Go BustThere’s Tremendous Room For Growth In Offshore Oil & Gas

The Mexican government has approved a fiscal stimulus measure that could see Pemex raise oil production by as much as 400,000 bpd, S&P Global Platts reports, quoting the country’s Finance Minister, Carlos Urzua.The legislation concerns a credit agreement with a group of lenders including HSBC, JP Morgan, and Mizuho Securities. Under the new terms, the maturity of a loan of US$5.5 billion will be extended by two years and some US$2.5 billion in existing debt will be refinanced, the official said.The money will be used to boost oil production at ageing fields that are currently uneconomical to continue exploiting. To do this, the fields that the measure covers will be migrated from legacy assignment titles to production sharing agreements that were introduced by the previous Mexican government as part of a sweeping energy reform passed in 2014.



Mexico has been struggling to reverse a steady decline in its crude oil production resulting from insufficient investment and the consequent decline in much needed new discoveries. The previous government tried to solve the problem by removing Pemex’s monopoly position on the market and inviting foreign companies to explore for oil and gas on and offshore. The new government, however, has suspended all contracts signed by the previous administration and all new oil and gas auctions pending review.At the same time, however, the new administration is just as eager as their predecessors to increase production: President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised that by the end of his term in office, Mexico will produce almost 2.5 million bpd of crude – a level close to the 2013 average of 2.522 million bpd.The new government has also announced a lifeline for heavily indebted Pemex of US$3.6 billion, combining debt refinancing and tax cuts.



Pemex figures show the company’s crude oil production averaged 1.813 million bpd in 2018. To compare, production averaged 2.522 million bpd in 2013, falling to 1.948 million bpd in 2017.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Could This Emerging Oil State Become The Richest Nation In The World?Oil Rises After Drone Attacks On Saudi InfrastructureThe Battle For Control Over Iraq’s Oil

An early assessment by U.S. authorities has suggested Iran was behind the attack on tankers off the UAE coast at the port of Fujairah, which Saudi Arabia said had damaged two Saudi vessels, the Wall Street Journal reports, quoting a government official.Yesterday, Saudi reports about the attack, which Riyadh called a sabotage, pushed oil higher as even the slightest indication that tensions may be flaring up in the Middle East, doing its usual job of putting upward pressure on oil benchmarks.However, neither Saudi Arabia nor the UAE said who was or is most likely to have been behind the attack. The UAE also did not provide any details about the attack saying only that there were no casualties and the port of Fujairah was operating as usual.



Iran, for its part, condemned the attacks and called for an investigation into the event. Interestingly enough, it was Iranian—as well as Lebanese—media that first reported about attacks near Fujairah saying there had been explosions at the port, Ellen R. Wald noted in a report for Forbes yesterday. However, satellite images provided by TankerTrackers.com showed no evidence of explosions in the area.Things got more confusing after initially neither the UAE authorities nor the Saudis confirmed or denied the reports but later said there had been an act of sabotage without going into details. The UAE sources denied, however, there had been explosions—something easy enough to check.As usual, social media were quick to react with many blaming the most obvious culprit—Iran—as the “sabotage” came on the heels of U.S. warnings to commercial and military vessels in the Persian Gulf of possible action from Iranian forces. Still, it has yet to be established officially whether Iran would risk tipping the situation further into violence indeed.



The official who spoke to the Wall Street Journal made a point of saying the assessment was not final and declined to speculate about how the United States would respond if this early suggestion is confirmed in later assessments.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Tight Oil Markets Could Be About To See A ‘Violent’ Price SpikeOil Rises After Drone Attacks On Saudi InfrastructureNew Middle East Proxy War Could Jolt Oil Prices

A fourth tanker was a target of the sabotage that embroiled two Saudi and one Norwegian oil tankers, Reuters reported late on Monday, this time bearing the flag of the United Arab Emirates.Earlier in the day, the UAE had reported that three tankers had been the subject of sabotage off its coast, but did not offer any additional details as to the nature of the attacks. Saudi Arabia has also not commented on the nature of the attacks, but said that the damages were “significant”.



The Strait of Hormuz is a critical chokepoint for the oil trade, which Iran has threatened to close off should the US be successful at restricting its oil exports. Iran—enjoying a rather adversarial relationship with both Saudi Arabia and the UAE—chastised its fellow OPEC members for promising to ramp up production to ensure a well-supplied market as needed should Iran’s oil customers want it. Iran accused Saudi Arabia and the UAE of wielding their oil as a weapon.The third tanker the subject of sabotage was Norway’s. Norway said its tanker was struck with an unknown object, leaving a hole in the hull of its ship. The ship management company said the blow nearly caused the tanker to sink.



The sabotage, which has been revealed to now include four tankers, has increased tensions in the Middle East at a time when oil prices seem to be at the mercy of such geopolitical goings on, with quiet fingers being pointed at the likely suspect, Iran. Officials have stopped short of blaming Iran for the attacks in the absence of any evidence.US Central Command said it is helping to investigate the matter of sabotage at the UAE’s request.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:What Beijing’s Retaliation Means For OilTight Oil Markets Could Be About To See A ‘Violent’ Price SpikeOil Opens Higher After Saudi Arabia Reports Attacks On Oil Tankers

Mexico’s newest oil refinery project is set to exceed the planned budget—and in a big way—according to Moody’s cited by Reuters.The massive undertaking—by Mexico itself, no less—will most likely cost as much as between $2 billion and $4 billion more than it had originally planned, Moody’s said, citing its “limited know-how,” ironically exactly the situation Mexico sought to avoid when Mexico’s President, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador,  shunned Big Oil last week, cutting them out of the project all together for submitting bids that were over on time and over on budget.Mexico had originally sought out international help for the massive refinery that would bring Mexico closer to energy efficiency, garnering bids from Bechtel/Techint, Worley Parsons, and KBR. All three bids submitted pegged the costs somewhere between $10 billion and $12 billion, and the time to complete between four and six years.



Obrador thought the project should cost $8 billion and be completed in three years.Displeased with what this international help had to offer, Mexico decided to go it alone on this project—a decision that likely led Moody’s to prophecy large cost overruns anyway.“Given the government’s (and Pemex’s) lack of experience in building refineries, the project is likely to end up costing more and taking longer than the government anticipates, placing further strains on fiscal resources,” Moody’s said in a statement to Reuters.



Petroleos Mexicanos, or Pemex, is already the most indebted oil company in the world, and has been  hemorrhaging cash for years—even in the days of $100 oil.Earlier today, Mexico Daily News reported that three banks were extending an $8 billion loan to Pemex to add to its heavy debt burden, which is already more than $100 billion.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.com:New Middle East Proxy War Could Jolt Oil PricesCould This Emerging Oil State Become The Richest Nation In The World?The Oil Kingdom Enters A New Era

The Permian is set to increase not just oil and gas production in total, but new-well oil production per rig as well, more than offsetting the drop in legacy oil production in the region. The Permian basin now accounts for one third of the total crude oil output in the United States. And at the 4.173 million bpd the EIA is predicting for June, the Permian Basin, if it were a member of OPEC, would be the cartel’s No.3 producer, above the UAE (3.059 million bpd) and Kuwait (2.709 million bpd), and just slightly under OPEC’s No.2, Iraq (4.522 million bpd). Source: EIA Monthly Drilling Productivity Report By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:There’s Tremendous Room For Growth In Offshore Oil & GasEIA Crude Draw Arrests Oil Price CrashIran’s Master Plan To Beat U.S. Sanctions

Russia’s largest oil producer, Rosneft, reported on Monday a higher net income in the first quarter compared to both the fourth quarter of 2018 and Q1 2018, thanks to higher oil prices and the depreciation of the Russian ruble against the U.S. dollar.Rosneft’s net income in Q1 2019 in rubles jumped by 61.7 percent year on year, to US$2 billion (131 billion Russian rubles), mostly attributable to higher operating profit and a foreign exchange gain.Revenues jumped by 20.6 percent on the year in rubles, thanks to higher volumes of crude oil and petroleum products sales, which grew by 7.6 percent, and to the rise in crude oil prices in rubles, up 12.7 percent on the year, on the back of the Russian currency depreciation.



“Despite the volatility and quarterly decrease in oil prices, the decline in oil production under the OPEC+ Agreement and the Agreement on stabilization of prices for petroleum products on the domestic market, in Q1 2019 the Company demonstrated healthy financial performance in terms of both earnings growth and strong free cash flow generation,” Igor Sechin, Rosneft’s Chairman of the Management Board and CEO, said in a statement.Despite the OPEC+ agreement, Rosneft’s production rose in the first quarter of this year compared to Q1 2018, the company said in a separate press release. Rosneft’s Q1 2019 liquids production amounted to 4.74 million bpd, up by 3.9 percent from the first quarter of 2018, due to active development of greenfields and production ramp-up at several brownfields.Related: Is This The Most Underrated Upstream Player In The Industry?



Due to the compliance with Russia’s pledge in the OPEC+ production cut deal, however, Rosneft’s output declined by 1 percent in Q1 2019 compared to Q4 2018.Rosneft, which alongside other Russian companies is said to be reluctant to continue to cut production after June, said today that it could “promptly” raise production if restrictions are eased.  “The Company has substantial potential to promptly increase production on the back of flexible well stock and well operations management approaches. In case of external restrictions ease the Company is able to secure over 4.8 mmbbl of average daily liquids production in Russia by the year-end,” Rosneft said.

Just one Indian refiner has agreed to buy additional crude oil supply from Saudi Arabia to compensate for the loss of Iranian barrels, as India’s firms have been looking for months to diversify their crude sources and as the Kingdom raised its prices to Asia to take advantage of the supply crunch.Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals (MRPL) is the only Indian refiner out of four state-held companies that had bought Iranian oil under the sanction waivers to have taken up the Saudi offer for additional crude supplies, and will lift around 2 million barrels in June on top of its normal purchase of 2.5 million barrels, industry sources told Reuters on Monday.Under its exemption from the U.S. sanctions on Iran that ended at the beginning of May, India was allowed to buy some 300,000 bpd of Iranian oil.



Now that the waivers are over, just one of the four Indian refiners has requested more Saudi oil for June, according to Reuters’ sources. There are two key reasons for the lukewarm reception of the extra Saudi supply—high Saudi official selling prices (OSPs) for its Asian customers for June, and the greater diversification of the Indian refiners who are looking to other suppliers from the Middle East and to other countries, including Mexico, Brazil, and the United States.Related: Oil Opens Higher After Saudi Arabia Reports Attacks On Oil TankersIndia’s four state-held oil refiners who were Iranian customers until last month have been diversifying suppliers to offset possible tighter U.S. sanctions on Iranian oil, and all four were certain that they won’t have trouble replacing any loss of Iran’s oil with more supplies from the Arab Gulf OPEC members, from Mexico, and the United States, company officials told Reuters before the U.S. announced the end of all sanction waivers for Iranian customers.“In our system, UAE and Iraq oil turned out to be better than Saudi oil,” a source at an Indian refinery told Reuters today.



Earlier this month, American officials said that the United States was working with oil producers like Saudi Arabia and the UAE to ensure India has enough crude supply after the end of the sanction waivers, but the U.S. can’t ensure its own oil will be sold to India at preferential prices.

Russia’s crude oil production averaged 11.16 million bpd in the first twelve days of May, Reuters reported on Monday, citing two industry sources, which means that Moscow is finally within its cap under the OPEC+ deal, although the decline in production may have been the result of restricted exports via the Druzhba oil pipeline due to a contamination issue.As part of the OPEC+ production cuts between January and June, Russia is taking the lion’s share of the non-OPEC cuts and pledged to reduce production by 230,000 bpd from October’s post-Soviet record level of 11.421 million bpd, to 11.191 million bpd.Russia’s crude oil production stood at around 11.24 million bpd in the first half of April, meaning that the leader of the non-OPEC group part of the OPEC+ deal had yet to fall in line with the pledged production cuts.



For the full month of April, Russian crude oil production averaged 11.23 million bpd, down from 11.3 million bpd in March, but still above the quota that Russia had pledged under the deal with OPEC to curb oil supply.Moscow has repeatedly said that due to weather and geological conditions in the cold Russian winter, it cannot cut its oil production too quickly.Related: Could This Emerging Oil State Become The Richest Nation In The World?Last month, Russia halted supplies via the Druzhba oil pipeline to several European countries due to a contamination issue, which the Russians say was deliberate. Russian production has been curtailed because of the restricted exports via the Druzhba pipeline.  



Between May 1 and 12, the oil intake in the network of the oil pipeline company Transneft—which transports some 85 percent of all Russian crude oil—was 6 percent lower than the average in April, two sources with knowledge of the data told Reuters today, but did not elaborate whether the decline was the result of the contamination issue at the Druzhba pipeline.Over the weekend, Ukrainian oil pipeline transportation company Ukrtransnafta said that it had resumed oil transit to European clients via the Druzhba pipeline.According to Russia’s energy ministry, normal deliveries via the pipeline are expected to resume in the second half of May.  By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:The Shale Boom Is About To Go BustSignificant Supply Outages Put OPEC In A Very Difficult PositionThe European Gas Game Is About To Change

A bill at the Illinois legislature proposes to raise the annual registration fee for electric vehicles (EV) from US$17.50 to US$1,000 and to more than double the gas tax from 19 cents to 44 cents per gallon, under a plan to fund infrastructure advanced by Democrat State Senator Martin Sandoval.According to the bill, introduced at the Illinois General Assembly, owners of fully electric vehicles “shall register the vehicle for a fee of $1,000 for a one-year registration period,” under the proposal that strikes out the current “In no event may the registration fee for electric vehicles exceed $18 per registration year.”The bill also proposes to increase significantly the gas tax in the state, as well as the license fees.



The proponent of the bill, Martin Sandoval, argues that this is a plan to raise funding for much needed infrastructure improvements in the state, while EV owners and gasoline car owners alike are unhappy with the proposed legislation, for different reasons.“We haven’t updated our gas tax since 1990. We haven’t had a capital bill in over 10 years. It’s time to modernize our transportation funding formula to make it sustainable and consistent,” says Sandoval, adding that “Our transportation system has been underfunded for far too long. We’ve been kicking this can down the road for decades and it’s time for us to finally step up and find a solution.”According to Rivian, an EV developer which is considered to be a potential future rival to Tesla and which owns a factory in Illinois, the proposal for such high EV fees would discourage EV technology.Related: Oman’s Newest Approach To Boost Oil Production



“Imposing fees on EVs that are over 400 percent more than their gasoline powered counterparts is not only unfair, it discourages promising new technology that will reduce our dependence on petroleum, reduce emissions, and promote the Illinois economy,” Rivian spokesman Michael McHale said, as carried by Electrek.The Citizens Utility Board (CUB) said, commenting on the Illinois proposal to hike registration fees for EVs:“It’s punitive, it’s unfair and it goes against Illinois’ transportation trends and needs.” By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Occidental Petroleum, Anadarko Seal The DealNew Middle East Proxy War Could Jolt Oil PricesCould This Emerging Oil State Become The Richest Nation In The World?

A collision between an oil tanker and a tug boat in the Houston Ship Channel on Friday caused a capsizing and an oil derivative leak. The tug boat, according to reports, was moving two barges, one of which capsized as a result of the collision.The two vessels were carrying a combined 25,000 tons of reformate. This is a by-product of oil refining that is used in the production of gasoline. According to the most recent report from the Houston Chronicle, some 9,000 barrels of reformate was spilled in the waterway and cleanup is continuing. According to estimates made by port officials, the cleanup and the removal of the fuel from the barges’ tankers will take around two days.



So far, the oil spill response crews have deployed 3,800 feet of boom around the barges and another 12,000 feet of boom in surrounding areas to protect the ecosystem while the cleanup continues.The Houston Ship Channel was closed after the collision but was reopened on Sunday after an official from the Texas General Land Office's oil spill prevention program said the water was not dangerous for humans even though there had been several reports about dead animals in the vicinity.



The cause of the collision is yet to be established but whatever it is, the cost for Houston Port will be high. The port is one of the busiest in the United States and every hour it remains closed carries a hefty price tag.The Houston Chronicle reports the accident will be investigated by the National Transportation Safety Board and that it will be the fifth accident the NTSB will investigate in the Houston Ship Channel in five years. One of these, in 2014, resulted in a spill of 168,000 gallons of bunkering fuel and the other, a year later, led to a spill of 88,000 gallons of a gasoline additive. Both accidents followed tanker collisions.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Rystad: U.S. Shale Is Now The World’s Second Cheapest Source Of Oil SupplyThe European Gas Game Is About To ChangeThe Biggest Catalyst In Oil Markets Is Going Unnoticed

Juan Guaido, the leader of the Venezuelan opposition, has instructed his envoy to the United States Carlos Vecchio to start talks with the U.S. military for help in overthrowing the Nicolas Maduro government, the Associated Press reports, citing a statement by Guaido.In his statement, the self-declared interim president of Venezuela referred to the talks as “direct communications” on a possible military “coordination”, in the latest sign that his efforts and those of his compatriots are not having the desired effect despite weeks of protests and a takeover of the U.S. business of Venezuela’s PDVSA, Citgo.



At the end of April, Guaido declared what he called “the final phase” in the opposition’s battle against the incumbent government, saying some in the Venezuelan military had switched allegiances and now supported the opposition. He called on the rest to drop their loyalty to Maduro and join the opposition’s fight. However, the phrase “final phase” turned out to be a little exaggerated with a few soldiers joining in the protests and nothing definitive resulting from them.The opposition leader has said he considers that he has the right to invite foreign military forces to intervene in Venezuela in a way similar to how Simon Bolivar, the leader of the Venezuelan revolutionary movement, invited British mercenaries to oust the Spaniards from the country. What he may have neglected, however, is that there is a difference between ousting a foreign ruler and removing a local government despite the less than flattering track record of that same government using the military of a country that is unlikely to be a favorite with many Venezuelans suffering the consequences of U.S. sanctions.



In other words, the situation in the troubled country will likely continue to deteriorate, and as a direct result of this, Venezuela’s oil production will continue to suffer, supporting international prices. A direct U.S. military intervention--which, the AP notes, has not been seriously considered so far despite general statements to the tune of every option being on the table--would undoubtedly push prices even higher.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:New Middle East Proxy War Could Jolt Oil PricesOil Opens Higher After Saudi Arabia Reports Attacks On Oil TankersWill Russia Abandon The OPEC+ Oil Deal?

Tesla Model 3 returned to the list of the top ten best-selling passenger cars in the United States in April, taking the ninth spot, according to rankings by auto sales tracking site GoodCarBadCar.This is the first time that Model 3 has made it on the U.S. top 10 best-selling cars list since December last year.Back then, Tesla’s flagship affordable model ranked fifth in the total U.S. car sales standings with 25,250 Model 3s sold in the last month of 2018. For full 2018, Tesla Model 3 sales in the U.S. were 140,317 cars.



According to the GoodCarBadCar rankings and data for April 2019, Tesla Model 3 sales in April stood at 10,050 units, while year-to-date to April, Model 3 sold 32,475 vehicles in the United States, up by 169 percent compared to the same period of 2018.The Tesla Model 3 absence from the top 10 best-selling cars in the United States between January and March this year could be explained with the reduced tax credit in the U.S. and with the electric vehicle (EV) maker’s push to start delivering Model 3 on the international markets.Tesla started deliveries of Model 3 in Europe in the first quarter of 2019.



However, in Q1, Tesla had a challenging time with deliveries, with its total vehicle deliveries slumping by 31 percent from the previous quarter, ending well below analyst estimates. Tesla delivered around 63,000 vehicles in Q1, up by 110 percent compared to the first quarter of 2018, but 31 percent lower than the vehicles delivered in Q4 2018.Tesla Model 3 topped the global EV sales ranking compiled by CleanTechnica and EV Volumes for 2018. In fact, Tesla as a brand dominated the top 5, with all three of its models there.But the race to ramp up production of Tesla Model 3 last year depleted the EV maker’s cash and Tesla finally resorted to raising capital through offering common stock and convertible bonds in a move that analysts described as “net positive” and probably long overdue.  By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:EIA Crude Draw Arrests Oil Price CrashSTEO: Brent To Average $70 This YearOil Inches Higher As Rig Count Continues To Decline

Buckeye Partners, LP—one of the largest independent liquid petroleum products pipeline operators in the United States—said on Friday that asset manager IFM Global Infrastructure Fund would buy it in an all-cash deal valued at US$10.3 billion enterprise value and US$6.5 billion equity value.Buckeye Partners—a publicly traded master limited partnership—owns, operates, or has significant interests in approximately 6,000 miles of pipeline in the United States. Buckeye also has more than 100 delivery locations and 115 liquid petroleum products terminals with aggregate tank capacity of over 118 million barrels. Its network of marine terminals is located primarily in the East Coast and Gulf Coast regions of the United States, as well as in the Caribbean.Under the definitive agreement with IFM Investors, the IFM Global Infrastructure Fund will buy all outstanding units of Buckeye for US$41.50 per common unit.



Master limited partnerships (MLP) are a corporate structure that’s unique to the United States. With it, companies are not paying corporate taxes and are giving most of their profits to investors, the unit holders, much like dividends.Buckeye’s board of directors has already unanimously approved the proposed acquisition by IFM, while the closing of the deal is subject to approval from a majority of Buckeye’s unit holders, as well as regulatory approvals, and other customary closing conditions. The closing of the transaction is expected to take place in the fourth quarter of this year.“The proposed acquisition of Buckeye is a complementary addition to IFM’s substantial investments in energy infrastructure across North America and globally. We look forward to supporting the continuing growth of the business,” Jamie Cemm, Executive Director of IFM, said in a joint statement.



“Buckeye’s Board of Directors recently reviewed strategic options for the business and determined that IFM’s proposal to acquire Buckeye is in the best interest of Buckeye,” Buckeye’s chairman, president and CEO, Clark C. Smith, said.Following the news of the transaction, Buckeye’s units shot up more than 28 percent shortly after the market opened on Friday.

India’s Reliance Industries will shut for up to four weeks a 330,000-bpd crude oil processing unit at its 660,000-bpd Jamnagar refinery, beginning in the middle of June for planned maintenance, Reuters reported on Friday, citing two industry sources with knowledge of the company’s plans.The refinery predominantly supplies refined oil products to the domestic market.Back in January, Reliance Industries carried out maintenance at the other crude unit at the 660,000-bpd refinery and closed it for four weeks.



Reliance’s Jamnagar site is the world’s largest refining hub, in which the refinery in the Special Economic Zone (SEZ) is the sixth largest in the world with a capacity to process 580,000 bpd of crude oil, according to Reliance Industries’ website.The first refinery at the Jamnagar site was built in 1999 and has an installed capacity of 660,000 bpd, selling refined oil products on the domestic market.The refinery at the SEZ was added in 2008 and made the Jamnagar complex the world’s largest oil processing hub. Last year, Reliance increased the capacity of its export-oriented refinery by 30 percent to 704,000 bpd.



Last month, The Times of India reported that Saudi Arabia’s oil giant Aramco is in “serious discussions” to buy up to 25 percent of the refining and petrochemicals businesses of Reliance Industries.In recent years, Saudi Arabia has been pursuing downstream deals in Asia—the most prized market for oil exporting nations, aiming to lock in future demand for Saudi crude oil. India, for its part, is a fast-growing demand center and the world’s third-largest oil consumer after the U.S. and China.During the visit of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to India in February, Saudi Arabia announced plans to invest US$100 billion in India’s infrastructure and energy industry as it seeks to strengthen its position in the country.

China’s two largest oil companies, CNPC and Sinopec have not ordered any Iranian oil cargoes to load this month after the expiry of the sanction waivers Washington had granted China and seven other Iranian oil importers, Reuters reports, citing unnamed sources.The news comes despite statements from Beijing that it will not comply with the U.S. sanctions against Iran and will continue trading with the country including buying crude oil from it. China is the biggest buyer of Iranian crude, most recently at a rate of 475,000 bpd, over the first quarter of 2019. That amount is above the quota that the U.S. assigned to China as part of the waiver.



The Reuters sources said, however, that the refiners are worried about sanction violation penalties as both have enough exposure to the U.S. banking system to be vulnerable to such penalties. Even so, one of the sources said, Sinopec was unwilling to breach its long-term supply contract with Tehran. This probably means the company will look for ways to circumvent sanctions.Meanwhile, all of Iran’s oil clients are looking for alternatives, and they are finding them, but at a higher price: Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and the UAE were quick to assure the market they would step in and boost exports to fill the Iranian oil gap after the U.S. announced that no waivers would be renewed. Soon after, Saudi Arabia said it would hike prices for Asian clients for June delivery shipments in response to requests for additional deliveries. Higher prices are not something that would make either China or India happy, but their options are limited.



Despite Washington’s determination to completely stop the flow of oil from Iran to foreign markets, few believe that the zero-export target is achievable, even though the sanctions have done some considerable damage to Iran’s coffers. The U.S. special envoy for Iran Brian Hook last month estimated the losses suffered by Tehran in oil revenues at US$10 billion.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:The Shale Boom Is About To Go BustExxon Presents Its Very Own Solution To Climate ChangeSignificant Supply Outages Put OPEC In A Very Difficult Position

Ireland has declared a climate emergency, with Climate Action Minister Richard Bruton calling climate change the greatest challenge mankind is facing.ITV quoted the minister as saying, “We’re reaching a tipping point in respect of climate deterioration. Things will deteriorate very rapidly unless we move very swiftly and the window of opportunity to do that is fast closing.”The move, which followed cross-party support to amendments to a climate action report drafted by the country’s parliament, made Ireland the second country in the world to declare a climate emergency after the UK. In the latter, the declaration followed crippling environmentalist protests in London that paralyzed parts of the city.



In its wake, an independent, government-appointed Committee on Climate Change recommended to the government such measures as reducing the consumption of meat and dairy products, changing the way farms do business, and making electric cars the only cars that people can buy starting in 2035. By 2050, according to the panel, the country should be greenhouse gas emission-free.It looks like climate emergency declarations could become a trend: hours after media reported the Irish parliament’s vote for an emergency, the New Zealand Vegan Society issued a call for the government to declare a climate emergency.“New Zealand is woeful in it's protection of the environment, with many rivers and waterways polluted, in part due to excess dairying in particular regions. It shows that we are simply not doing enough to protect our part of the world,” the call read.Related: The European Gas Game Is About To Change



“It is the next biggest inconvenient truth... eating animals is causing habitat loss, driving climate change and the 6th mass extinction wave. What can we do? The answer is simple: go vegan and plant trees!” said a Vegan Society Aotearoa New Zealand representative, Claire Insley.It is likely that more activism will follow elsewhere, and if persistent enough it would lead to more climate emergency declarations. The question remains, however, whether declarations would spur enough effective-immediately legislation that could effect a comprehensive energy demand change in whole nations.Meanwhile, new renewable energy capacity additions have stalled, with growth in 2018 flat on the year, according to new figures from the International Energy Agency.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:The Shale Boom Is About To Go BustThe Race For An Oil Spill SolutionExxon Presents Its Very Own Solution To Climate Change

Oil prices picked up later in afternoon trading on Thursday after US President Donald Trump suggested that the United States may not raise tariffs on Chinese goods after all, according to Reuters.Trump announced on Thursday that he received a “beautiful” letter from China’s president that suggested that China and the United States “work together” to reach a deal over trade between the two nations.The trade war that has continued to linger in uncertainty looked over the weekend like it would result in an increase in tariffs yet this week, pushing oil prices down as higher tariffs would likely eat away at Chinese demand for crude oil.



On Monday, crude oil prices fell as President Trump lashed out over Twitter, saying that “the trade deal with China continues, but too slowly, as they attempt to renegotiate. No!” At the time, President Trump threatened to raise the current 10% tariff to 25% on $200 billion worth of goods that do not include high tech goods, which are already assessed at 25%.This uncertainty has created volatility and therefore opportunity in the oil trade, along with various other market stressors, such as sanctions on Venezuela and Iran, and production supply outages in Libya and most recently, oil export issues in Russia.Unless a deal is reached, the higher tariff will go into effect on Friday, which would likely see China respond with a retaliatory tariff of their own.  Further muddying the oil waters, China is giving every indication that it plans to continue to purchase Iranian oil despite the US sanctions, and is also continuing its relationship with sanctioned-Venezuela. 



At 4:02pm EST on Thursday, WTI crude was trading down $0.58 (-0.93%) at $61.54 on the day with Brent trading down $0.24 (-0.34%) at $70.13 on the day.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:There’s Tremendous Room For Growth In Offshore Oil & GasEIA Crude Draw Arrests Oil Price CrashSTEO: Brent To Average $70 This Year

With its legal oil export avenues cut off by the end of all U.S. sanction waivers for its crude oil buyers, Iran has recently resumed illicit shipping of oil to Syria, CNBC reported on Thursday, citing data from tanker tracking firms.TankerTrackers for example said today that “We spotted the first delivery of Iranian crude oil into Syria since January 1st of this year. A million barrels arrived on May 5th.”Both TankerTrackers and ClipperData have spotted a delivery of around 1 million barrels of crude oil from Iran into the Syrian port of Baniyas, home to Syria’s biggest refinery, in the first week of May. The tanker they had been tracking had at one point switched off its transponder—a tactic that analysts believe Iran will start using more often to ship and sell its oil ‘under the radar’.  



The maximum pressure campaign of the United States against Iran led the Trump Administration to end all sanction waivers for Iranian oil buyers in its attempt to drive Iranian oil exports to zero.Iran, for its part, is accusing the U.S. and its allies of using oil as a political tool and has repeatedly said that American sanctions can’t and won’t bring Iranian oil exports to zero.Analysts think that Iran’s largest oil buyer China may not completely stop its purchases of Iranian crude oil as Beijing has said that it wouldn’t comply with U.S. sanctions imposed on Iran. Experts also believe that Iran will be re-opening and using more of its illicit oil channels to keep oil trade and continue getting some revenues from its most precious export commodity.



On Wednesday, Iran said that it was suspending some of its commitments under the nuclear deal and threatened to resume enriching uranium to a higher level if the remaining signatories to the deal—the EU, Russia, and China—don’t fulfill within 60 days their commitments to Iran, including protecting Iranian oil trade from U.S. sanctions.The U.S. responded to the flare-up in tensions with Iran with Iran’s Special Envoy Brian Hook vowing that any attack against the United States or its allies would be met with a show of force.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Rystad: U.S. Shale Is Now The World’s Second Cheapest Source Of Oil SupplyThe European Gas Game Is About To ChangeThe Biggest Catalyst In Oil Markets Is Going Unnoticed

Shell plans to invest as much as US$2 billion annually in its Brazilian operations by 2025, Shell’s chief executive officer Ben van Beurden told Brazilian business daily Valor Economico in an exclusive interview published on Thursday.  Shell, one of the most active foreign players in the Brazilian oil and gas sector, may even increase that amount in order to seize acquisition opportunities in three oil and gas auctions in the Latin American country.Shell will not focus its operations and investments only in the oil sector, and will pursue opportunities in natural gas, biofuels, and solar energy, van Beurden told Valor Economico. The supermajor, however, will not be investing in refineries in Brazil, he noted.



Shell has been one of the most active foreign companies in many recent auctions that Brazil has held for its coveted offshore pre-salt layer. Back in 2017, a senior executive at Shell said that the company is confident that it can produce oil from Brazil’s promising prolific pre-salt layer for less than $40 per barrel.At an auction in September 2018, Shell, in a consortium with Chevron, won a 35-year production sharing contract for the Saturno pre-salt block located in the Santos Basin off the coast of Brazil. With the addition of the Saturno block, which Shell won in Brazil’s Fifth Pre-Salt Bid Round, the Anglo-Dutch major boosted its total net acreage offshore Brazil to around 2.7 million acres.“We are pleased to add another material, operated exploration position to our leading portfolio in one of the world’s most prolific deep-water areas” Andy Brown, Upstream Director, Royal Dutch Shell, said last September.



Shell is also a partner pf Brazil’s state oil firm Petrobras in many deepwater projects offshore Brazil. Shell is a strategic partner of Petrobras in the pre-salt layer, holding minority interests in the Libra and Lula fields and in other areas such as Sapinhoá, Lapa, and Iara, all of which are located in the Santos Basin.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Exxon Presents Its Very Own Solution To Climate ChangeRystad: U.S. Shale Is Now The World’s Second Cheapest Source Of Oil SupplyOil Slips Despite Bullish OPEC Report

Libya’s UN-backed internationally recognized government has suspended the Libyan operations of as many as 40 foreign companies, including those of France’s oil and gas supermajor Total, Reuters reported on Thursday, citing a government official.  According to the Tripoli-based government of national accord (GNA), the licenses of those 40 foreign firms had expired.Total has several exploration and production (E&P) operations in Libya, and just last year, the French major boosted its upstream Libyan operations by acquiring the 16.33-percent stake of the Waha oil concessions held by U.S. Marathon Oil Corporation for US$450 million in cash.



The acquisition gave Total access to reserves and resources of more than 500 million barrels of oil equivalent, with immediate production of around 50,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boed) and a significant exploration potential in the prolific Sirte Basin, the French company said at the time, noting that the acquisition was part of its strategy to reinforce its portfolio with high quality and low-technical cost assets.However, just over a year later, the security situation in Libya has worsened as eastern strongman General Khalifa Haftar ordered last month his Libyan National Army (LNA) to march on the capital Tripoli. The self-styled army has been clashing with troops of the UN-backed government in a renewed confrontation that could escalate and threaten to disrupt, once again, Libya’s oil production and exports.In this situation, the relations between the UN-backed Libyan government based in Tripoli and France have recently soured because France has ties to both the GNA and Haftar.



In the middle of April, the GNA said that it would suspend security cooperation with France, accusing the country of backing Haftar.Meanwhile, Mustafa Sanalla, the chairman of Libya’s internationally recognized National Oil Corporation (NOC), said at the Offshore Technology Conference (OTC) in Houston on Wednesday that “the Tripoli assault and ongoing hostilities are a direct threat to Libyan oil sector development and procurement.” By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Rystad: U.S. Shale Is Now The World’s Second Cheapest Source Of Oil SupplyIraq Close To Signing Mega $53 Billion Oil DealThe Biggest Catalyst In Oil Markets Is Going Unnoticed

A floating oil tanker that hasn’t been maintained since the conflict in Yemen erupted in 2015 is currently under the control of the Houthi rebels, who are preventing a United Nations team from assessing the danger from the tanker which has been described as “a floating bomb” that could explode after sitting unattended for so long.The Iran-aligned Houthi rebels have been fighting a Saudi-led Arab coalition in Yemen since 2015, and the Houthis have claimed over these years that they have targeted and hit oil facilities of Saudi Aramco in Saudi Arabia.The floating storage and offloading (FSO) unit SAFER has been sitting off Yemen’s coast since early 2015 and hasn’t been maintained or attended since then. Experts say that the oil in tanker now is at danger of exploding, potentially leading to an environmental disaster and further aggravating what is already the worst humanitarian crisis in the world.



The Houthis, however, are blocking access to the oil tanker, demanding a share of the revenues from the potential sale of some 1 million barrels of oil that the tanker still contains, The National reports.Last week, the leader of the Houthi uprising in Yemen, Mohammed Ali al-Houthi, asked the United Nations to sell the cargo of crude to generate revenues that would be used for the purchase of fuel and salaries for public sector employees.Various experts and organizations have been warning for months that the floating oil tanker is at danger of exploding.



Last month, the Atlantic Council said in a report that the “massive floating bomb in the Red Sea needs urgent attention” and that despite the several requests for UN assistance by Yemeni authorities, “the bomb remains afloat, untended and under the control of the Houthis.”“Given that the Houthis have already attempted to blow up several oil tankers in transit through the Bab al-Mandeb and Red Sea, it may well be the case that they view this precarious situation as a tactical and strategic advantage worth maintaining,” the authors Ian Ralby, David Soud, and Rohini Ralby wrote in April.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:There’s Tremendous Room For Growth In Offshore Oil & GasEIA Crude Draw Arrests Oil Price CrashSTEO: Brent To Average $70 This Year

Saudi Arabia has received several “moderate” requests to replace Iranian oil next month, Bloomberg reports, citing an anonymous source familiar with Riyadh’s oil plans.The report comes on the heels of news that OPEC’s de facto leader and largest producer has raised export prices for Asian customers for June and July due to additional requests for exports.According to a Reuters update, Saudi Arabia’s Arab Light for June delivery sells at a premium of US$2.10 per barrel to the Oman/Dubai average, up by US$0.70 per barrel from cargoes for May delivery. Riyadh also raised the price of this most popular among its grades for Europe, by US$0.80 a barrel from the price of shipments for May delivery. The price for oil exports to the United States, however, was reduced.



Interestingly enough, however, Saudi Arabia has no plans to start raising its oil production, the Bloomberg source noted. In March and April, the Kingdom pumped some 9.8 million bpd, below its quota of 10.311 million bpd assigned to it by the OPEC+ joint ministerial committee.Related: Oil Production Booms… But Funding Is Drying UpWhat’s more interesting, however, is that, according to the source, Saudi Arabia had no plans to increase its overall exports next month. This means it would have to cut shipments to some destinations to satisfy reported Asian demand. The total Saudi exports in June are seen at less than 7 million bpd, with more oil remaining at home to use for air conditioning, earlier media reports said.Earlier this month, reports emerged, again quoting unnamed sources close to Riyadh, that Saudi Arabia could actually increase its oil production in June. However, those sources said, speaking to Reuters, that this did not mean the country would increase exports.



“The Saudis want oil prices to stay at current levels at least for a month or two. They don’t want to raise their production above the 10.3 million bpd, because they are part of the OPEC+ pact, but they are also being pressured by the U.S. to increase their output,” one of the sources said at the time.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:EIA Crude Draw Arrests Oil Price CrashSTEO: Brent To Average $70 This YearIran’s Master Plan To Beat U.S. Sanctions

A report that Occidental Petroleum’s corporate jet traveled to the Hague, one of Shell’s two home towns, has sparked a fresh flare-up of speculation regarding its proposed acquisition of Anadarko, CNBC reports, citing an unnamed source.The news comes after reports on Thursday suggest that Chevron is bowing out of the fight to acquire Anadarko, despite some analysts thinking that it would up its offer to compete with Occidental’s. Chevron will be entitled to a $1 billion breakup fee per the terms of the original agreement.Bloomberg sources had originally reported today that Anadarko was looking for Chevron to increase its bid so that it was competitive with Occidental’s bid.



Occidental has been under the watchful eye of the media since its bid for Anadarko. Earlier this week, an earlier trip by Oxy’s corporate jet was reported by Bloomberg after sightings of Oxy’s Gulfstream V in Omaha, giving rise to rumors about a possible involvement of Warren Buffett in the deal, which later got their confirmation when Buffett said he was willing to bankroll the Anadarko acquisition if Occidental managed to get a final yes from the target company.The Sage from Omaha has committed US$10 billion to the deal, which is worth a total US$38 billion which has evidently been tracking the movements of the aircraft amid the bidding war between Oxy and Chevron, which last month offered to buy Anadarko for US$33 billion.Yet another Gulfstream V trip earlier this month, according to Bloomberg, had Occidental flying to Paris as well, where Total is headquartered.Related: Oil Production Booms… But Funding Is Drying Up



And now it looks like Shell is in the running as well, although in what capacity is not yet known.  Shell and Anadarko, CNBC recalls, have shared assets in the Permian, where Occidental is the top player and Anadarko is among the largest competitors. The acquisition of the latter would establish Occidental as an undisputed leader in a space that supermajors have been eager to tap as well, with all but one expanding their assets there and planning ambitious drilling campaigns.The lone exception is Total, which has no shale acreage at all in the United States, which would make the Oxy jet’s trip to Paris all the more intriguing if, of course, it was made with the intention of meeting with Total at all.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:The Biggest Catalyst In Oil Markets Is Going UnnoticedTurkey Steps Up Fight For Gas in Eastern MediterraneanIEA: Renewables Growth Is Stalling

The United States and Iran continued to trade barbs on Wednesday over the Iranian nuclear deal and Iranian oil exports as the United States stands firm on its position that it will succeed in reducing Iranian oil exports to zero, according to a US briefing reported by Asharq Al-Awsat.The US responded to flare ups in tensions with Iran with Iran’s Special Envoy Brian Hook vowing that any attack against the United States or its allies would be met with a show of force.Hook assured an unsettled market that it had already factored in Iran’s oil exports falling to zero. Oil prices were up in afternoon trading, with WTI up over 1 percent on the day.



The strong words from the United States came after Iran announced it would no longer be curbing its nuclear program, threatening to go even further, saying it would resume enriching uranium at a higher level if the EU fails to live up to its end of the agreement by continuing Iranian oil purchases.“In order to secure its rights and restore balance to the demands of the parties to the agreement, the Islamic Republic of Iran has no option other than ""reducing commitments"",” Rouhani said in a statement.The EU is finding itself between the proverbial rock and hard place as it struggles to not run afoul of US sanctions against a major oil supplier. Reaffirming its commitment to the sanctions, the United States said it would quickly respond to any sanctions violation by the EU.



US Special Assist to the President and Senior Director for Weapons of Mass Destruction added on Wednesday that Iran should expect more sanctions “very soon”.The United States had announced on Tuesday that it was deploying the USS Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group and a bomber task force to the U.S. Central Command region “to send a clear and unmistakable message to the Iranian regime.”  By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Should Chevron Walk Away From The Anadarko Deal?Iraq Close To Signing Mega $53 Billion Oil DealBP Bets Big On Gulf Of Mexico While Rivals Chase Shale

On a day where the United States has already went a few rounds with Iran over oil exports and sanctions, Florida Senator Rick Scott is calling for a US Naval blockade to stop Venezuelan oil from getting to its closest ally, Cuba, according to the Miami Herald.The US Navy should, according to Scott, employ a naval blockade stop the oil flow from Venezuela in an effort to choke off the influx of money to the country’s contested leader, Nicolas Maduro, to end his “brutal regime.”“It’s clear that the United States needs to consider using naval assets to block the flow of oil between the two dictatorships,” Scott said on Wednesday, who added that President Donald Trump had already “floated the idea” of a full embargo on Cuba.



Venezuela’s oil flows to Cuba have so far continued largely unabated despite the sanctions, with Venezuela desperate to make good on its oil for goods agreement that dates back to the Chavez/Castro administrations.Venezuela is Cuba’s largest oil supplier, and at a high point, the oil trade from Venezuela to Cuba reached 100,000 bpd. Maduro’s opponent, Juan Guaido, has long asserted that oil shipments to Cuba must stop as Venezuela is in crisis with repeated blackouts that have plunged the country into darkness.Guaido said in March that Venezuela was still shipping 47,000 barrels per day to Cuba, despite the current sanctions levied by the United States.



While Cuba has upped its oil purchases from Russia and Algeria, it is unlikely to find a better deal that it has from Venezuela—which is essentially free. The favorable arrangement with Venezuela is likely to fuel a desperation to keep that agreement alive and may prove a difficult habit for the United States to break.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:There’s Tremendous Room For Growth In Offshore Oil & GasEIA Crude Draw Arrests Oil Price CrashSTEO: Brent To Average $70 This Year

China imported around 800,000 bpd of crude from Iran in April—the highest amount that Iran’s top oil customer purchased since August last year—as Chinese refiners rushed to buy Iranian oil ahead of the expiry of the U.S. sanction waiver at the beginning of May, Reuters reported on Wednesday, citing ship tracking data from Refinitiv.The United States ended the sanction waivers for all Iranian customers in a move that caught the oil market off guard as analysts were widely expecting that the Trump Administration would extend at least some of the waivers in order to keep oil and gasoline prices in check. Iran’s oil customers were only guessing if the United States would extend the waivers that expired last week, so all Iranian clients, including its biggest customer China, rushed in to procure cheap Iranian oil in March and April.In March, the biggest oil importers in Asia—China, India, Japan, and South Korea—collectively bought 1.57 million bpd of oil from Iran, a 36-percent surge over February. China alone imported 541,134 bpd of Iranian oil, according to government data and trade sources compiled by Reuters.In April, China stepped up its purchases of Iranian oil from March and saw its imports from Iran at an eight-month high. The surge in Iranian imports resulted in China setting a new monthly oil import record, despite the fact that there was refinery maintenance and fuel demand was lukewarm, analysts tell Reuters.Total Chinese crude oil imports rose by 11 percent year on year in April 2019, to reach 10.64 million bpd, according to data from the Chinese General Administration of Customs, calculated by Reuters.State-run refineries bought a lot of Iranian crude oil to stockpile ahead of the sanction waivers expiry, and this was the key reason for the record Chinese imports last month, Wang Zhao, head of crude oil research at Sublime China Information, told Reuters.    By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:19 Historical Oil Disruptions, And How No.20 Will Shock MarketsIraq's Return To Oil's Top TablePipeline Bottlenecks Cost Canadian Producers $20 Billion

Saudi Aramco, which has an ambitious plan to grow its natural gas business, is considering investing in the Marcellus shale gas assets of Norway’s Equinor in what would be the first-ever foray of Saudi Arabia’s oil giant into the natural gas business outside the Kingdom, Bloomberg reported on Wednesday, quoting people familiar with the plans.Aramco is mulling over investing in Equinor’s Marcellus position either via a joint venture or by acquiring a stake in the operations, according to Bloomberg’s sources, who noted that talks between Aramco and Equinor are still at an initial stage.The Saudi state oil company may also team up with other oil firms to get U.S. shale gas acreage, the sources told Bloomberg.Equinor, for its part, operates assets in the Marcellus, in the Eagle Ford, and in the Bakken in the U.S.



The Norweian firm wants to add more acreage to its Appalachian gas assets, head of strategy Al Cook told Bloomberg earlier this year, while Equinor is also said to be considering selling some or all its operations in the Eagle Ford.Aramco is in talks with many partners for a potential joint venture or partnership in order to grow its international gas position, chief executive Amin Nasser said last month.Related: STEO: Brent To Average $70 This YearIn January this year, Nasser told Reuters in an interview that the oil firm was looking to spend billions of U.S. dollars on natural gas acquisitions in the United States as part of Aramco’s strategy to bolster its gas business and become a global natural gas player.At the end of February, Nasser said that Saudi Arabia aims to export as much as 3 billion cubic feet of gas per day by 2030 as part of its goal to boost the international footprint of its natural gas business.



In November 2018, Nasser said that Aramco, already a top global oil producer but not as strong in gas production, will boost efforts to grow its natural gas output, from both conventional and unconventional reserves.Saudi Aramco’s gas development program is expected to attract as much as US$150 billion in investments over the next decade, Nasser said.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:The Saudi Plan To Boost Spare Oil Production CapacityThere’s Tremendous Room For Growth In Offshore Oil & GasTrump’s Dangerous Oil Price Game

Exactly a year after the United States withdrew from Iran nuclear deal, the Islamic Republic said on Wednesday that it is suspending some of its commitments under the agreement and threatened to resume enriching uranium to a higher level if the remaining signatories to the deal—the EU, Russia, and China—don’t fulfill within 60 days their commitments to Iran, including protecting Iranian oil trade from U.S. sanctions.Earlier this week, Iran hinted that it could announce as early as on Wednesday reduced compliance under the nuclear deal in “counteractions” against the maximum pressure campaign of the United States, which ended all waivers for Iranian oil customers and sent a carrier strike group to the Middle East as a warning to Iran.“Starting today, Iran does not keep its enriched uranium and produced heavy water limited. The EU/E3+2 will face Iran's further actions if they can not fulfill their obligations within the next 60 days and secure Iran's interests. Win-Win conditions will be accepted,” Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said on Twitter on Wednesday.



Under the terms of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), as the Iran nuclear deal from 2015 is officially known, Iran was selling the excess enriched uranium, thus keeping its stocks below certain caps. As of today, Iran will stop selling enriched uranium, Rouhani said.Related: There’s Tremendous Room For Growth In Offshore Oil & Gas“In order to secure its rights and restore balance to the demands of the parties to the agreement, the Islamic Republic of Iran has no option other than ""reducing commitments"",” Rouhani said in a statement.“The remaining countries will be given sixty days to fulfil their obligations, especially in banking and oil fields. If they fail to meet Iran's demands in the time given, then the Islamic Republic of Iran will suspend compliance with the uranium enrichment limits and measures to modernise the Arak Heavy Water Reactor,” the Iranian president said.



“We will begin our two next steps regarding the level of enrichment and Arak Heavy Water Reactor if we don’t get the desired results,” Rouhani said, noting that the immediate actions announced today don’t violate the deal.

The U.S. State Department will complete an environmental impact review for the now notorious US$8-billion Keystone XL oil pipeline even if a federal appeals court dismisses the November 2018 ruling of a Montana judge that effectively blocked work on the project, CBC reports, quoting government attorneys.Washington filed an appeal against the November ruling last month in an attempt to get at least some work done on the pipeline that will carry some 830,000 bpd from Alberta through Montana, South Dakota, and Nebraska, where it would connect to the existing pipeline network that goes on to the Gulf Coast. The ruling required the State Department to once again review the project’s environmental impact documentation, which opponents of Keystone XL considered a victory.



In the appeal, however, the government attorneys argued that a second review of the environmental impact documentation of the project was meaningless because President Trump had issued TransCanada—now TC Energy—a new permit earlier this year, several months after the Montana district court ruling. The new permit sought to go around the obstacles that made the basis for the lawsuit against the project, basically boiling down to an incomplete assessment of the potential environmental damages a spill could lead to.Outside the environmental concern space, opponents’ main argument is that U.S. refiners do not need this much pipeline capacity in the long term, despite a shortage of pipeline capacity in Alberta right now that is forcing producers to ship their oil south by rail.



Meanwhile, the Canadian authorities in January approved some preparatory work on the project, such as clearing trees and foliage around parts of the route of the pipeline but this is nowhere near what TC Energy and the U.S. government, not to mention Albertan oil producers, want to see. Sadly for them all, TC Energy would not be able to begin construction works on Keystone XL this year as a result of the legal challenges, the company said in its latest earnings call earlier this week.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:19 Historical Oil Disruptions, And How No.20 Will Shock MarketsIraq's Return To Oil's Top TablePipeline Bottlenecks Cost Canadian Producers $20 Billion

Arab residents of the oil-rich Deir Ezzor area in Syria have been protesting for weeks against the U.S.-backed Kurdish forces that control the region east of the Euphrates river, with protests becoming violent in recent days and angry protesters disrupting convoys of truckloads of oil from the nearby fields.   The protests, which started at the end of April, call for the end of the Kurdish rule in the area—which the Arabs say is an “occupation”—and the Kurdish forces and militias to stop selling the oil from the area and stop robbing the Arab population of its oil.The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), backed by the United States expelled Islamic State from the Deir Ezzor area at the end of 2017, and have been in control of the oil-rich province since then.



The Arab residents in the area, however, want the Kurdish forces to stop selling the oil pumped from Deir Ezzor to the Syrian government, among other things. Arabs in eastern Syria also want end of discrimination in leadership positions and the end of compulsory conscription of young men from the area.According to tribal leaders and residents who spoke to Reuters, the Arab resentment toward the Kurdish forces has grown in recent weeks.Risks of a more violent confrontation are growing and SDF’s response to the Arab demands could determine if the situation will escalate, analysts tell Reuters.Related: Saudi Arabia Hikes Oil Prices For Asian Buyers As Supply Crunch Hits



In August 2018, the second-largest oil field in Syria, the Tanak field in the Deir Ezzor region, resumed operations nearly a year after U.S.-backed predominantly Kurdish forces recaptured the field from ISIS.The Tanak field, which hosts around 150 wells and the capacity to produce up to 40,000 bpd, was captured from the Islamist militants by the SDF in November of 2017, following fierce clashes with ISIS on the eastern bank of the Euphrates river.Less than a month before recapturing the Tanak oil field, SDF had wrested control over the al-Omar oil field in eastern Syria from the Islamic State. Al-Omar is Syria’s largest oil field, producing around 30,000 bpd before the civil war. After 2011, however, Al-Omar had fallen into the hands of Islamic State, which was at one point making US$5.1 million in monthly oil sale revenues on the black market.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Trump’s Dangerous Oil Price GameChina Set To Defy U.S. Sanctions On IranThe Saudi Plan To Boost Spare Oil Production Capacity

In what has now become a daily update on the bidding war for what would be the oil industry’s largest deal of the past few years, Anadarko Petroleum said that it believes that the latest sweetened offer from Occidental is a “superior proposal” than the merger deal it signed with Chevron in early April.Over the weekend, Occidental sent a revised proposal to Anadarko, sweetening the proposed deal by lifting the cash component of the purchase price to $59.00 per share plus 0.2934 shares of Occidental common stock per share of Anadarko common stock. This means that Occidental is offering to pay 80 percent of the US$38 billion it is offering in cash.Chevron’s proposal is for $16.25 in cash and 0.3869 of a share of Chevron common stock per share of Anadarko’s stock.Early last week, Anadarko said that it plans to resume negotiations with Occidental after Occidental announced on April 24 a proposal to buy Anadarko at a higher price than Anadarko had agreed in a deal with Chevron announced earlier in April.



Occidental has also won the backing of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, which has committed to invest US$10 billion in equity in Occidental if Oxy completes its proposed acquisition of Anadarko.The much higher cash offer in Occidental’s latest proposal has had Anadarko’s board reconsidering its choice of preferred buyer.Anadarko said that it had notified Chevron that Anadarko’s board of directors unanimously determined that Oxy’s latest proposal is “superior” and that it plans to terminate the merger agreement with Chevron.Related: Trump’s Dangerous Oil Price GameUnder the merger deal that Chevron and Anadarko signed before Occidental waded into the bidding war, Chevron has the right to “propose revisions to the terms of the Chevron Merger Agreement, or to make another proposal,” during the period to May 10, which may be extended in accordance with the Chevron Merger Agreement, Anadarko said.



If Anadarko terminates the deal with Chevron, it will have to pay Chevron a US$1-billion termination fee, as per the agreement.  According to analysts briefed by Bloomberg, Chevron is likely to make a new offer, but it could be forced to at least match Oxy’s offer if it wants to have Anadarko’s strong asset position in the Permian.  By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Electric Fracking Could Take Over The PermianOPEC Is Facing An Existential CrisisPipeline Bottlenecks Cost Canadian Producers $20 Billion

Iran is hinting that it could announce as early as on Wednesday reduced compliance under the so-called Iran nuclear deal in “counteractions” against the maximum pressure campaign of the United States, which ended all waivers for Iranian oil customers and sent a carrier strike group to the Middle East as a warning to Iran.On Sunday, U.S. National Security Advisor Ambassador John Bolton said that “In response to a number of troubling and escalatory indications and warnings, the United States is deploying the USS Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group and a bomber task force to the U.S. Central Command region to send a clear and unmistakable message to the Iranian regime that any attack on United States interests or on those of our allies will be met with unrelenting force.”



“The United States is not seeking war with the Iranian regime, but we are fully prepared to respond to any attack, whether by proxy, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, or regular Iranian forces,” Bolton said in a statement, days after the U.S. sanction waivers for all Iranian oil buyers expired.On Monday, Iranian Students’ News Agency (ISNA) reported that Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani may announce on Wednesday “counteractions against US’ withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).”



“Partial and total reduction of some of Iran’s commitments and resumption of some nuclear activities which were ceased following JCPOA are the first step by Iran responding to US’ withdrawal from the nuclear deal and the lack commitment from European countries to meet their vows,” ISNA reported.Meanwhile, the EU and the three EU countries part of the JCPOA deal—France, Germany, and the UK—said over the weekend that they “take note with regret and concern of the decision by the United States not to extend waivers with regards to trade in oil with Iran.” The EU vowed to work on keeping legitimate trade with Iran, together with third countries interested in supporting the JCPOA, including through the special purpose payment vehicle ""INSTEX"", which the EU set up earlier this year to keep trade payments—including oil trade—with Iran open.

Canada’s federal government is likely to announce in mid-June that it would be proceeding with the controversial expansion of the Trans Mountain oil pipeline designed to double the pipeline flow out of Alberta to the west coast in British Columbia, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday, citing officials familiar with the issue.Justin Trudeau’s federal cabinet will meet to discuss the Trans Mountain expansion on June 18 and is expected to take the decision on that day, officials tell Bloomberg, noting that “it’s possible but unlikely” that the government extends again the decision deadline in order to allow more time for consultations with stakeholders.While Alberta and its leaders have been advocating for the pipeline expansion, British Columbia has been strongly opposing the project, which is now owned by the federal government of Canada. The fierce opposition in British Columbia has forced Kinder Morgan to reconsider its commitment to expand the Trans Mountain pipeline, and to sell the project to the Canadian government in August 2018.



Days later, the Federal Court of Appeal quashed the federal government’s approval of the Trans Mountain expansion project, saying that the National Energy Board’s (NEB) review of the project was fraught with flaws that made it unsuitable as a basis for the government’s approval. The court ruled that the NEB failed to adequately consider how increased tanker traffic off British Columbia’s coasts would affect the environment and First Nations people in the region.Currently, the federal government is conducting consultations with First Nations regarding the project, in an attempt to address all possible concerns that opponents may have. Should the outcome of the consultations be positive, work on the project could start fairly quickly, the business entity in charge of the expansion said last month.  Newly sworn-in Alberta Premier Jason Kenney expects the Canadian government to proceed with the project and told BNN Bloomberg in an interview last week:

Saudi Arabia is raising its crude oil production to meet market demand after the U.S. sanction waivers for all Iranian customers ended last week, according to the U.S. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry.  “Our partners, if you will, our allies, Saudi Arabia for instance, they are increasing their production to meet these needs relative to the Iran sanctions,” Secretary Perry told CNBC in an interview on Tuesday.“Clearly, the smart message for all our friends and allies around the world is ‘don’t do business with these people’,” Secretary Perry said, referring to the U.S. sanctions on Iran and the U.S. expectations of how American allies should view Iran and doing business with Tehran right now.



Secretary Perry is the latest top official within the U.S. Administration to voice confidence that Saudi Arabia will be stepping in to fill in the gap in oil supply that Iran is expected to leave as of this month.While analysts are trying to assess how low Iran’s exports could drop, the Saudis are publicly saying that they would not be rushing to ramp up production before seeing actual barrels off the market.Saudi Arabia issued a measured response to the end of the U.S. waivers, vowing to work toward “market stability”, but stopping short of announcing any immediate production increase, as it did last year when it boosted oil production ahead of the U.S. sanctions waivers decision, only to see exemptions for eight Iranian buyers, an oversupplied market, and crashing oil prices.



“In the next few weeks, the Kingdom will be consulting closely with other producing countries and key oil consuming nations to ensure a well-balanced and stable oil market, for the benefits of producers and consumers as well as the stability of the world economy,” Saudi Energy Minister Khalid Al-Falih said in a statement on the day in which the U.S. announced the end of all waivers.Last week, reports emerged that the Saudis might pump more oil in June but this does not necessarily mean they would raise crude exports because the increased production would likely go for power generation as the summer begins in the Kingdom.  By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:There’s Tremendous Room For Growth In Offshore Oil & GasTrump’s Dangerous Oil Price GameChina Set To Defy U.S. Sanctions On Iran

A U.S. court has granted a stay of 120 days in a legal case that a hedge fund brought against Venezuela’s state-owned oil company PDVSA for unpaid debt amount to US$182 million. The court, according to Reuters, cited the “political situation” in Venezuela as reason for the stay.The stay was granted on two separate lawsuits brought by Red Tree Investments against PDVSA for its alleged default on four separate loans.



The political situation the court referred to is becoming increasingly complicated with two governments and two PDVSA boards, the first loyal to Maduro and the second appointed by self-declared interim president Juan Guaido, whom the United States wholly supports in his attempt to overthrow the Maduro government.“I expect that this precedent in the NY courts will help to grant a stay in other claims,” a Guaido official, special prosecutor Jose Ignacio Hernandez, told Reuters. Guaido appointed Hernandez a representative of Venezuela abroad.



The other claims Hernandez mentioned in his comment likely mean the ConocoPhillips court-awarded compensation of US$8.7 billion for the forced nationalization of its Venezuelan operations by the Hugo Chavez government and Crystallex’s US$1.2-billion compensation, also awarded by a court. Guaido is contesting both awards, seeking to revoke them.Crystallex, which is no longer in business, has been seeking to seize PDVSA’s U.S. assets—refiner Citgo—as compensation for the nationalization of one gold mine in Venezuela. This has proved hard to achieve, but the Canadian mining company did manage to get the US$1.2 billion court award. Its future attempt to seize a majority stake in Citgo may be doomed: Citgo is under the control of a board affiliated to Guaido and supported by the U.S. government and U.S. courts tend to follow the government’s lead in such politically sensitive cases, as the latest court decision on hedge fund Red Tree Investments suggests.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Electric Fracking Could Take Over The PermianOPEC Is Facing An Existential CrisisPipeline Bottlenecks Cost Canadian Producers $20 Billion

The U.S. Department of Energy announced on Tuesday a multi-million contract to Cray Inc and AMD, who will build the world’s fastest supercomputer that will be delivered to Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) in 2021. The Frontier supercomputer is expected to make its debut in 2021 and to be the fastest supercomputer in the world with a performance of more than 1.5 exaflops, making it capable of solving calculations up to 50 times faster than today’s most powerful supercomputers, ORNL said in a statement.The DOE contract is valued at more than US$600 million for the system and technology development of the supercomputer, aimed at boosting innovation and keeping the U.S. leadership in artificial intelligence (AI) and high-performance computing (HPC).                       



“Frontier’s record-breaking performance will ensure our country’s ability to lead the world in science that improves the lives and economic prosperity of all Americans and the entire world,” said U.S. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry. “Frontier will accelerate innovation in AI by giving American researchers world-class data and computing resources to ensure the next great inventions are made in the United States,” Secretary Perry added.  “Today’s announcement represents the power of collaboration between private industry and public research institutions to deliver groundbreaking innovations that scientists can use to solve some of the world’s biggest problems,” said Lisa Su, president and CEO at AMD.“Researchers at ORNL will use the Frontier system’s unprecedented computing power and next generation AI techniques to simulate, model and advance understanding of the interactions underlying the science of weather, sub-atomic structures, genomics, physics, and other important scientific fields,” said AMD, which will provide the high-performance AMD EPYC CPU and AMD Radeon Instinct GPU technology.



The system of the supercomputer will be based on Cray’s new Shasta architecture and Slingshot interconnect.“The combination of Cray and AMD technology in the Frontier system will dramatically enhance performance at scale for AI, analytics, and simulation, enabling DOE to further push the boundaries of scientific discovery,” Steve Scott, senior vice president and CTO at Cray, said.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads from Oilprice.com:The Saudi Plan To Boost Spare Oil Production CapacityGlobal Markets In Tailspin After Trump Reignites Trade WarTrump’s Dangerous Oil Price Game

The rate of addition new renewable energy capacity globally last year disappointed by failing to register any increase on 2017, the International Energy Agency reported, adding that the finding was unexpected after almost two decades of strong and steady growth.Last year new renewable capacity additions–including solar, wind, biomass, and hydropower—totaled 180 GW, the same as a year earlier. But what’s more worrying than the lack of annual growth is the fact this amount of new capacity only represents 60 percent of the necessary renewables capacity that the world has to add in order to meet long-term climate change goals, the IEA said.



Among the different types of renewable energy, solar was by far the leader, with total additions at 97 GW last year, unchanged on 2017. Wind power capacity additions, however, inched up to 50 GW last year, from 48 GW in 2017. New hydropower capacity additions, however, declined to 20 GW in 2018, from 25 GW in 2017.If the Paris Agreement 2050 climate goals are to be met, however, total renewable capacity in the world needs to expand by 300 GW annually until 2030. That’s under the IEA’s Sustainable Development Scenario, which seems increasingly unlikely to play out especially after last year carbon emissions from the energy industry increased by 1.7 percent to a record high of 33 gigatons. That was despite a 7-percent increase in power generation from renewable sources. To add insult to injury, emissions from the power generation sector also rose to record highs last year.



“The world cannot afford to press “pause” on the expansion of renewables and governments need to act quickly to correct this situation and enable a faster flow of new projects,” the IEA’s head, Fatih Birol said, commenting on the findings. “Thanks to rapidly declining costs, the competitiveness of renewables is no longer heavily tied to financial incentives. What they mainly need are stable policies supported by a long-term vision but also a focus on integrating renewables into power systems in a cost-effective and optimal way.”By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:There’s Tremendous Room For Growth In Offshore Oil & GasTrump’s Dangerous Oil Price GameChina Set To Defy U.S. Sanctions On Iran

An oil pipeline in the Iranian province of Khuzestan, exploded yesterday, TankerTrackers.com reported citing Iran’s state news agency IRNA and disclosing satellite images of the blast. According to the governor of the province, there were no casualties, IRNA reported. Still, a nearby village has been evacuated.Later reports from the Associated Press said the fire had also affected a gas pipeline, with five people injured.The cause of the blast was accidental, according to media reports. The 42-inch pipeline was being repaired and what caused the fire was a bulldozer crashing into the pipeline and an oil spill that caught fire. The valves to linked oil and gas pipelines have been shut off to prevent the fire from spreading, but the oil in the Omidieh pipeline needs to burn in full before repairs can be restarted.



This is the second serious pipeline blast in Khuzestan, Iran’s main oil-producing province, in the last two months. In March, a gas pipeline there exploded, killing four and wounding at least five people. The blast was caused by a gas leakage, according to local government officials. However, a deeper cause of such accidents, some believe, is the combination of inadequate safety measures and aging pipeline infrastructure.Related: Middle East Oil Giants Are About To Upend Oil TradingWhile these factors cause accidental pipeline blasts, sabotage is not unheard of, either, in Khuzestan, which is home to most of Iran’s Arab minority. Separatism is a long-running theme in the area and protests are not infrequent either.The most recent ones, however, had nothing to do with Arabs versus Persians. They were sparked by massive floods that devastated Khuzestan, with the locals blaming the government for its poor handling of the situation. Some even accused the government of deliberately diverting floodwater away from oil facilities instead of cities. Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh denied the accusations.



The floods also caused Iran to reduce production at the fields in the affected parts of Khuzestan, although the reduction was not particularly significant, at 20,000 bpd. The floods killed more than 70 people and costs Iran US$2.5 billion in damaged infrastructure, homes, and farmland.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Trump’s Dangerous Oil Price GameChina Set To Defy U.S. Sanctions On IranEU Promises To Double U.S. LNG Imports Within 5 Years

US refineries have upped their imports of Iraqi, Nigerian, Brazilian, and Angolan crude oil, with May volumes double that of April levels, data from Refinitiv Eikon showed on Monday.Oil imports from these countries to the United States spiked as oil supply from Iran and Venezuela dried up, and as reduced OPEC production made scarce heavy sour and even medium sour grades.  Of note, Iraqi oil rose to 600,000 barrels per day in May, just in time for summer driving season to come, Refnitiv data showed.In February 2019, the latest official data available by the US Energy Information Administration, pegged Iraqi oil imports to the United States at 11.828 million, or about 422,000 bpd. Venezuela’s imports to the US had already fallen significantly by February, at 6.7 million barrels for the month, or 239,000 bpd.



Nigeria and Angola, too, are increasing their shipments to the US in May as well, at a combined 420,000 bpd, according to Refinitiv data, up from 19,000 bpd in February and up from 182,600 bpd in January.Venezuela’s oil production shortcomings have changed the face of US oil imports, causing refineries that had previously relied on the heavy crude to shop elsewhere for similar-grade crude—refiners such as Citgo, Valero, and Chevron.For Venezuela’s customers other than the United States, like India and China, US sanctions on Iran squeezed them even further. Already in March, shipments of Venezuela oil to India in April fell, and now India will even more strapped as its Iranian oil source is off the table as of last week when the waiver it had been given expired.



Iran has not minced words when it comes to the notion of OPEC members picking up the slack where oil is concerned. Iran last week made bold claims that Saudi Arabia and UAE will “draw the death and collapse of OPEC” should they fill the void left by Iranian oil barrels being restricted in the market, chastising OPEC members who wielded oil as a weapon. By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Electric Fracking Could Take Over The PermianOPEC Is Facing An Existential CrisisPipeline Bottlenecks Cost Canadian Producers $20 Billion

In its biggest provocation yet, Turkey has sent its Fatih drilling ship into Cypriot waters, launching drilling operations that have prompted a response from the U.S. and a Greek Cypriot counter-threat, according to Oilprice.com sources in Istanbul.With the U.S. and the EU chiming in this weekend with their own warnings, today, Turkish Naval Forces on board the Fatih reported threats over their radios of international arrest warrants coming from the Greek Cypriot authorities if the vessel does not vacate Cyprus’ Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).As of this afternoon, the ship’s location is still in the EEZ, with Turkey refusing to budge.


(Click to enlarge)Much is at stake for Cyprus, which stands to benefit enormously—both financially and geopolitically—if supermajor exploration efforts bear fruit. Exxon has made substantial discoveries in Block 10, which is in the EEZ, whose delimitation Turkey contests. In March this year, Exxon said that it had encountered commercial quantities of hydrocarbons in Block 10’s Glafkos 1 well, estimating some 5-8 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. “We urge Turkish authorities to halt these operations and encourage all parties to act with restraint,” U.S. officials said on Sunday, following a similar warning by the EU made just days prior.Earlier this year, a high-level Turkish government official told us that in a future standoffs over oil drilling in the disputed territory, Turkey could protect its civilian ships “with military ship”.



Turkey is following through on a threat to start drilling in disputed waters that it made most recently in February.On Monday, Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan address a NATO meeting in Ankara, saying that Turkey fully expected the military alliance to support Turkey’s rights in the Eastern Mediterranean.A Turkish Foreign Ministry statement on the same day criticized the U.S. warning as being “neither constructive nor compatible with international law”. It also said that “the Greek Cypriot Administration’s EEZ delimitation agreements with the countries in the region are not valid for Turkey and the Turkish Cypriots, and one of these agreements violates Turkey’s continental shelf rights”.Turkey repeated its intention to continue its natural gas and oil drilling in the region, saying that “our drilling and seismic vessels will resolutely continue their activities in our continental shelf in the areas where our Government granted the Turkish Petroleum licenses in 2009 and 2012”.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Electric Fracking Could Take Over The PermianOPEC Is Facing An Existential CrisisPipeline Bottlenecks Cost Canadian Producers $20 Billion

South Sudan and South Africa have inked an exploration and production sharing deal for oil in a sign that South Sudan is well on its way to put its best foot forward in order to attract additional foreign investments in its oil sector.The deal with South Africa is its second since gaining its hard-fought independence that leftWhile South Sudan has made strides in recovering since its independence, UN peace-keeping head Jean-Pierre Lacroix said near the end of 2018 that this peace isn’t yet fully sustainable, with reports that clashes are still popping up from time to time.



South Sudan has sub-Saharan Africa’s third-largest crude reserves, estimated at 5 billion barrels of proved crude oil reserves, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA).South Sudan’s oil flows were reportedly uninterrupted by the conflict in its northern neighbor, Sudan, a couple of weeks ago, after its president was overthrown by Sudan’s military. Sudan holds all of the cards to South Sudan’s oil industry, which relies on it completely for moving oil to international markets.South Sudan expects its oil production to increase to 270,000 barrels per day by the end of this year, from 180,000 bpd now. The planned increase for 2019 is still below its pre-civil-war era of 350,000 bpd.



South Africa and South Sudan were in negotiations in March for a $1 billion refinery in South Sudan.South Sudan has come under intense scrutiny from the International Monetary Fund in recent months after taking loans from Chinese companies in exchange for oil—oil that it has yet to get out of the ground.South Sudan is still on the lookout for additional investments in its petroleum industry across the entire value chain as it continues to struggle for peace.

The United States is working with oil producers like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to ensure India has enough crude supply after the end of all sanction waivers for Iranian buyers, but the U.S. can’t ensure its own oil will be sold to India at preferential prices, American officials said on Monday.  The U.S. is working with its allies in OPEC—Saudi Arabia and the UAE—to make sure that India has sufficient supplies after the American sanction waivers expired last week, according to the U.S. Ambassador to India, Kenneth Juster, as quoted by Indian media today.India has been Iran’s second-largest oil customer after China and has been buying Iranian oil at discount rates as Iran was offering very attractive terms to Indian buyers, including almost free shipping and an extended credit period for payment.



India’s oil imports from Iran increased by some 5 percent between March 2018 and March 2019 compared to the previous fiscal year through March 2018, because Indian refiners rushed to buy Iranian oil before the U.S. sanctions kicked in in November and hurried to wind up purchases ahead of the waiver’s end last week.According to Indian outlet NDTV, Iran supplied more than one tenth of India’s crude oil demand in the fiscal year ended March 2019.The end of the U.S. sanction waivers will hit India hard because it has to pay more for alternate oil supplies at a time when the country is in the middle of elections and higher gasoline and diesel prices will not sit well with any voter.Related: This World-Class Shale Frontier Just Opened Up



Last week, reports emerged that India had asked the United States if it would be flexible in allowing it to continue importing Iranian oil despite the end of the sanction waivers.While the U.S. is working with the Saudis and emirates to ensure Indian supply, America can’t guarantee attractive discount prices to Indian buyers, U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross said in New Delhi on Monday.Asked if the U.S. would consider selling its crude to India at discount rates to offset the expected shortfall in Iranian supply, Ross said, as carried by Reuters: “Oil is owned by private people so the government cannot force people to make concessionary prices.”   By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:What Explains China’s Thirst For Saudi OilNigeria Shuts In More Oil After Protests In Niger DeltaBuffett’s Big Bet On Energy

Israel’s Energy Minister Yuval Steinitz ordered on Sunday that the country’s only operating natural gas field, the offshore Tamar field, be closed as a precaution after violence between militants in the Gaza Strip and Israel flared up at the end of last week.  The natural gas from the Tamar field is being pumped by a subsea pipeline from a rig which is within the range of some the hundreds of rockets fired from the Gaza Strip at Israel over the past few days.  The temporary closure of the Tamar field put Israel’s energy supply into an emergency mode, as power plants need to use alternatives to the natural gas they receive from the field to keep operating, according to The Times of Israel. The power plants will be burning diesel, coal, and liquefied natural gas (LNG) from a ship anchored in Israel’s north.



The emergency energy situation was initially expected to last a week, The Times of Israel reported on Sunday, citing Hebrew-language business daily The Marker.The latest flare-up between Israel and militants in the Gaza Strip saw some of the worst fighting in years, according to The Wall Street Journal. More than 600 rockets were fired from the Gaza Strip to Israel, which in turn responded with strikes on military targets in the Gaza Strip. Lives were lost on both sides, including civilians, at the peak of the fighting on Sunday.Early on Monday, Palestinian militants said that they had agreed a ceasefire with Israel, after a weekend of heightened hostilities which killed at least four Israelis and 25 Palestinians.



Israel’s energy ministry said on Monday that the Tamar gas field would resume operations after the ceasefire was agreed, and that energy minister Steinitz had instructed Noble Energy, the Texas-based operator of the field, to prepare to restart pumping natural gas.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Middle East Oil Giants Are About To Upend Oil Trading19 Historical Oil Disruptions, And How No.20 Will Shock MarketsA New Mega Cartel Is Emerging In Oil Markets

Occidental Petroleum has updated the terms of its bid for Anadarko by saying it will pay 80 percent of the US$38 billion it is offering in cash, negating the need for shareholder approval. That is up from 50 percent earlier and just 25 percent when the original offer was made, the Houston Chronicle notes.Occidental submitted its counter bid during negotiations between Anadarko and Chevron, which had offered US$65 per share or US$33 billion for the whole company. Oxy’s bid certainly beats the Chevron offer in terms of size, but some shareholders of Anadarko were nervous about the portion of the cash in the offer, so Oxy raised it and then raised it again.



In another update, Occidental said it would sell Anadarko’s African assets for US$8.8 billion if it wins the bidding war. The assets are spread from Algeria to Ghana, Mozambique, and South Africa. The buyer is French Total. The deal, according to Oxy’s press release would constitute a part of a divestment program worth between US$10 and US$15 billion and will facilitate the integration of Anadarko into the company.The Anadarko acquisition has become the deal of the year with no comparable one likely to take place anytime soon. Anadarko is one of the largest oil and gas producers in the Permian Basin where Occidental is the largest. The appetite for the company is the latest indication that the Permian has become for the U.S. energy industry.



Anadarko’s board first accepted Chevron’s offer for US$33 billion and rejected Occidental’s initial proposal with the 25-percent cash option. When the latter sweetened the bid by raising the cash portion of the deal, Anadarko’s board agreed to consider it if Chevron fails to top it. With the further sweetening that Oxy has now done, Anadarko may have some serious considering to do, whatever Chevron comes up with as a counter bid.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:This World-Class Shale Frontier Just Opened UpMiddle East Oil Giants Are About To Upend Oil TradingElectric Fracking Could Take Over The Permian

Russia’s oil production will be cut by another 1 million barrels per day over the next week after its oil exports were restricted due to contamination issues, according to Reuters.The contaminated crude oil was shipped through Transneft’s Druzhba pipeline, causing the pipeline operator to call on Russian oil producers to request reduced volumes—a 10 percent reduction.The contamination issue—which Transneft says was deliberate—has been quite a headache for Russia, but European refineries are taking most of the brunt, and have caused Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary to release 8 million barrels of oil reserves to keep their refineries refining, and comes at a time when the market is already nervous about tightening supplies as crude production falls in Iran and Venezuela.



Russia’s oil production had already fallen in April to 11.23 million barrels per day, although the levels were still above its production quota that it agreed to with OPEC of 11.191 million bpd. Russia has dropped hints over the last month that it may be reluctant to extend the oil quotas past June—although it has yet to reduce production to those levels.Saudi Arabia has vowed to respond to market needs as they arise should a shortage occur, but Saudi Arabia was referring to the production losses in Venezuela and Iran—not Russia.Transneft is largely expected to resume oil flows over the next couple of weeks, although it may take some time to repair any damaged refinery equipment as a result of the corrosive contaminates found in the crude oil.



A criminal investigation is underway to locate the source of the contaminated crude oil. The first clean oil arrived in Belarus today since the complaints of contamination were made. By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Oil Market Is Set To Become Very Tight Later This YearVenezuelan Oil Production Could Plunge To ZeroBP CEO: Trump Is The Wild Card In Oil Markets

Shell is seeking to sell its minority stake in a liquefied natural gas (LNG) project in Indonesia, hoping to get US$1 billion for its 35-percent interest in the US$15-billion project, Reuters reported on Friday, quoting banking and industry sources.  Shell said earlier this year that it had completed its US$30-billion divestment program, launched in 2016 to help fund the acquisition of BG Group in 2015.LNG is a core business for Shell, which is the world’s top trader of the super-chilled fuel. LNG was a key contributor to Shell’s better-than-expected Q1 2019 results, and its chief financial officer Jessica Uhl said just yesterday on the Q1 earnings call that “overall we’re pleased with our portfolio” as regards LNG and “We’ve got Indonesia, Tanzania, further opportunities in Australia as well.”



Yet, the project in Indonesia, the Abadi LNG Project, has already been delayed by at least two years and the government of Indonesia has instructed the project developers to change their initial proposal for a floating LNG platform to onshore LNG development.Japan’s Inpex Corporation is the operator and the majority holder with a 65-percent stake in the project, while Shell owns the other 35 percent.Shell’s potential exit from Indonesia would be another sign that the government of one of the largest economies in South East Asia is struggling to keep energy investments while changing regulations.Related: Has OPEC Reached Its Real Output Cut Goals?



As early as in March 2016, the Indonesian energy regulator said that Inpex would be delaying the final investment decision on the project until 2020, meaning that the project would not come online until 2026 at the very least.In March last year, Inpex said that it was about to begin pre-FEED work for the project and will draft a detailed revised plan of development after the authorities instructed the company in 2016 to change its plans from floating LNG platform to onshore LNG development.The head of Indonesia’s oil and gas task force SKK Migas, Dwi Soetjipto, said last month that Indonesia is yet to approve the revised plan and that authorities and the operators have not yet agreed how much the project would cost, according to Reuters.  By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Oil Market Is Set To Become Very Tight Later This YearBP CEO: Trump Is The Wild Card In Oil MarketsWhat’s Behind The Mid-Week Oil Price Crash

A shortage of nickel, copper, and other metals used in electric car batteries is looming, according to a Tesla executive, quoted by two unnamed Reuters sources. The executive, Tesla global supply manager for battery metals Sarah Maryssael, spoke at a closed-doors event with miners, lawmakers, and regulators.Later, a company spokesperson told Reuters the concern was not immediate, but rather a long-term expectation. However, a shortage of some of the metals used in electric cars is not out of the question.Copper, for example, features heavily in EVs, with the highest concentration in its engine: the amount of copper used in EV engines is twice as high as the amount used in internal combustion engines. With millions of EVs planned to hit roads in the future, it’s easy to see why a shortage concern may be in order.This is all the more true since it’s not just EVs that use a lot of copper. Reuters notes that devices such as Apple’s Alexa and Alphabet’s Nest smart thermostat also use a lot of it, and with product numbers growing, demand for copper for just these two products will soar from 38,000 tons to date to as much as 1.5 million tons in 2030, according to projections from consultancy BSRIA.Copper mining, meanwhile, is not seeing a lot of investment right now and this lack of investment may come back to bite if this fast rate of growth in demand for the basic metal persists.There is also the problem with ethical mining, which mostly concerns cobalt. Most cobalt comes from the Democratic Republic of Congo, which is notorious for its child labor practices and artisanal cobalt mining.The alternative is sourcing battery metals from ethical locations, and this is already being done, according to Maryssael, through partnerships between the carmaker and miners in Australia, Canada, and Chile.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Venezuelan Oil Production Could Plunge To ZeroDem Presidential Hopeful Shames Oil Workers, Refuses Oil-Related Campaign MoneyWhat’s Behind The Mid-Week Oil Price Crash

Hungary, Poland, and the Czech Republic are releasing a total of 8 million barrels from their respective strategic petroleum reserves to keep refineries operating after contaminated crude forced the shutdown of the Druzhba pipeline carrying oil from Russia to customers in Europe, industry sources told Reuters on Friday.  Last week, several countries, including Poland, shut down the flow of Russian crude oil via the 1-million-bpd Druzhba pipeline after traces of contamination were found. The oil was contaminated with organic chlorine, a substance used in oil production to boost output but dangerous in high amounts for refining equipment. The amounts of the chemical were found to be at levels much higher than the maximum allowable amount.The tainted oil that flew through the Druzhba oil pipeline from Russia to customers in Europe was “deliberately contaminated” at a private terminal, according to Russia’s oil pipeline operator Transneft.



Earlier this week, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said that Poland had tapped its emergency crude oil stockpiles in order to keep key refineries operating.The energy ministry of Poland decided to release 500,000 tons of oil from its strategic stocks on April 26, and another 300,000 tons on April 30, a spokeswoman for the ministry told Reuters in an emailed comment on Thursday.Now it’s up to Poland’s refiners PKN Orlen and Lotos to decide when to use those stocks and how much to draw from them, according to the energy ministry’s spokeswoman.



The Druzhba pipeline shutdown has also impacted deliveries to Germany and Slovakia, but these two countries haven’t decided yet if they would tap into their emergency stockpiles.Russia said at the end of last week that it expects the Druzhba pipeline to return to full normal deliveries within two weeks, while the state oil company of Belarus, Belneftekhim, said on Thursday that crude oil meeting standards arrived via the Druzhba pipeline at the Belarusian border with Russia on May 2.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:19 Historical Oil Disruptions, And How No.20 Will Shock MarketsA New Mega Cartel Is Emerging In Oil MarketsOil Falls On Soaring U.S. Crude Inventories

Despite an escalating situation in Venezuela, oil exports from the country remained perhaps surprisingly stable in April, at an average daily rate of 1.06 million barrels, Reuters reports, citing its own shipping and trading data.Shipments of Venezuelan crude to China increased during last month, as did cargoes bound for India. The flow of oil from Venezuela to Cuba continued despite attempts by the opposition to put a stop to these.China took in about a third of the total, at 337,000 bpd, with India importing 27 percent, and Europe a tenth of the total.



Reuters notes, though, that this month things may change, as exports to the US fall even further. The only reason they haven’t already seems to be the grace period Washington gave U.S. importers of Venezuelan crude to wrap up their business with state-owned PDVSA. The deadline for this wrap up was April 28.According to Reuters data and company documents, the PDVSA loadings program for May was sparse, but shipments for China and Cuba, as well as Russia will in all likelihood continue. Venezuela is repaying Chinese and Russian loans with crude.Venezuela’s exports plummeted by 40 percent in February, after a month earlier the U.S. imposed the toughest sanctions yet on Caracas, targeting specifically PDVSA. Since then, however, they have stabilized around 1 million bpd. Stockpiles, meanwhile, have declined by 3.8 million barrels as PDVSA’s production continues to fall. To date, Venezuela’s crude oil inventories stand at around 32 million barrels, according to Kpler data.



Meanwhile, Juan Guaido’s opposition’s attempts to topple Nicolas Maduro’s government continue. Despite his repeated calls for more protests and striking across the country, and an attempt at a military coup earlier this week, the situation remains unchanged, bar the rising violence during the protests and counter-protests organized by the government. Many consider the army the key to a regime change in Venezuela.

Iran’s armed forces should prepare as if an attack were imminent, General Abdolrahim Mousavi instructed on Thursday just as the US waivers on Iranian crude oil sanctions expired, according to Radio Farda.“All forces should prepare themselves as though an attack can occur tomorrow and continuously engage in war exercises,” Mousavi told IRNA, the official government news agency of Iran, accusing the United States of vigorously pursuing a regime change.“We will crush the murderous America at the height of its power,” Mousavi had said at the end of March, when a waiver extension was still a possibility.



Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei tweeted a similar warning on Wednesday, suggesting that “the enemy’s war posture” was there, even if it did not appear to be so publicly. The United States has denied that it has a goal of changing the regime in Iran.“Today enemy is attacking us on all areas: they devise plans to strike Iran on economy, intelligence infiltration & cyberspace,” Khamenei said on Twitter in one of five tweets on the subject, adding that the current US administration was more transparent in its stance, contrary to previous US administrations “who wore velvet gloves over their iron hands.”The United States moved to end the eight waivers it had granted to purchasers of Iranian oil in an effort to bring the country’s exports to zero, or as near zero as possible. The move has elicited numerous retaliatory comments from the sanctioned country toward the United States, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates as pressure over its crude oil exports intensifies.

Turkey will not be able to “quickly” source oil from alternate sources after the US ended the waivers previously extended to Turkey for the purchase of Iranian oil, Turkish foreign minister said on Thursday as cited by Reuters.The waivers that the United States granted eight countries including China, India, and Turkey officially ended yesterday.



Turkey’s stance that it will be unable to find oil elsewhere “quickly” insinuates that the waiver expiration came as a surprise, although the expiration date was announced at the onset of the six-month waivers. Still, many analysts assumed that the United States would again grant waivers to at least some of the eight countries—and were likely disappointed that waivers were not forthcoming.“It does not seem possible for us to diversify the sources of the oil we import in a short time,” Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said. Turkey’s refineries, according to Cavusoglu, are not equipped to process crude oil from just any other country, and would therefore require retooling—something that is not only time intensive but costly.



This challenge highlights a growing concern as more and more Iranian barrels are cut out from the marketplace: all crude oil is not equal. And Turkey’s relations with alternate suppliers such as Saudi Arabia and UAE are less than amicable.India, too, has expressed concerns regarding crude oil supplies, but India has resigned itself to the fact that it must look to other crude sources. India’s main concern now is that the end to the waivers brought about significant price increases—a fact that is a grave concern for oil-thirsty India. While India is not expressing defiance over the waiver expiration, as recently as last weekend, India’s External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj asked once more that the United States show flexibility with its expectations regarding oil purchases.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Venezuelan Oil Production Could Plunge To ZeroEconomists: Higher Oil Prices Here To StayHas OPEC Reached Its Real Output Cut Goals?

U.S. exports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) to Europe have surged by 272 percent since July 2018, when the United States and the European Union (EU) pledged to boost their strategic energy cooperation, the European Commission said on Thursday.  In the nine months since the July 25, 2018 Joint Statement after a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker on working toward zero tariffs and boosting energy cooperation, U.S. LNG exports to the EU surged by 272 percent compared to the period beforehand, the Commission said while the EU hosted an EU-U.S. energy forum.The EU is keen to diversify its energy supply as most of its members want to diminish their reliance on Russian pipeline gas.



According to the European Commission, in 2017 Europe accounted for more than 10 percent of total U.S. LNG exports, up from 5 percent in 2016. In 2018 around 11 percent of U.S. LNG exports went to the EU, while in the nine-month period from August 2018 to April 2019, in which exports surged by 272 percent, that share jumped to almost 30 percent.“Natural gas will remain an important component of the EU’s energy mix in the near future as we move towards cleaner sources of energy. Given our heavy dependence on imports, U.S. liquefied natural gas, if priced competitively, could play an increasing and strategic role in EU gas supply,” European Commissioner for Energy and Climate Miguel Arias Cañete said.U.S. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry commented:



“When it comes to natural gas, we each have what the other needs to derive tremendous mutual benefit from advancing our energy relationship.”“The U.S. & the EU remain ideal partners for energy cooperation & I am excited by how our LNG trade with Europe continues to grow and provide economic & national security benefits to all involved, while contributing to the strength, security, & resilience of our NATO alliance,” Secretary Perry said on Twitter.

OPEC is trying not to mix politics with oil policy, the cartel’s Secretary General Mohammad Barkindo said on Thursday in Iran, after the Islamic Republic has stepped up rhetoric against the U.S. sanctions in recent days.“OPEC tries to depoliticize oil,” Iran’s oil ministry quoted Barkindo as saying on the sidelines of an event in Tehran.The U.S. is ending sanction waivers for all Iranian oil buyers and both the U.S. Department of State and President Donald Trump have expressed confidence that the U.S. allies within OPEC—Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE)—will step in to fill the gap that the U.S. sanctions on Iran would leave in the global oil market.While the Saudis and the UAE have said that they would meet market requirements, none of them has announced yet any imminent production increase to offset Iranian losses.



Iran, however, is accusing the U.S. and its allies of using oil as a political tool and has repeatedly said that American sanctions can’t and won’t bring Iranian oil exports to zero.According to the news service of Iran’s oil ministry, Shana, OPEC’s Barkindo told reporters today that “Eliminating Iran from the oil market is impossible.”“Over the 60 years since establishment of OPEC, we have faced many challenges, but what has always helped us is the unity ... If we can preserve this unity, we can overcome the problems again,” Barkindo was quoted as saying.Earlier this week, Iran’s Oil Minister Bijan Zangeneh said “Using oil as a weapon against two founding member of OPEC (Iran and Venezuela) will transform the unity in this organization into division and spell the demise and collapse of OPEC. They have to accept responsibility for such thing.”



Days before that, Amirhossein Zamaninia, Iranian deputy oil minister for international affairs and trading, said:“The idea that some countries can offset shortages caused by removing Iran’s crude oil from the market is both politically and technically unfitting.”“These sanctions are the indication of US’s schoolyard bullying reaction to the changes in global balance of power,” according to Zamaninia.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Oil Prices Tank On Record U.S. Production, Surging InventoriesEconomists: Higher Oil Prices Here To StayMexico Puts The Squeeze On Fuel Theft

Tesla said on Thursday that it would be looking to raise as much as US$2.3 billion through offering common stock and convertible bonds in a move that analysts describe as “net positive” and probably long overdue.Tesla’s chief executive Elon Musk had insisted in recent years that the electric vehicle (EV) maker didn’t need capital injections despite burning cash fast and rarely posting profits.Many analysts, on the other hand, have been saying for several quarters that Tesla needs to raise capital—in the region of US$2 billion to US$4 billion—to start delivering on its bold promises, or as Tesla bears have claimed, simply to keep the company afloat.   



After disappointing deliveries and a big loss in the first quarter of this year, Musk suggested last week that “There is some merit to raising capital,” and said that the time may be about right to raise capital.In its earnings release last week, Tesla said that it ended Q1 2019 with US$2.2 billion of cash and cash equivalents, down by US$1.5 billion from the end of 2018. The reduction was the result of a US$920-million convertible bond repayment and an increase in the number of vehicles in transit to customers at the end of Q1.So Tesla announced on Thursday offerings of US$650 million of common stock and US$1.35 billion aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due in 2024. Musk will take part in the offering by buying US$10 million of Tesla’s common stock, the company said, noting that it “intends to use the net proceeds from the offerings to further strengthen its balance sheet, as well as for general corporate purposes.”Related: Contaminated Crude Adds Insult To Injury For European Refiners



Tesla “needed to rip the bandaid off” and the raising of capital is a “net positive” move, Dan Ives, managing director at Wedbush, told Bloomberg on Thursday, commenting on Tesla’s capital raising plan.According to Wedbush, Tesla may need US$3-4 billion, but the US$2.3 billion capital raise is a good start, which would lead to a “near-term relief rally” on this news.Tesla’s (NASDAQ: TSLA) shares were indeed rallying 4.27 percent at 2:12 EDT on Thursday.By Tsvetana Paraskova for OilpricecomMore Top Reads from Oilprice.com:Mexico Puts The Squeeze On Fuel TheftOil Prices Tank On Record U.S. Production, Surging InventoriesEconomists: Higher Oil Prices Here To Stay

In the wake of the Extinction Rebellion riots that led to more than a thousand arrests with people gluing themselves to buildings and vandalizing the Shell HQ, a panel has urged the UK government to urgently adopt new policies for anything from eating habits to energy consumption to avert the worst effects of climate change.The Associated Press reports the Committee on Climate Change had recommended to the government such measures as reducing the consumption of meat and dairy products, changing the way farms do business, and making electric cars the only cars people can buy by 2035. By 2050, according to the panel, the country should be greenhouse gas emission-free.“We can all see that the climate is changing and it needs a serious response. The government should accept the recommendations and set about making the changes needed to deliver them without delay,” the chairman of the panel said.



While some might see the 2050 zero-emission deadline as difficult to reach, environmentalists argue it is too far in the future. However, the panel said, 2050 was the “most credible,” as quoted by the AP.“An earlier date has been proposed by some groups and might send a stronger signal internationally to those considering increasing their own ambition, but only if it’s viewed as credible.”Even so, an alliance of environmentalist groups has insisted the government try to achieve its emission goals faster, by 2045.



“The problem is, we’ve been acting as if we have time,” said the head of climate change at WWF, Gareth Redmond-King. “But if we want a world with coral reefs, safe coastal cities and enough food for everyone, we must act now.”In the meantime, Extinction Rebellion has warned the 11-day protests that paralyzed parts of London public transport are only the beginning of what a co-founder of the organization called a revolution. Now, the group is calling for mass refusal to pay mortgages and student loans in an attempt to motivate the government to consider alternatives to current economic model most of the world is using.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Shell Beats Estimates And Rivals In Strong Q1Economists: Higher Oil Prices Here To StayHow The Renewable Revolution Is Reshaping Geopolitics

A junior Canadian gas E&P company has shut down abruptly, leaving as many as 4,700 wells behind, CBC reports, quoting the Alberta Energy Regulator, which said it had sent Trident Exploration Corp. an order to manage its wells, to which the company did not respond.Trident closed two days ago and announced it would not be returning any money to shareholders or holders of unsecured bonds, adding it had well abandonment and reclamation liabilities of US$244.78 million (C$329 million) to deal with.According to the Alberta Energy Regulator, these 4,700 wells add to more than 3,000 abandoned wells in Canada’s oil heartland that are currently awaiting remediation. The regulator also said it had been working with the company to smooth its exit from the industry and had ordered it to decommission the wells or transfer them to another company. Trident failed to comply with the order, the AER said.""Trident does not have the funds to operate its infrastructure or enter into creditor protection. As a result, they have decided to walk away, leaving more than 4,400 licensed sites, many of them active, without an operator,"" the watchdog told CBC.Data from the Alberta Energy Regulator says there are some 170,000 abandoned wells in the province, most of these sealed and taken out of service or reclaimed. The number represents more than a third of the total well count in Alberta, with the watchdog noting in its overview on the topic that even their abandonment, the wells remain the responsibility of the company that owns them.Two years ago, think tank C. D. Howe warned Alberta was facing a well cleanup and reclamation bill of US$5.95 billion (C$8 billion) and needed to change the way it made companies take financial charge of the abandonment and reclamation of their wells. Since then, this figure has grown.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Oil Falls On Soaring U.S. Crude InventoriesOverly Bullish Hedge Funds Set The Stage For Oil Price DropSaudi Arabia, UAE “Draw The Death And Collapse Of OPEC”

India has asked the United States if it would be flexible in allowing India to continue importing Iranian crude oil despite the end of the sanction waivers on May 1, according to an Indian newspaper on Tuesday.The request, according to reports, came from Indian External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj in a discussion with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, according to anonymous sources quoted by the Hindustan Times.



Swaraj explained to the Secretary of State that India was not in a position to immediately source enough crude oil from suppliers other than Iran—an issue that is particularly sensitive because India is in the middle of an election, and the new administration would be rendering a decision on how to handle this issue.Pompeo was noncommittal, according to sources, telling Swaraj that that decision was no longer being handled at that level.



The United States announced last week that it would not be extending any of the eight waivers that it had issued to buyers of Iranian oil in an effort to drive Iranian oil exports to zero.That figure is in doubt, however, with China and perhaps Turkey largely expected to keep purchasing Iranian crude oil despite the US sanctions that will be in full force without exception as of May 2. But this theory, too, is now in doubt as a Reuters’ report today suggested that China is currently sitting on 20 million barrels of Iranian oil that has been stuck in port for the past six months, arriving there prior to the sanctions that were levied in November last year. The oil is now stuck in customs, even though China has had a waiver to import Iranian oil. Now that the sanction waivers are set to expire, the fact of the oil stuck in port is even more murky.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Economists: Higher Oil Prices Here To StaySaudi Arabia, UAE “Draw The Death And Collapse Of OPEC”U.S. Renewable Energy Just Set An Historic Record

As the acquisition war rages on over Anadarko, some analysts are suggesting that there will be additional mergers and acquisitions as major oil companies seek to increase their foothold in the US shale hotspot, the Permian Basin—but BP’s CEO Bob Dudley said on Wednesday that BP wasn’t currently on the hunt for oil and gas deals, according to CNBC, and wasn’t interested in Anadarko.BP has already made its move into US shale when it acquired last year assets of BHP Billiton worth US$10.8 billion. BHP unloaded the assets at a time when it was booking losses thanks to the 2014 price crash. This suggests that BP is not reluctant to take a piece of the US Shale pie, rather that it has already had its fair share in what Dudley at the time considered a “transformational” move.BP snagged BHP’s assets in not only the Permian, but also in the Eagle Ford and Haynesville basins as well, increasing its presence in US onshore oil and gas by more than half. While BP may be done with its acquisitions, CEO Dudley expects that other companies will continue to swap land and consolidate holdings as players in primarily the Permian look to cut costs.Anadarko, the most recent asset that has more than one suitor, has become a hot topic as first Chevron, then Occidental threw their hats into the ring to acquire the company with a large presence in the Permian. Anadarko had a preliminary deal with Chevron, but is rethinking the deal as Occidental’s bid topped Chevron’s, with Warren Buffett backing Occidental’s bid with $10 billion.  While mergers and acquisitions may increase in the coming months, the reality so far is that the value of US oil and gas mergers and acquisitions fell to a ten-year low in Q1, falling by a whopping 93% to $1.6 billion, according to Drillinginfo in its quarterly M&A review as reported by Reuters in early April.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:$1 Billion In Iranian Crude Is Stuck At This Chinese Oil HubOPEC Oil Production Slips To 4-Year LowHigh-Cost Oil Faces Existential Risk

The U.S. Department of the Interior plans to announce on Thursday the final draft of proposals to roll back some offshore oil drilling requirements imposed after the Deepwater Horizon disaster, after complaints from the oil industry that some of the regulations are burdensome without necessarily improving safety, Bloomberg reported on Wednesday, citing two people familiar with the plans.The Obama Administration imposed new technical regulations on drilling and drilling equipment in 2016, after reviewing the requirements and what went wrong in the Deepwater Horizon disaster in 2010 that killed 11 people and resulted in the worst U.S. offshore oil spill.Now, according to Bloomberg’s sources, the Trump Administration is set to ease some of the rules, such as allowing third parties—not only Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE)-approved organizations—to inspect and certify the so-called blowout preventers at offshore oil platforms.In proposed rules from May 2018, BSEE said that its consultations with the industry showed that “oil and natural gas operators raised concerns about certain regulatory provisions that impose undue burdens on their industry, but do not significantly enhance worker safety or environmental protection.”



“Other stakeholders suggested that certain regulatory requirements do not properly account for advances or limitations in technology and processes,” the bureau said.According to the API, the updated offshore well control rule would improve on its 2016 predecessor “by providing flexibility to meet specific challenges across a variety of offshore conditions while encouraging innovation and technologies that help improve safety.”Related: 19 Historical Oil Disruptions, And How No.20 Will Shock MarketsCommenting on the current well control rule, the API says: “Unfortunately, this one-size-fits-all approach doesn’t consider the unique characteristics of every well, from its geology and depth to the pressure and temperature. These prescriptive requirements could also stifle innovation and implementation of new operational technologies.”



While the oil industry and its organizations argue that the easing of some requirements is good for the offshore industry and technological development, opponents say that relaxing rules would endanger oil workers and the environment.“As the public just saw with the Boeing crashes, letting the offshore drilling industry regulate itself is a recipe for disaster,” Amit Narang, a regulatory policy expert at watchdog group Public Citizen, told Bloomberg.

Some scientists and a British Columbian politician say that the oil tanks of the Trans Mountain on Burnaby Mountain would represent a huge risk to residents in the area in case of an earthquake—a claim that Trans Mountain is dismissing.An earth sciences professor and a retired structural engineer from the Simon Fraser University (SFU) said in a report and at a news conference on Tuesday that even though the risk of a big earthquake is not high, in case of such event the risk that the oil tank farm poses is “off the scale.”The scientists and NDP federal election candidate for Burnaby North-Seymour 2019, Svend Robinson, say that the issue should be immediately addressed.“The sloshing after an earthquake would create wave actions against the tank sides, and, if it broke, any spark would ignite it,” retired structural engineer Gordon Dunnet told StarMetro Vancouver.



John Clague, professor in SFU’s Department of Earth Sciences, says that “This problem could be addressed, it’s not responsible to not look at it.”Trans Mountain, for its part, said in an email to The Star Vancouver:“In 65 years of operation, we’ve never had a storage tank fire or structural incident with one of our tanks,” noting that it has emergency and prevention management plans that keep its terminals operating safely.Related: Overly Bullish Hedge Funds Set The Stage For Oil Price DropBritish Columbia has been strongly opposing the expansion of the Trans Mountain project, which is now owned by the federal government of Canada. The fierce opposition in British Columbia has forced Kinder Morgan to reconsider its commitment to expand the Trans Mountain pipeline, and to sell the project to the Canadian government in August 2018.



According to Dunnet, the new tanks that would be built if Trans Mountain were to expand would be built according to standards, but the old ones—built in 1953—are a real concern in case a strong earthquake rocks the area.According to NDP’s Robinson, the tanks built in 1953 on Burnaby Mountain are “huge concerns about the risk of fire and spillover during an earthquake that would threaten residents in the area and at SFU including UniverCity.

The small West African country Gambia has awarded BP the exploration rights to drill for oil and gas in an offshore block which another company claims it has the rights to explore.Gambia and BP signed on Tuesday a petroleum exploration contract, giving the UK supermajor “the legal rights” to explore for oil and gas potential in block A1 offshore Gambia, the office of the Gambian president Adama Barrow said in a statement posted on Facebook.  “This is about looking for oil and gas in the deep water where BP would be able to connect the government of the Gambia with our partners at GNPC to explore for oil and if it is successful to develop that oil in the future,” Jonathan Evans, V.P. Africa New Ventures at BP, said, as quoted by the Gambian presidential office.



However, another producer, African Petroleum Corporation, claims that it still holds the rights to the block that was just awarded to BP. Back in 2017, Gambia stripped African Petroleum of its license for the A1 block, saying it had expired while the company hadn’t met contractual obligations. African Petroleum has launched arbitration at the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID).In a statement on Wednesday, African Petroleum said that it “continues to reserve its rights in relation to the A1 licence and will continue with its efforts to protect its interest in the A1 licence through the ongoing ICSID arbitration process.”BP, for its part, intends to begin exploring offshore Gambia—which borders Senegal where large gas finds have been recently made—with an environmental impact assessment, followed by a two-year period of drilling, exploration, and development of the first well.



According to BP’s Evans, as quoted by Gambia’s president’s office, it could take close to a decade for Gambia to receive revenues, if exploration efforts are successful.

The Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) is launching Abu Dhabi’s second competitive bid round for oil and gas exploration of conventional and unconventional resources, the state oil firm said on Wednesday.ADNOC and Abu Dhabi are opening for bidding five new blocks, including three offshore and two onshore blocks, with one of the onshore blocks offering two separate licensing opportunities for conventional and unconventional oil and gas, respectively. “Based on existing data from detailed petroleum system studies, seismic surveys, exploration and appraisal wells data, estimates suggest the blocks in the second bid round hold multiple billion barrels of oil and multiple trillion cubic feet of natural gas,” ADNOC said in today’s statement.ADNOC will be accepting bids by the end of November 2019, after which the company will evaluate the bids received. The Supreme Petroleum Council (SPC) will award the successful bidders, ADNOC said. The launch of second exploration bid round comes a year after ADNOC offered six oil and gas blocks for bidding in a first-ever competitive exploration and production bid round as part of its strategy to expand strategic partnerships in all business areas.The first bid round concluded in March 2019, in which Abu Dhabi awarded two offshore blocks in concessions to a consortium led by Italy’s oil and gas major Eni and Thailand’s PTT Exploration and Production Public Company Limited (PTTEP). One onshore block went to India’s Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited and Indian Oil Corporation Limited, another onshore block was awarded to Occidental Petroleum, and a third onshore block was awarded to Japan’s Inpex Corporation.“The launch of Abu Dhabi’s second licensing bid round builds on the momentum of the first and very successful competitive bid round,” Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber, UAE Minister of State and ADNOC Group CEO, said.“It demonstrates how ADNOC’s expanded approach to partnerships is enabling us to utilize value-add partnerships and smart technologies to drive new commercial opportunities and efficiently accelerate the exploration and development of Abu Dhabi’s untapped resources, in line with the leadership’s directives,” Al Jaber noted.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Oil Soars On Venezuela Coup AttemptContaminated Crude Adds Insult To Injury For European RefinersChina Set To Miss Shale Gas Production Target By A Mile

The leader of the Houthi uprising in Yemen, Mohammed Ali al-Houthi, has asked the United Nations to sell a cargo of crude to generate revenues that will be used for the purchase of fuel and salaries for public sector employees, Reuters reports, citing a tweet by the rebel leader.“We call on the U.N. and the Security Council to put in place a mechanism to sell Yemeni crude oil, including the oil in the (floating storage tank),” Al-Houthi tweeted, referring to a cargo of crude that has been floating off the coast of the country since the uprising that led to a war with Saudi Arabia began four years ago.Oil used to be a vital export commodity of one of the poorest countries in the Middle East but the war has put a stop to that. Oil has moreover become a point of conflict between the Houthis, who control most cities in Yemen, and the Saudi-backed Yemeni forces loyal to the government that the Houthis ousted.



Last August, the pro-government forces that control the oil-rich Shabwa province announced the first export cargo of crude since 2015, of half a million barrels. The oil was offered in an open tender, in which 35 companies from around the world took part. The winner was a Chinese company.Related: Overly Bullish Hedge Funds Set The Stage For Oil Price DropThe Houthis have accused Saudi Arabia of stealing more than half of the country’s oil production in collaboration with French Total—a company that has been present in Yemen since before the war.Despite these accusations, however, there is little the rebels could do to stop the Saudi-backed government from producing and exporting oil, apparently. Earlier this year, the government even said it planned to restore production to levels high enough to allow for exports of 75,000 bpd.



“We will maintain production from four blocks and are planning to build a pipeline to Arab Sea (Arabian Sea) to resume exports from these blocks,” oil minister Aws Abdullah Al-Awd told Reuters in February. The plans also involve raising crude oil production to 110,000 bpd this year.

Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway has committed to invest US$10 billion in equity in Occidental Petroleum if Occidental completes its proposed acquisition of Anadarko, Occidental said on Tuesday, a day after Anadarko said that it would resume talks with Occidental despite having agreed to a deal with Chevron.Contingent upon Occidental completing the acquisition of Anadarko, Berkshire Hathaway will receive 100,000 shares of Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock with a liquidation value of US$100,000 per share, together with a warrant to purchase up to 80.0 million shares of Occidental common stock at an exercise price of US$62.50 per share, Occidental said.“We have long believed that Occidental is uniquely positioned to generate compelling value from Anadarko’s highly complementary asset portfolio. We are thrilled to have Berkshire Hathaway’s financial support of this exciting opportunity,” Occidental’s president and CEO Vicki Hollub said.



On Monday, Anadarko said that it plans to resume negotiations with Occidental after Occidental announced last week a proposal to buy Anadarko at a higher price than Anadarko had agreed in a deal with Chevron announced earlier this month.While negotiations are being held, the Chevron Merger Agreement “remains in effect and accordingly the Anadarko board reaffirms its existing recommendation of the transaction with Chevron at this time,” Anadarko said yesterday, noting that there is no guarantee that the talks would necessarily result in a superior transaction than the one pending with Chevron.Chevron said on April 12 that it had entered into a definitive agreement to buy Anadarko in a stock and cash transaction valued at US$33 billion that would boost Chevron’s position in the Permian, the Gulf of Mexico, and in liquefied natural gas (LNG).



On April 24, Occidental Petroleum said that it is proposing to buy Anadarko at a higher price than the one Anadarko had accepted from Chevron, opening a bidding war for one of the U.S. companies with the strongest positions in the Permian.  By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com: 19 Historical Oil Disruptions, And How No.20 Will Shock MarketsAfrica’s Largest Oil Producer Aims To Double ProductionA New Mega Cartel Is Emerging In Oil Markets

Poland has tapped into its emergency oil reserves in order to keep key refineries operating after contaminated crude oil forced the shutdown of the Druzhba oil pipeline carrying oil from Russia to customers in Europe, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said on Tuesday.“Poland has notified us that they are releasing emergency oil stocks to maintain normal operations at their two refineries supplied on the line,” S&P Global Platts quoted a statement from the IEA.Last week, several countries, including Poland, shut down the flow of Russian crude oil via the Druzhba pipeline after traces of contamination were found. The oil was contaminated with organic chlorine, a substance used in oil production to boost output but dangerous in high amounts for refining equipment. The amounts of the chemical were found to be at levels much higher than the maximum allowable amount.



The tainted oil that flew through the Druzhba oil pipeline from Russia to customers in Europe was “deliberately contaminated” at a private terminal, according to Russia’s oil pipeline operator Transneft.While the contamination issue is squeezing oil supply to European refiners, OPEC’s production cuts are expected to support global oil prices this year, according to the monthly Reuters survey of 31 analysts and economists published on Tuesday.In this month’s survey, experts predicted that Brent Crude would average US$68.57 a barrel this year, up from US$67.12 they had expected in the Reuters poll in March.



WTI Crude, on the other hand, is expected to average US$60.23 a barrel in 2019, up from US$58.92 a barrel forecast in the March poll.Analysts raised their forecasts for a second month in a row and are now predicting the highest oil prices so far this year in the Reuters polls, as they see the market further tightening due to the end of the U.S. sanction waivers for all Iranian oil customers, Venezuela’s plunging production, and concern over potential outages in conflict-torn Libya.  By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Is This A Gamechanger For The Lithium Industry?A New Middle East Mega-War Is Unfolding Right Before Our EyesSaudi Arabia’s Dream Of $85 Oil Is Closer Than Ever

The biggest oil importers in Asia collectively bought 1.57 million bpd of oil from Iran in March, a 36-percent surge over February, as buyers rushed to use up the U.S. sanction waivers for Iranian oil purchases before they expire this week, Reuters reported on Tuesday, citing government data and trade sources.Asia’s top oil importers, who are also Iran’s biggest oil customers—China, India, Japan, and South Korea—saw their combined level of Iranian oil imports in March hit the highest amount in eight months, since July last year, the month before the U.S. slapped financial sanctions on Iran, followed by sanctions on Tehran’s oil industry in November.Back in November, the U.S. granted sanction waivers to eight key Iranian oil buyers, including these four Asian customers, to continue importing oil at reduced volumes. Amid uncertainties whether they would get their waivers extended, the Asian importers hurried to buy and load Iranian oil for March, to have enough time to close transactions in case their waivers end.



The U.S. announced last week that it was ending all waivers for Iranian oil, which expire this week.In March, China imported 541,134 bpd of Iranian oil, down by 25.5 percent on the year, according to the data Reuters has compiled. India’s imports were just 5.9 percent lower than last year’s imports in the same month, and stood at 405,000 bpd. Japan saw its Iranian oil imports surge by 48.8 percent on the year to 292,648 bpd, while South Korea’s imports fell by 10.6 percent to 334,387 bpd.India’s oil imports from Iran increased by some 5 percent between March 2018 and March 2019 compared to the previous fiscal year through March 2018, because Indian refiners rushed to buy Iranian oil before the U.S. sanctions kicked in in November and hurried to wind up purchases ahead of the waiver expiring this week.



According to analysts, China is not expected to cut off its purchases of Iranian oil, while Iran could try selling more oil ‘under the sanctions radar’, Bjarne Schieldrop, chief commodities analyst at SEB, said last week.

Venezuela’s opposition leader and self-declared interim president Juan Guaido has announced what he has termed the “final phase” in the opposition’s plan to take over the country from the Nicolas Maduro government, Reuters reports, citing Guaido’s call for the Venezuelan military to join what increasingly looks like a coup attempt.ccording to a Reuters reporter on site, about 70 armed men in military uniforms gathered at a military base together with Guaido and several hundred opposition supporters but about two hours after the opposition leader tweeted the announcement about the “final phase”, there was no visible escalation between opposition supporters and government forces. At the military base, the Reuters reporter said, government security forces fired tear gas at Guaido’s group.“We reject this coup movement, which aims to fill the country with violence,” Venezuela’s Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino said, as quoted by Reuters.



The Reuters report counters another statement by Guaido made to the Spanish unit of CNN, which said the Venezuelan army was not behind Maduro.“Evidently, there is no such backing of the armed forces to Maduro’s regime,"" he said, adding “It’s great news for the entire country that the military of Venezuela’s armed forces have taken this step. They were an important part of this. This was fundamental not only for a transitioning, but to recover Venezuela’s sovereignty. Here we are next to our legislators, the military and soon with the people of Venezuela. We are determined to conquer freedom for our country.”According to the country’s Foreign Minister, Jorge Arreaza, the Guaido announcement and the events that followed were part of an attempt at a coup d’etat backed by the United States and Colombia.



""We denounce before the international community the support of the Colombian government for this new attempt at a coup d'etat in Venezuela. All the unconstitutional actions of the last few months in Venezuela have been planned from Washington and Bogota,” the official said in a tweet.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Tesla Starts Price War In Solar Panel Market19 Historical Oil Disruptions, And How No.20 Will Shock MarketsU.S. Pipeline Boom Could End In Crisis

An Irish-based company has designed CO2-sucking metal columns that can clean up part of the carbon emissions released by cars. The company plans to install 1,200 such “metal trees” in the United States after a two-year test in Arizona proved they work, Reuters reports.Silicon Kingdom Holdings says its method of carbon capture is cheaper than others and it’s also effective: the 1,200 columns to be erected in the U.S. in the next stage of the company’s climate change fighting efforts can remove the annual emissions from 8,000 cars, or 36,500 metric tons of carbon dioxide. This may not be a whole lot given there were more than 270 million cars on U.S. roads last year, but it is a start.The start will be a pilot project that will probably take place in California, according to Silicon Kingdom Holdings. If that goes well over the planned two-year period of operation, the technology can be scaled to installations 100 times larger.



The technology Silicon Kingdom Holdings mimics the way actual trees absorb carbon dioxide and, according to a chemical engineering professor who was not involved in the project, belongs to a carbon capture industry segment that has a great potential.Direct carbon capture, or sucking the compound directly from the air, is a new field of research with only a few companies active, Jennifer Wilcox from Worcester Polytechnic Institute told Reuters. The reason is that the technology is more expensive than non-direct carbon capture methods. However, this is not the case with the Silicon Kingdom Holdings metal trees. Their technology, according to the researcher who invented it, Klaus Lackner, costs less than US$100 per ton of pure carbon dioxide.What makes the technology particularly promising is the fact that the carbon dioxide can be reused in a range of applications after being captured.



“You can buy liquid CO2 which is delivered by truck in order to fill fire extinguishers and myriad other things for prices between $100 and $200 a ton,” Lackner told Reuters.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:A New Mega Cartel Is Emerging In Oil MarketsRosneft Sees No Oil Deficit Looming As Iran Sanction Waivers EndIs This The End For India-Iran Energy Relations?

More companies see environmental issues as their top concern when making decisions regarding energy investments, a PwC survey among UK businesses has found.The PwC & Energy UK B2B Survey found that 46 percent of industrial and commercial businesses planned to invest in renewable energy more than they would invest in any other technology and that an even bigger portion of the respondent pool, at 53 percent, had business strategies in place that included an energy efficiency target.At the same time, the number of companies whose top priority in energy investments was low cost fell to less than a third, PwC said. The differences are marked based on the size of the companies as well.



Among small and medium-sized companies, cost concerns were still pretty important, with 42 percent of respondents from this segment saying they would base their energy investment decisions on its cost-cut potential. Still, this is less than half, even in this segment.Among commercial businesses, the portion of companies basing their energy investment decisions on cost considerations is even lower, at 21 percent. Of those among them that have an energy strategy, a third said they were more concerned about the environmental impact of their energy investment decisions than the cost reduction potential. However, the difference between the two groups was not too great, with those concerned most with costs at 27 percent of the sample.This picture is very different from the one that the survey from PwC and Energy UK revealed just two years ago. At the time, 46 percent of respondents were most concerned about costs with just a fifth citing environmental issues as their top priority.



""Energy suppliers - from traditional to disruptive new entrants - will need to adapt their approaches as the fight for market share within the energy transformation heats up,” said the head of energy for the UK at PwC, Steve Jennings, as quoted by Business Green. “This means providing much more than just cost savings - environmentally focused options will also be needed to win the hearts and minds of energy users.""By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:19 Historical Oil Disruptions, And How No.20 Will Shock MarketsWhy An OPEC Oil Supply Surge Won’t HappenA New Mega Cartel Is Emerging In Oil Markets

Michigan’s Attorney General Dana Nessel has threatened to “use every resource available” to shut down Enbridge’s Line 5 oil pipeline that runs under the Straits of Macinac, in a statement on Monday.Nessel was responding to media inquiries regarding her position on the oil pipeline and its fate.“I respect the Governor’s effort to find a swift and straightforward resolution to this issue but if unsuccessful I will use every resource available to our office to shut down Line 5 to protect our Great Lakes.”



Just a month ago, Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer ordered a halt to the work on a tunnel beneath the Straits as part of the plan to replace a section of Line 5, after Nessel voiced her opinion that the bill that allowed the construction of the tunnel violated the state’s constitution because “it went beyond what the bill’s title reflected.”Enbridge has long held the stance that replacing this section of Line 5 is the only way to lower the risk of oil leaking into Lakes Huron and Michigan to nearly zero.Michigan Legislature approved in December 2018 the pipeline project that would see the 65-year-old line replaced, but the battle for the fate of the pipeline remains.



The original project was expected to take between seven and ten years to complete, although environmental activists and lawmakers may see this timeline pushed back or canceled.Opponents of the pipeline replacement argue that moving oil and natural gas under the Straits of Macinac poses undue risk to the massive freshwater lakes that Michigan relies on, while proponents argue that replacing an aging line is better than doing nothing at all.Governor Whitmer called for the complete decommissioning of Line 5 on her campaign trail, but last month declined to rule out the possibility of Enbridge encasing a new line in a tunnel deep underneath the Straits.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Putin: Saudis Shouldn't Break Output Cut DealU.S. Pipeline Boom Could End In CrisisShocking Evidence Suggests Much Faster Global Warming

A new study published today by Rystad Energy forecasts that there will be more than a million kilometers of new oil and gas wells drilled by 2023 globally; the distance of these wells combined is more than the distance to the moon and back.Behind this push for oil and gas wells is North American shale, which, Rystad says, is expected to account for 600,000 kilometers of the million.


(Click to enlarge)Rystad’s Head of Consulting, Erik Reiso, refers to the drilling onslaught to be seen in North America as “in a league of its own thanks to the shale boom,” with six of ten of the new wells in North America drilled in shale basins—wells that are typical longer than other types of wells.Related: ‘’The Fat Margins Have Disappeared’’ - Big Oil DisappointsWhile the top four offshore operators are expected to account for a quarter of the new offshore wells, the top ten onshore operators will account for only a third of the new wells in the next five years.



Discoveries of conventional resources on a global scale in Q1 2019 hit 3.2 billion barrels of oil equivalent, Rystad said in a separate statement to Rig Zone on Monday, with February seeing 2.2 billion boe of that. More than 2.4 billion boe of that was discovered by oil majors, with ExxonMobil coming out on top.“If the rest of 2019 continues at a similar pace, this year will be on track to exceed last year’s discovered resources by 30 percent,” Rystad Upstream Analyst Taiyab Zain Shariff said in a company statement sent to Rig Zone.This search for new discoveries is as of yet not expected to slow this year, with another 35 high-impact exploration wells already planned, that if successful, will make 2019’s total discovered resources “the largest since the downturn of 2014,” Shariff added.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Is This A Gamechanger For The Lithium Industry?A New Middle East Mega-War Is Unfolding Right Before Our EyesSaudi Arabia’s Dream Of $85 Oil Is Closer Than Ever

In the months leading up to the Chevron and Occidental (NYSE: OXY)  bids for Anadarko Petroleum Corp (NYSE: APC), there were suspicious purchases of Anadarko securities, according to the Securities and Exchange Commission, who obtained an order to freeze the assets in question.The unknown purchases of the Anadarko securities used accounts in Britain and Cyprus, and could rake in millions in profits, according to the court filing cited by Reuters.Both Chevron and Occidental have bid in Anadarko, with Occidental’s price surpassing the offer made by Chevron. Anadarko today reported that it would continue to negotiate the deal with the higher of the two bids, Occidental. Occidental offered to buy Anadarko at $76 per share, giving Anadarko shareholders $38 in cash and 0.6094 shares of Occidental common stock for each share of Anadarko common stock. This offer was about 20% more than the deal it had previously reached with Chevron.



The deal with Chevron will stand while negotiations with the biggest name in oil in the Permian basin Occidental continue, but the Chevron deal will likely to sidelined in favor of its more generous rival. Chevron, however, publicly announced its confidence that its bid would win out, according to CNN.Anadarko offers significant exposure to the coveted Permian basin, and will put an already heavy Permian player even more upfront.Anadarko posted a 7.2 percent drop in adjusted quarterly profit last week with adjusted net income of $259 million. Still, its sales volume of oil and natural gas (including natural gas liquids) was up year on year, averaging 715,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up from 643,000 this time last year.



Shares of Occidental were down 2.33% in late afternoon, while shares in Anadarko were trading up 0.21%.

Anadarko Petroleum Corporation said on Monday that it plans to resume negotiations with Occidental Petroleum after Occidental announced last week a proposal to buy Anadarko at a higher price than Anadarko had agreed in a deal with Chevron announced earlier this month.Chevron said on April 12 that it had entered into a definitive agreement to buy Anadarko in a stock and cash transaction valued at US$33 billion that would boost Chevron’s position in the Permian, the Gulf of Mexico, and in liquefied natural gas (LNG).Last Wednesday, Occidental Petroleum said that it is proposing to buy Anadarko at a higher price than the one Anadarko had accepted from Chevron, opening a bidding war for one of the U.S. companies with the strongest positions in the Permian.



Occidental Petroleum sent a letter to Anadarko’s board of directors on April 24, offering “a superior proposal” to buy Anadarko for $76.00 per share, in which Anadarko shareholders would receive $38.00 in cash and 0.6094 shares of Occidental common stock for each share of Anadarko common stock.The $76.00 per share cash-and-stock proposal from Occidental represents a premium of around 20 percent to the current value of the transaction with Chevron that Anadarko had accepted, Occidental said in a statement.Today, Anadarko said that it “is resuming its earlier negotiations with Occidental because Anadarko’s board of directors, following consultation with its financial and legal advisors, has unanimously determined that the Occidental Proposal could reasonably be expected to result in a ‘Superior Proposal' as defined in the Chevron Merger Agreement. The Occidental Proposal reflects significant improvement with respect to indicative value, terms and conditions, and closing certainty as compared to any previous proposal Occidental made to Anadarko.”



While negotiations are being held, the Chevron Merger Agreement “remains in effect and accordingly the Anadarko board reaffirms its existing recommendation of the transaction with Chevron at this time,” Anadarko said, noting that there is no guarantee that the talks would necessarily result in a superior transaction than the one pending with Chevron.

Natascha Engel, UK’s shale gas commissioner of six months has handed in her resignation, calling the earthquake rules adopted by the government “ridiculous” and an effective “ban on fracking.”The rules, according to a BBC report, stipulate a suspension of fracking activities if an earthquake with a magnitude of 0.5 on the Richter scale is detected. Engel, an ex-MP from the Labour Party, argues this is ""really ridiculously low."" She told the BBC it had been clear from the start that if this limit was not increased, fracking would struggle to take off.The now former top fracking officials also said the resignation had been prompted by the “terrible paralysis” the UK government had put itself into by taking the earthquake rules to an extreme.



""The profile of environmentalism has really been raised and I think the need to reduce our carbon emissions is absolutely urgent and fracking is absolutely one way we can do that,"" Engel also said, calling concerns about the effects of fracking on seismic activity “myths and scare stories.”“A perfectly viable industry is wasted because of a government policy driven by an environmental lobbying agenda rather than science, evidence and a desire to see U.K. industry to flourish,” Engel wrote in her resignation letter to the UK’s Business Minister, as quoted by Bloomberg.“The [0.5 magnitude] threshold might have had the veneer of wisdom if it were not for the 49 geoscientists who have called for a much higher limit. They are the experts. And yet they are ignored.”



Fracking is a highly controversial topic in the UK, with the governments of Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland all opposing the practice, awaiting further data about its environmental impact. In England, more than 100 fracking licenses have been awarded, but only one company, Cuadrilla, has received the final go-ahead from the authorities.Shale gas could be a game changer for the UK, whose offshore gas production is falling short of demand growth, but there is little chance attitudes to fracking are anywhere near changing as Engel’s move suggests.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Shocking Evidence Suggests Much Faster Global WarmingWhy An OPEC Oil Supply Surge Won’t HappenBig Oil’s Biggest Weapon In The Permian

The Libyan National Army led by General Khalifa Haftar launched air strikes on Tripoli during the weekend as it continues its offensive against the capital of Libya that’s controlled by the UN-recognized Government of National Accord, Reuters reports.Haftar's LNA is affiliated with the rival government in the east of the country.The escalation of violence in Libya came as a somewhat of a surprise after the LNA and other armed groups in the Oil Crescent clashed earlier this year over control of Libya’s oil export terminals. Now, according to the Reuters report, the LNA had sent a warship to one of the terminals, Ras Lanuf. All four export terminals are under the control of the LNA.



The National Oil Corporation condemned the move along with a few others, including an attempt to requisition several tug boats and the capturing of an airfield.“This illegal and irresponsible activity is a gross violation of our civilian mandate and must stop. These acts endanger workers, diminish partner confidence, and threaten our ability to maintain operations. NOC rejects all attempts to use corporation equipment and facilities for military objectives,” Reuters quoted NOC chairman Mustafa Sanalla as saying.Concern about the oil exports of Libya, on which the country relies almost exclusively for state revenues, has deepened in the three weeks since the LNA launched its offensive against Tripoli, after Haftar said Libya will soon have a single government.Related: Trump’s Offshore Drilling Boom May Not Happen Before 2020



For now, there have been no reports of falling oil production, but Turkey’s Anadolu Agency reported earlier today, citing a security source, that armed men had attacked Sharara, Libya’s largest oilfield. The attack, the source said, was unsuccessful and the LNA remained in control of the field.According to the head of the High Council of State, an advisory body, Haftar’s forces are receiving military equipment from Saudi Arabia and the UAE, including fighter jets. The UAE has also sent troops to fight alongside the LNA, Khaled al-Mishri said.The latest update from Tripoli is that the GNA forces are preparing to launch a counteroffensive against Haftar’s troops.

Neither OPEC Secretary General HE Mohammad Sanusi Barkindo nor Saudi officials have spoken with President Trump about lowering gasoline prices, according to Wall Street Journal sources, as cited by CNBC.President Donald Trump told reporters earlier in the day that he had “called up” OPEC, telling the group to move to reduce gasoline prices. It was unclear, however, whether the President was referring to a specific OPEC member or members, or whether he was referring to the group as a whole.



Saudi Arabia has already denied earlier in the week that there was a need to turn up the volume of oil it—and OPEC—produces, despite the end to sanction waivers that will now end on May 1.Oil prices fell sharply earlier on Friday, partially due to President Trump’s claim that he had directed OPEC to take action. Other negative headwinds for oil prices were unremarkable Q1 financial results from some Big Oil players including Chevron and Exxon Mobil.



Regardless of the reasons behind Friday’s negative price movement that saw both WTI and Brent shed roughly 3 percent by mid-afternoon, the direction of the prices will reduce the pressure played out in the media on OPEC to increase production to lower gasoline prices at the pump for American consumers.OPEC is currently overachieving on its commitment to remove the number of oil barrels from the market, and has room to increase production without altering their agreement which is set to be officially reviewed in June. OPEC+ members are split on their view about whether it will be necessary to extend the current agreement past June.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Why An OPEC Oil Supply Surge Won’t HappenBig Oil’s Biggest Weapon In The Permian‘’The Fat Margins Have Disappeared’’ - Big Oil Disappoints

U.S. supermajors ExxonMobil and Chevron reported on Friday lower Q1 earnings compared to a year ago, with profits squeezed by weak refining margins and volatile oil prices and Exxon badly missing on both earnings and revenues.Both supermajors, however, reported higher upstream production, driven by increased production at the Permian—the key growth region for both companies.Exxon posted earnings of US$2.4 billion for the first quarter of 2019, or US$0.55 per share assuming dilution—down by 50 percent compared to the first quarter of 2018 and down 61 percent from Q4 2018.The US$0.55 per share earnings fell well below the analyst estimate of US$0.70 earnings per share by the Wall Street Journal.



Exxon’s upstream liquids production increased by 5 percent compared with the first quarter of 2018, driven by a nearly 140-percent jump in Permian unconventional growth.However, downstream operations were hit by heavier refinery maintenance and “weak industry fuels margins from high gasoline inventory levels and narrowed North American crude differentials,” said Exxon, whose global downstream operations swung to a loss of US$256 million from a US$940-million profit in Q1 2018.“Solid operating performance in the first quarter helped mitigate the impact of challenging Downstream and Chemical margin environments,” said Darren W. Woods, chairman and chief executive officer.Earnings at Chevron also dropped due to weaker oil prices and weak refining and chemicals margins, but Chevron’s profit beat—albeit slightly—analyst estimates.



Chevron reported earnings of US$2.6 billion, or US$1.39 per share, for Q1 2019—down from US$3.6 billion, or US$1.90 per share in the first quarter of 2018—but still above the analyst estimate of US$1.30 per share. Chevron’s upstream production volumes increased by 7 percent annually, mostly due to the Permian and Wheatstone in Australia.“First quarter earnings declined from a year ago, largely due to lower crude oil prices and weaker downstream and chemicals margins,” Chevron’s chairman and CEO Michael Wirth said.After the release of the results, Exxon’s shares were down 2.85 percent while Chevron was down 1.52 percent at 2:01pm EDT on the NYSE on Friday.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Is This A Gamechanger For The Lithium Industry?A New Middle East Mega-War Is Unfolding Right Before Our EyesSaudi Arabia’s Dream Of $85 Oil Is Closer Than Ever

Trade unions have agreed to end a week-long strike at Europe’s largest oil refinery - Shell’s 404,000 bpd Pernis refinery in the Netherlands—after the parties resolved a dispute over wages that had seen the refinery operating at reduced rates since early April.The trade unions will advise workers to end the strike, CNV union spokesman Piet Verburg told Reuters on Friday.Shell has offered improved terms in the collective labor agreement and a wage rise of 3 percent this year, 2 percent next year, and 2.5 percent in 2021, a spokesman for the supermajor told Reuters on Thursday.“Shell has offered an improved and ultimate proposal for the Collective Labour Agreement (CLA) for Pernis and Moerdijk to the unions,” the spokesman said.



Unions had initially wanted a 5-percent wages increase, while Shell was offering a 2-percent raise this year and another 2.5-percent salary increase next year, according to earlier reports by Reuters.Oil products output at the refinery has been reduced after workers started the strike on April 8.At the end of last month, CNV said that workers would reduce production at the Pernis refinery and the Moerdijk chemical plant beginning on April 8 and would keep output at lower levels until workers’ demand are met.The union had given no indications of the amount of output reduction, but Pernis is the largest oil refinery in Europe, and the point is to reduce output to a level that would force Shell to meet demands for higher wages.



A day after the strike began, Shell said on April 9 that the industrial action had “a significant impact” on the refinery’s operations.A week later, unions were still at odds with Shell over pay rises and on April 16 the Dutch trade unions decided to extend the strike at least until Shell tables an offer that would re-open negotiations.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Trump’s Offshore Drilling Boom May Not Happen Before 2020This Country Will Be Critical For The Oil Industry’s FutureThe Slow Death Of Californian Oil & Gas

The Waorani people of the Amazon in Ecuador have renewed their vow to continue their fight to keep their ancestral land off limits for oil drilling, threatening to defend their jungle, spears and poisoned blowguns in hand, from oil companies and government plans to expand exploration areas for drilling in the rainforest.Ecuador plans to auction land in the Amazon for oil concessions, hoping to revive oil exploration and production and boost government revenues amid a sluggish economy.In the provincial capital Puyo, a judge is scheduled to rule on Friday if a legal challenge by the Waorani indigenous people against the government plans has merit, the AFP reports.Earlier this year, the Waorani people filed a lawsuit against the Ecuadorian Ministry of Energy and Non-Renewable Natural Resources, the Secretary of Hydrocarbons, and the Ministry of Environment, seeking to protect their lands from oil auctions.



Last year, Ecuador’s Minister of Hydrocarbons announced an auction of 16 new oil concessions covering nearly seven million acres of predominantly forest land in the territories of the Shuar, Achuar, Kichwa, Waorani, Shiwiar, Andoa, and Sápara nations.“The region is home to some of the highest levels of biodiversity on the planet,” says campaign group Amazon Frontlines, which supports the Waorani lawsuit.The lawsuit of the Waorani claims that their rights to free, prior, and informed consultation were violated because of an improper consultation process.  “Our fight is not just a fight about oil. This is a fight about different ways of living. One that protects life and one that destroys life,” says Nemonte Nenquimo, Waorani leader and President of CONCONAWEP (Coordinating Council of the Waorani Nationality of Ecuador-Pastaza).



“Our territory is not an oil block like the gov't sees it. Our territory is our life,” Waorani leader Oswando Nenquimo, says.“This watershed case is of great importance for the physical and cultural survival of the Waorani people and neighboring indigenous nations, and for the protection of millions of acres of highly biodiverse rainforest earmarked for oil drilling in the Ecuadorian Amazon,” Amazon Frontlines notes.

Russia is holding talks with Ukraine, Poland, and Belarus over a contamination of its crude oil that had Poland, Slovakia, Ukraine, and Belarus shut down their sections of the Druzhba pipeline earlier this week, Reuters reports. The discussion will focus on the removal of tainted oil from the pipeline.The problem has strained relations between Moscow and Minsk as Belarus was the first to report the problematic oil last week, warning that it could damage refinery equipment. The oil was contaminated with organic chlorine, a substance used in oil production to boost output but dangerous in high amounts for refining equipment. The amounts of the chemical were found to be at levels much higher than the maximum allowable amount.A TASS report from yesterday quoted Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Kozak as saying that Belarus would be provided with clean oil on Monday, adding that “A considerable portion of poor quality oil has already been evacuated to tanks in the territory of Russia.”



The official also said, ""The issue of compensation has not been raised so far. The issue was put forward regarding the need to increase indicative balances for oil product supplies to the domestic market. Discussion is in progress.""Though a rare occurrence, oil contamination could have longer-lasting effects on European refineries as not all of them have enough oil in storage to keep operating as usual. Germany’s refining industry is fine for the time being with ample supplies, but Polish refiners could face some challenges in finding alternative crude oil supplies.The Druzhba pipeline that runs from Russia to Germany with branches into countries along the way has the capacity to transport up to 1 million barrels of crude daily. Yet the contamination has also been found in tanker cargoes loaded at the Ust Luga port.



According to Reuters trading sources, at least five vessels belonging to Rosneft, Surgutneftegaz, and Kazakh companies have set sail from the terminal with contaminated cargo. The buyers of the cargoes include Total, Trafigura, Vitol, and Equinor.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:This Country Will Be Critical For The Oil Industry’s FutureThe Slow Death Of Californian Oil & GasTrump’s Removal Of This 100-Year Old Law Is Good News For Natural Gas

Australia has joined the growing list of U.S. crude oil importers with two tankers currently en route to Down Under with cargoes of light U.S. crude, Reuters reports, citing sources from the commodity trading industry and shipping data.“Australia’s aging refineries were designed to run regional crude that is typically light and sweet. U.S. crude is a good substitute for typical Australian refinery feedstock,” a Reuters Refinitiv analyst explained. The bulk of U.S. crude oil output is exactly this sort of crude.Lower freight rates have also helped more U.S. crude reach foreign markets, and as a result of this combination of favorable factors, total U.S. shipments of crude oil to Asia alone could reach 38.1 million barrels in May, according to Reuters calculations. This equals 1.2 million bpd.



However, going forward, shipments could begin declining as the discount of West Texas Intermediate and grades based on this benchmark to Brent crude narrows.The spread between the two benchmarks used to be so wide it stimulated greater appetite for Gulf Coast grades of crude, Reuters reported yesterday. Yet now, the rally that followed Washington’s announcement that there would be no more Iran sanction waivers for oil importers beginning in May has changed the price dynamic, pushing Gulf Coast grades higher.“The arb (arbitrage) is only barely open and has been closed to the East regularly over the past few weeks,” one U.S. oil industry source told Reuters. At the same time, another source said that China is getting more interested in U.S. crude after the removal of the waivers, even though it has officially complained about the move to Washington.

The value of exports of oil and gas from Texas jumped by 45 percent, CNBC reports, citing data from trade research firm WISERTrade.The value of Texas’ petroleum and coal product exports increased by 5 percent.The value of Texas exports in January and February this year exceeded US$50.9 billion, a rise of 9 percent on the year—triple the U.S. national export growth of 2.6 percent in the first two months of the year, according to WISERTrade data.



As per WISERTrade, Texas accounted for almost 20 percent of all U.S. exports in the first two months of 2019, compared to 11 percent share for California. Over the past few years, the share of California of national exports has declined, while the share of Texas has grown, thanks to the soaring production and the rise in exports from the U.S. Gulf Coast after the U.S. removed restrictions on crude oil exports in 2015.According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the value of the Texas crude oil exports stood at US$38.675 billion in 2018, a surge of 127 percent from 2017.Texas continues to see its exports climb, and the state “exhibits a manufacturing edge in energy-related products and intermediate goods,” Jesus Cañas and Stephanie Gullo with the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas wrote earlier this month.



Texas’ annualized 6 percent export growth since 2002 is almost double the 3.6 percent rate for the rest of the United States, according to Dallas Fed.Last year, petroleum and coal products was the number-one manufacturing export sector for Texas, accounting for 17.7 percent of total state exports, the Dallas Fed said, but warned that its Texas business survey from February 2019 found that businesses described the tariffs as “a looming threat” affecting “virtually all imported raw materials” and “making U.S. exports less competitive.”   By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Iraqi Oil Industry Takes A Critical TurnWhy Goldman Sachs Believes Oil Won’t Go HigherThe Firm Floor Under Oil Prices

Some Californians will soon see a new 1% fee added to their restaurant check as the Restore California Renewable Restaurants look to help fight climate change by offsetting the carbon footprint of going out to eat.The fee, to be optionally added to restaurant bills at the restaurant’s discretion, will be spent on carbon plans for farms and ranches.



Restaurant patrons would still have the option to not pay the 1% fee, but would have to ask to have it removed from their bill. For the remainder of the population who are either too sheepish to admit they are unwilling to help pay for the measures that would help farmers ……., they would have the “opportunity for eaters and buyers to share in land-based solutions,” California Food and Agriculture Secretary Karen Ross said in a statement to San Francisco Chronicle.The money under the program, referred to as “Restore California”, will be collected by the California Air Resources Board and used according to the Perennial Farming Initiative (PFI), whose mission is to “foster a renewable food system rooted in healthy soil”.

Saudi Arabia’s oil giant Aramco, which has an ambitious plan to grow its natural gas business, is in talks with many partners for a potential joint venture or partnership, in order to grow its international gas position, Saudi Aramco’s chief executive Amin Nasser said on Thursday.“For the time being we are looking at potential JV or partnership,” Reuters quoted Nasser as saying in Riyadh today.Aramco has already sold its first liquefied natural gas (LNG) cargo from Singapore, the firm’s chief executive added. 



In January this year, Nasser told Reuters in an interview that the oil firm was looking to spend billions of U.S. dollars on natural gas acquisitions in the United States as part of Aramco’s strategy to bolster its gas business and become a global natural gas player.At the end of February, Nasser said that Saudi Arabia aims to export as much as 3 billion cubic feet of gas per day by 2030 as part of its goal to boost the international footprint of its natural gas business.Aramco will solely develop Saudi Arabia’s conventional and unconventional gas reserves, and the options for exports include exports via pipelines and LNG, according to Aramco’s top manager.



In November 2018, Nasser said that Aramco, already a top global oil producer but not as strong in gas production, will boost efforts to grow its natural gas output, from both conventional and unconventional reserves.Saudi Aramco’s gas development program is expected to attract as much as US$150 billion in investments over the next decade, Nasser said. Natural gas production is expected to jump to 23 billion standard cubic feet a day from the current 14 billion cubic feet a day, Aramco’s top executive said in Dubai a few months ago.“We also have world-class unconventional gas resources that are rapidly supplementing our large conventional resources. Because a significant proportion of this unconventional gas is rich in both liquids and ethane, its production will play an important role in the further growth of the Kingdom’s chemicals sector,” Nasser said.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Is This A Gamechanger For The Lithium Industry?A New Middle East Mega-War Is Unfolding Right Before Our EyesSaudi Arabia’s Dream Of $85 Oil Is Closer Than Ever

 Russian gas producer Novatek said on Thursday that it had signed agreements with two Chinese companies, under which the Asian firms will become shareholders in the Arctic LNG project with 10 percent each.Novatek, the largest Russian producer and exporter of liquefied natural gas (LNG), signed an agreement with CNOOC and another deal with China National Oil and Gas Exploration and Development Company (CNODC), a wholly owned subsidiary of China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC). CNOOC and CNODC will enter the Arctic LNG project with a 10-percent participation interest each.“We are very glad that CNOOC has joined our Arctic LNG 2 project as our new partner, since China represents one of the key consuming markets for our LNG sales,” Leonid Mikhelson, Novatek’s Chairman of the Management Board, said in a statement.“Arctic LNG 2 will be a game-changer in the global gas market, and our proven track record to successfully build an LNG facility in the Arctic zone, combined with a proven logistical model with access to prospective markets and large hydrocarbon resource base will ensure the successful implementation of this world class project,” according to Mikhelson.Earlier this year, France’s Total, a partner of Novatek in the producing Yamal LNG project, signed a deal to buy a direct 10-percent interest in Arctic LNG 2. The project’s final investment decision (FDI) is expected to be made in the second half of 2019, with plans to start up the first liquefaction train in 2023, according to the French oil and gas major.Related: Chevron And Occidental Start Bidding War For AnadarkoEarlier this month, Novatek signed a preliminary agreement with Vitol for supply from Arctic LNG.“We commenced contracting LNG volumes from our new project Arctic LNG 2,” Novatek’s First Deputy Chairman of the Management Board, Lev Feodosyev, said in early April, adding that “LNG volumes sold at our transshipment terminals ensures the flexibility of LNG supplies around the world and allows us to create LNG hubs in the Asia-Pacific and Atlantic basins.”While keeping a grip on the European gas market, Russia looks to boost LNG deliveries to the growing Asian market with storage hubs close to end-users to reduce freight costs and increase flexibility in deliveries.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Survey: Canada’s Government To Blame For Oil CrisisA New Middle East Mega-War Is Unfolding Right Before Our EyesSaudi Arabia’s Dream Of $85 Oil Is Closer Than Ever

Canada announced on Thursday that it is banning oil and gas drilling in federal marine protected areas, in a move to take action to protect the oceans.Until now, Canada would review and assess whether to allow economic activities in marine protected areas on a case-by-case basis. Under the new standards for conservation and protection of the oceans, Canada will now have a total ban on oil and gas activities, mining, dumping, and bottom trawling in marine protected areas.The Canadian Ministry of Fisheries and Oceans has applied recommendations that an independent National Advisory Panel issued in a report in September last year.



With regard to other forms of conservation measures such as marine refuges, economic activities in those areas will continue to be assessed on a case-by-case basis.Such activities will be allowed if they are consistent with the conservation objectives of a specific marine refuge area, and proposed industrial activities in marine refuges will continue to be subject to Canada’s environmental assessment rules, the Ministry of Fisheries and Oceans said.“Canadians expect us to take action to protect unique ocean ecosystems while ensuring coastal communities thrive. The new standards for marine conservation we are announcing today will provide for high levels of environmental protection in a manner that is sensitive to important economic actors such as fish harvesters,” said Jonathan Wilkinson, Minister of Fisheries, Oceans and the Canadian Coast Guard.



Canada has a goal to achieve its international marine conservation target to have 10 percent of its ocean and coastal territories protected by 2020. Today’s announcement brings Canada’s protected ocean areas to 8.27 percent.“This important first step in protecting critical habitats will give marine species safe havens that are free of seismic blasting and drilling,” Megan Leslie, WWF-Canada president and CEO, said in a statement, commenting on the Canadian government’s announcement.

Massive blackouts in Venezuela in March and April have drastically reduced oil production at Chevron’s biggest oil joint venture in the country, Bloomberg reported on Thursday, citing data that it had compiled from company sources.Chevron holds a 30-percent stake in Petropiar, a joint venture with PDVSA in Venezuela’s Orinoco Belt operated by the Venezuelan state oil firm. The project processes extra heavy crude oil from the Huyapari field and upgrades it to a lighter, higher-value synthetic oil.Due to the numerous blackouts and the rationing of electricity in the Orinoco Belt over the past two months, Petropiar’s production averaged 74,000 bpd in the first two weeks of April, which was 44 percent below the average production in the first two weeks of January.



Petropiar has historically been one of the top producing projects in Venezuela and has a capacity of 190,000 bpd. The Chevron venture produced an average 132,000 bpd in January, but after the blackouts began in early March, production has drastically dropped and was even entirely offline for two days in a row, according to the data compiled by Bloomberg.PDVSA expects a sharp decline in oil production in April, with the four upgraders operating in joint ventures with international majors running a lot lower than capacity, Reuters reported earlier this month, citing company documents and sources close to the company.A string of blackouts in the last few weeks have caused extended outages at crucial oil facilities including the upgraders, which have a combined capacity of 700,000 bpd.



On top of the massive blackouts, Venezuela’s oil industry suffered in the past two months from the U.S. sanctions, the continued economic crisis, and the chronic underinvestment in its oil facilities.Venezuela, one of OPEC’s members exempt from the ongoing production cuts, contributed inadvertently to the cartel’s mission to reduce global oil supply last month. Venezuela’s crude oil production plunged by 289,000 bpd from February to below 1 million bpd—to 732,000 bpd in March, according to OPEC’s secondary sources.

The central Iraqi government will meet with its Kurdish counterparts soon to talk about oil exports from the now semi-autonomous region that tried to gain independence last year.Reuters reported, citing Iraq’s oil minister, Thamer Ghadhban, that the two sides will also discuss the increase of oil production from the fields around the northern city of Kirkuk by as much as 50 percent.The fields around Kirkuk, as well as the city itself, were until the fall of 2017 under the control of the Kurdish government, although the area was not officially part of the Kurdistan region. However, after the ill-fated independence referendum, which led to a strong reaction from Baghdad, the central Iraqi authorities regained control of the oil fields that account for a sizeable portion of Iraq’s oil total.



Around 300,000 bpd of crude oil previously pumped and exported in the Kirkuk province to the Turkish port of Ceyhan were shut in when the Iraqi federal government moved in October 2017 to take control over the oil fields in Kirkuk from Kurdish forces after the semi-autonomous region held a referendum that Baghdad didn’t recognize.However, the only export outlet of the Kirkuk oil is the oil pipeline of the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG). The Iraqi federal government and the KRG had been in talks for months to try to reach an agreement on resuming Iraqi exports from Kirkuk. Iraq only resumed oil exports from the Kirkuk province a year after it had stopped the oil flows.In separate but related news, Thamer Ghadhban said the country had enough oil production capacity to boost output to as much as 6 million bpd if need be, although right now he did not see a pressing need for more OPEC production despite the removal of U.S. sanction waivers for Iranian oil importers.

Tesla may soon announce a capital raise after Elon Musk suggested “There is some merit to raising capital,” adding “It’s probably about the right time,” as quoted by Reuters. The comments by Tesla’s CEO followed the release of the company’s first-quarter results yesterday.The EV maker reported a net loss of US$702 million as well as a US$1.5-billion decline in cash and cash equivalents, to US$2.2 billion. What’s more, Model 3 production only inched up by 3 percent during the quarter, to 63,000, which must have disappointed shareholders eager to see the strong growth in production promised by the company.Going forward, Musk once again revised down production targets: the gigafactory in Shanghai, currently in construction, would produce an average 1,000 or maybe 2,000 Model 3s weekly this year, rather than the 3,000 expected earlier.Overall, however, Tesla kept its production forecasts for the year unchanged at 360,000 to 400,000. A production rate of 500,000 cars is also a possibility in case the Chinese factory achieves volume production in the last quarter of the year.As for the next financial results of the company, this quarter’s loss will be a lot lower than the one for the first quarter, and in the third quarter the carmaker will return to the black. The need for a capital raise, however, may worry investors, whose lives have been kept interesting by Musk and company without a doubt.The latest reason to worry came earlier this month, when one of the company’s largest shareholders, T. Rowe Price, cut its the stake he holds in Tesla via several funds sparking concern in the market. Between September and December last year, the funds reduced their holding in the EV maker from 10.2 percent to 5.2 percent. The cutting continued in 2019 as well: according to Reuters Refinitiv data, the asset manager divested 92 percent of its previous interest in Tesla.By Irina Slav via Safehaven.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Why Goldman Sachs Believes Oil Won’t Go HigherThe Firm Floor Under Oil PricesSaudi Arabia, Iraq Prepared To Reverse Oil Production Cuts

The U.S. sanctions imposed last November on Iran have denied the country some US$10 billion in oil revenues so far, Washington’s Special Envoy for Iran Brian Hook told media.The comments were made days after Washington announced the end to sanction waivers that it had granted eight large Iranian oil importers, among them India, China, Japan, and South Korea.“Before sanctions...Iran generated as much as $50 billion annually in oil revenue. We estimate that our sanctions have already denied the regime more than $10 billion since May,” Hook said, referring to May 2018 when President Trump said the sanctions would be returning later in 2018.



According to Reuters, before the sanctions—and after the UN-approved sanctions were removed thanks to the so-called nuclear deal—Iran exported some 4 million bpd of crude, which made it one of the largest producers in OPEC. Now, export data suggests, the country is exporting about 1 million bpd.Related:  Saudi Arabia’s Dream Of $85 Oil Is Closer Than EverSaudi Arabia and the UAE, as well as Iraq, have stated they would be ready to step in and fill the gap left by Iranian crude oil after the end of waivers next week but China, for one, has signaled that it will not respect the end of the waivers. Unlike others, China has been vocal in its opposition to the removal of the waivers while India has stated it would look to other suppliers to compensate for the cutoff of Iranian oil. South Korea and Japan do not expect any major negative impact from the cancelation of the waivers.Despite Washington’s determination to completely stop the flow of oil from Iran to foreign markets, few believe the zero-export target is achievable. If anything, it would spur more smuggling, some observers believe. What it will undoubtedly do, however, is keep prices higher, closer to where Saudi Arabia and other OPEC producers would like them to be, in stark contrast to what voting drivers in the U.S. want.



It’s no coincidence that after its initial declaration of support and readiness to reverse production cuts, Saudi Arabia noted it would not rush into a reversal of the cuts but would rather first wait and see what happens in Iran.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Saudi Oil Minister: We Won’t Ramp Up Oil Production SoonA New Middle East Mega-War Is Unfolding Right Before Our EyesSaudi Arabia’s Dream Of $85 Oil Is Closer Than Ever

Poland has shut down the flow of Russian crude oil via the Druzhba pipeline after traces of contamination were found, Reuters reports. An earlier report that Germany had also stopped taking in Russian crude because of the contamination was refuted by the German oil industry association, which said it had not yet encountered problems with oil quality.The oil was contaminated with organic chlorine, and apparently originated with a Russian oil producer that remained unnamed at the time of writing. The amounts of the chemical were found to be at levels much higher than the maximum allowable amount, with refiners risking damage to their equipment.Reuters quoted European traders as saying the oil contained as much as 150-330 parts per million of the output-boosting chemical, when the maximum safe amount was 10 ppm. The usual level of organic chloride in crude is between 1 and 3 parts per million.



Russia has said that Transneft, the oil pipeline monopoly in Russia, is working to fix the problem. In the meantime, Russian government officials are meeting urgently to discuss the problem, unnamed sources told Reuters.The Druzhba pipeline that runs from Russia to Germany with branches into countries along the way has the capacity to transport up to 1 million barrels of crude daily. Yet the contamination has also been found in tanker cargoes loaded at the Ust Luga port.According to Reuters trading sources, at least five vessels belonging to Rosneft, Surgutneftegaz, and Kazakh companies, have set sail from the terminal with contaminated cargo. The buyers of the cargoes include Total, Trafigura, Vitol, and Equinor.



“No one wants to stop the refineries in Germany. They will be operating at lower capacity now and may import some crude from the sea,” one of the sources said.This is the first time in about ten years that Russia crude was found to be contaminated with organic chloride.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Is This A Gamechanger For The Lithium Industry?A New Middle East Mega-War Is Unfolding Right Before Our EyesSaudi Arabia’s Dream Of $85 Oil Is Closer Than Ever

Nigerian firm Aiteo Oil Exploration and Production Company, has discovered that sabotage was the cause of the fire that caused Nigeria’s oil production to fall 8% per day, creating a force majeure. All six saboteurs, The Joint Military Task Force said on Wednesday, had been killed in the blaze.The Nembe Creek Trunk Line, with a capacity of 150,000 barrels per day, was shuttered following the fire that has now been linked back. The pipeline carries oil from the eastern Niger Delta to the Bonny Export Terminal.This is the second shutdown of the pipeline in as many months, after an explosion from a well head in Nembe Creek resulted in a separate fire.



Aiteo said it had repaired the breach, but did not disclose whether the oil was flowing again at normal rates.Despite the force majeure which remains in effect, preliminary loading programs showed on Wednesday that four major Nigerian crude oil grades will see an uptick in exports in June, according to Reuters. The largest increase will come from its Forcados grade, which will see June loadings of 230,000 bpd, up from 127,000 bpd in May.In total, Reuters data shows, the four Nigerian grades will see a 155,000 barrel-per-day export increase in June over May.



Nigeria has had a long and painful history with militants disrupting the country’s oil flows, but recent months has seen relatively stability in production levels between 1.723 and 1.733 million barrels per day, according to OPEC’s Monthly Oil Market Report.The production stability for the African nation this year comes as its breakeven costs fell to just US$23 per barrel, according to Nigerian Petroleum Minister Emmanuel Ibe Kachikwu, who added that the goal is to reduce this per barrel cost further to US$15 per barrel.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads from Oilprice.com:Saudi Oil Minister: We Won’t Ramp Up Oil Production SoonThe Firm Floor Under Oil PricesSaudi Arabia, Iraq Prepared To Reverse Oil Production Cuts

Disputed Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has publicly criticized the “theft” of its state-owned and US-based refining operations, Citgo, in a radio broadcast on Tuesday, adding that those responsible of this “crime” will be tried in court, after which the refining arm would be returned to its rightful owner, PDVSA.While the United States—complicit in this theft, according to Maduro—is unlikely to see retribution in any way over handling of Citgo, opposition leader Juan Guaido and his followers could possibly run afoul of Venezuelan courts.



The United States officially recognized Guaido as the rightful president of Venezuela, much to the chagrin of his adversary, Nicolas Maduro.This week’s allegations that PDVSA has been robbed of its Citgo refinery are nothing new; Maduro has long held that the United States wanted nothing more than to steal Citgo from its rightful owners, saying in January of this year that PDVSA “would take legal, political, operational and commercial measures to defend Venezuela’s interests in the United States.”



While the rhetoric remains nearly the same, Venezuela’s situation is growing increasingly dire as Maduro tries to hold onto power and keep his country financially afloat in the wake of the sanctions and repeated blackouts that have restricted its oil production and exports that fell below 1 million barrels per day last month.The tug of war between Maduro and Guaido is now manifesting itself in PDVSA finances, with Guaido now desperately trying to make good on PDVSA’s bond payment of $71 million without having official authority to do so. The opposition-led board of PDVSA will vote next Tuesday on the matter—a critical development as this bond is backed by Citgo assets.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Iraqi Oil Industry Takes A Critical TurnSaudi Oil Minister: We Won’t Ramp Up Oil Production SoonChevron And Occidental Start Bidding War For Anadarko

Per shareholder prodding, Equinor will review its existing climate targets through 2030, and will come up with new ones for 2030 and beyond, and will tie executive and employee renumeration to achieving those goals.Norway’s oil firm Equinor is the latest oil major to act on shareholder concerns about the impact that its operations have on the climate.Equinor has also agreed to report on its estimated carbon intensity of its products and services, and even more drastically, will ensure that all capital investments line up with the goal of keeping global temperature increases to 2°C.



Equinor, formerly Statoil, began its campaign to be seen as something other than an oil company last year, putting distance between itself and oil when it announced that it would change its name in favor of a more energy neutral moniker.Spearheading the most recent change were a group of 320 investors, Reuters said on Wednesday, led by a global group of heavy hitters managing $33 trillion in combined assets.But shareholders didn’t get everything that they wanted. Equinor’s board is set to vote on May 15 on a shareholder resolution that would see Equinor compelled to set reduction targets for Scope 3 emissions—basically all indirect emissions. However, the board is recommending a vote against that measure, to the ire of activists.



Today’s announcement follows a string of shareholder strongarming when it comes to Big Oil and climate change. Exxon Mobil Shell, BP, and Occidental have all been targets, some successful.Exxon Mobil, however, emerged victorious earlier this month when the SEC ruled in favor of Exxon over a shareholder request to disclose targets to reduce emissions in line with the 2015 Paris climate agreement.But Big Oil isn’t finished just yet. President Trump earlier this month ordered a review of the laws that essentially allow shareholders to chime in over climate issues.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:The Firm Floor Under Oil PricesSaudi Arabia, Iraq Prepared To Reverse Oil Production CutsChevron And Occidental Start Bidding War For Anadarko

Ford Motor Company is investing US$500 million in Rivian, an electric vehicle (EV) developer which is considered to be a potential future rival to Tesla.Ford, one of Detroit’s Big Three, and Rivian announced on Wednesday an equity investment of US$500 million from Ford in Rivian, forming a strategic partnership.Rivian will remain an independent company after Ford’s investment, which is subject to customary regulatory approval. Following the investment, Joe Hinrichs, Ford’s president of Automotive, will join Rivian’s seven-member board.Apart from Ford’s investment, the companies have agreed to work together to develop an all-new, next-generation battery electric vehicle for Ford’s growing EV portfolio using Rivian’s skateboard platform.



This new vehicle comes on top of Ford’s plans to develop a portfolio of battery electric vehicles.Ford has already announced it would invest US$11 billion in EVs. As part of that multi-billion investment, the company has confirmed it would roll out two key fully electric vehicles: a crossover inspired by the Mustang in 2020 and a zero-emissions version of the best-selling F-150 pickup.“As we continue in our transformation of Ford with new forms of intelligent vehicles and propulsion, this partnership with Rivian brings a fresh approach to both,” Jim Hackett, Ford president and CEO, said in a statement.“At the same time, we believe Rivian can benefit from Ford’s industrial expertise and resources,” Hackett noted.



“Ford has a long-standing commitment to sustainability, with Bill Ford being one of the industry’s earliest advocates, and we are excited to use our technology to get more electric vehicles on the road,” said RJ Scaringe, Rivian founder and CEO.Rivian, whose target group is adventurers, has developed two clean-sheet vehicles: the five-passenger R1T pickup and the seven-passenger R1S SUV. Rivian plans to launch both vehicles in the U.S. in late 2020, and to start adding other countries beginning in 2021.   By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Iraqi Oil Industry Takes A Critical TurnChevron And Occidental Start Bidding War For AnadarkoSaudi Oil Minister: We Won’t Ramp Up Oil Production Soon

Cenovus Energy, the first major Canadian oil firm to report Q1 figures and one of the early proponents of a production curtailment in Alberta, said on Wednesday that the mandatory cuts are working and benefiting both the industry and the province, thanks to increased Canadian oil prices.“It should now be crystal clear that the government’s temporary curtailment program is doing what it was intended to do and has had an immediate, positive impact not only for our industry, but for all Albertans, in the form of improved royalty revenue,” Alex Pourbaix, Cenovuspresident and chief executive officer, said in the company’s Q1 results release today.Pourbaix was one of the first Canadian oil managers to call for cuts from all companies.



“I remain convinced that this curtailment is the right thing for our industry and for Albertans,” Pourbaix said on the Q4 earnings call in mid-February.“Ultimately people need to keep in mind that this has been a short-term solution for an extreme situation that was many years in the making,” he said two months ago.In the Q1 earnings release on Wednesday, Cenovus said that the after the cuts were implemented the spread between WTI and Western Canadian Select (WCS) narrowed to an average of US$12.37 a barrel in Q1, with the price of WCS up to an average of US$42.53 a barrel, more than double the average price in Q4 2018 and up 10 percent from Q1 2018. Related: Why The Argentinian Shale Boom Isn’t Taking Off“The significant improvement in WCS pricing resulting from the government’s mandatory curtailment program more than offset the impact of reduced oil production and increased oil sands operating costs during the first quarter,” Cenovus said.



The company revised down by 7 percent its production guidance for full-2019 “to reflect the anticipated impact of curtailment.” Cenovus now sees its total oil sands production averaging 350,000 bpd-370,000 bpd this year.While pro-curtailment Cenovus praised Alberta’s drastic policy, other producers—including Imperial Oil, Suncor Energy, and Husky Energy—have yet to report Q1 figures and take stock of the mandatory production cuts.These three companies have repeatedly said the Alberta government has been wrong to intervene in the free market, and has created an additional layer of uncertainty and unpredictability of the business and investment climate in Canada’s oil industry.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Iraqi Oil Industry Takes A Critical TurnOil Falls On Rising Crude InventoriesSaudi Oil Minister: We Won’t Ramp Up Oil Production Soon

The future of Algeria’s energy industry just got a little more murky as the interim president of the country fired the chief executive of Sonatrach and replaced him with the executive hitherto in charge of exploration and production.The former chief executive, Abdelmoumene Ould Kaddour, had been part of long-time Algerian president Abdelaziz Bouteflika’s circle, who earlier this month stepped down amid intensifying protests insisting on a government change. The replacement, Reuters note, was promoted by Kaddour.



According to analysts quoted by Reuters, the change at the helm of Algeria’s energy company did not have anything to do with how Kaddour ran the company. It had all to do with his closeness to the ally circle of the former Algerian president.Even so, the chances of foreign companies flocking back to Algeria are slim until the situation becomes clearer. Exxon, BP, and Equinor have all put the brakes on their investment plans for the North African country amid the escalating protests in the last couple of months. Exxon was about to sign a preliminary deal for a trading joint venture with Sonatrach in the next few months. BP has a long presence in the country, and so does Norway’s Equinor, and both had new investment intentions that may now be put on hold.



Algeria produces around 1.1 million bpd of crude oil, which makes its output comparable to Libya’s. Oil reserves are estimated at 12 billion barrels. Yet it is also a major natural gas producer and home to the third-largest shale gas reserves in the world, at 20 trillion cu ft, according to U.S. government data. Production was around 94.78 billion cubic meters for 2017, of which 53.89 billion cubic meters was exported.

The federal government of Canada will announce its final decision on the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project in mid-June, Finance Minister Marc Garneau told media. Interestingly, the decision may be to drop the project altogether, which was in the cards when the government bought the project from exasperated Kinder Morgan.When Ottawa bought the Trans Mountain expansion from TransCanada last year, it planned to look for buyers to pass it on to and have it completed. Since then, opponents of the project have stepped up the pressure and challenged the project at the Federal Court of Appeal.



When asked what the most likely decision was, the federal Finance Minister said, as quoted by The Province, “I am not going to prejudge the outcome of that decision. We’re focused on having all of the work done to enable us to make a decision based on having done our homework and satisfying the Federal Court of Appeal.”The controversial project pitted against each other two provinces—Alberta and British Columbia—and also about a dozen First nations, some of them strongly opposing the project and others willing to buy it. The former took their case to the appeals court. The latter last month discussed an acquisition with the federal government, including Morneau.



Currently, the federal government is conducting consultations with First Nations regarding the project, evidently in an attempt to address all possible concerns that opponents may have. Should the outcome of the consultations be positive, work on the project could start fairly quickly, the business entity in charge of the expansion said.The federal government of Canada last year bought the Trans Mountain expansion project from Kinder Morgan for US$3.4 billion (C$4.5 billion) when the latter said it was reluctant to pursue the project in the face of too many delays and strong opposition from environmentalists and the new government of British Columbia. It then said it would seek other buyers for the project to carry it out.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Saudi Oil Minister: We Won’t Ramp Up Oil Production SoonWhy Gasoline Prices Could Be About To RocketWhy Goldman Sachs Believes Oil Won’t Go Higher

OPEC’s spare capacity has reached 3.3 million barrels per day, according to an International Energy Agency (IEA) statement on the global oil markets released on Tuesday.“As a result of OPEC’s high compliance rate with the agreed supply cuts in the OPEC+ group, global spare production capacity has risen to 3.3 mb/d, with 2.2 mb/d held by Saudi Arabia and around 1 mb/d by the United Arab Emirates, Iraq and Kuwait,” the IEA said in its release as oil prices reached new 2019 highs.The Brent and WTI benchmarks were both trading up on Tuesday following the news that the United States would not extend Iran sanction waivers to purchasers of Iranian crude oil, leaving the original May 1 cutoff date firm.



The global oil markets are now adequately supplied, the IEA said, with plenty of spare capacity to make up for any gaps in oil supplies.Iran’s April oil exports of 1.1 million barrels per day were already lower than in March. With spare capacity of 2.2 million barrels per day in Saudi Arabia, OPEC should theoretically be able to comfortably lift production to compensate for lost Iranian barrels, with Saudi Arabia currently pumping about a million less than in November 2018.The IEA cautioned, however, that global economic growth is still fragile, and urged oil consumers and producers to “take steps to avoid higher oil prices that will prove painful to all alike.”



Global OECD oil inventories, too, are above the five-year average at 2,871 million barrels, according to the IEA. The API is due to release US crude oil inventory figures today at 4:30pm EST—a highly watched metric that traders use to assess the condition of the oil markets.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Trump’s Iran Decision Could Kill The OPEC+ DealWhy Goldman Sachs Believes Oil Won’t Go HigherTrump’s Hardline On Iran Catches Markets Off-Guard

The American Petroleum Institute (API) reported a build in crude oil inventory of 6.86 million barrels for the week ending April 19, coming in over analyst expectations of a 167,000-barrel drawdown.Last week, the API reported a draw in crude oil of 3.096 million barrels.A day later, the EIA confirmed the draw with a report of a 1.4-million-barrel drop in inventory. Including this week’s data, the net build is now 11.30 million barrels for the 17-week reporting period so far this year, using API data.

Oil prices ticked higher on Tuesday as the United States announced that it would not be extending any of the waivers that it had previously granted purchasers of Iranian oil.WTI was trading up on Tuesday before the data release at $66.15, up $0.60 (+0.92%) on the day at 1:03pm, also up week on week by more than $2 per barrel. The Brent benchmark was also trading up on the day at $74.21, up $0.17 (+0.23%) at that time. The Brent benchmark was up week on week by almost $3 per barrel.The API this week reported a draw in gasoline inventories as well for week ending April 19 in the amount of 1.82 million barrels. Analysts estimated a draw in gasoline inventories of 333,000 barrels for the week.Despite the bearish crude and gasoline builds, the API did, however, report a small draw to the amount of 865,000 barrels, largely in line with analyst predictions of 712,000 barrels.The Cushing storage hub in Oklahoma saw a draw of almost 390,000 barrels according to the API.US crude oil production as estimated by the Energy Information Administration showed that production for the week ending April 12—the latest information available—came in just off its all-time high, at 12.1 million bpd.The U.S. Energy Information Administration report on crude oil inventories is due to be released on Wednesday at 10:30a.m. EST.By 4:42pm EST, WTI was trading up at $66.33 and Brent was trading up at $74.50.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.com More Top Reads From Oilprice.com:The ‘CIA Man’ In Libya Securing Oil SupplyThe Firm Floor Under Oil PricesSaudi Arabia, Iraq Prepared To Reverse Oil Production Cuts

Mock headstones for President Vladimir Putin are the latest signal that Russian citizens are unhappy with this year’s tax hikes, according to Meduza,, with Putin’s polling numbers taking a hit.The tax hikes, however, are offset somewhat by Russia calling on its oil companies to hold fuel prices steady to insulate its people from the high price of fuels. But in addition to the tax hikes, the government has also agreed to pay the oil companies back for doing so—compensating them for 60 percent of the difference between European fuel prices and Russian fuel prices.



Of course, lower fuel prices are usually welcomed by the masses, but to make this happen, Russia is unleashing $8 billion from its sovereign wealth fund and giving it to the oil companies—oil companies that have enjoyed a rather flush year. And it is this part of the arrangement that has stoked controversy in the country.Russia’s sovereign wealth fund, which currently sits at almost $60 billion according to Reuters, was funded largely on the backs of these oil companies; a fiscal rule requires that Russian oil revenues stemming from anything above $40 per barrel be stashed in this wealth fund. But it was also designed to insulate the country from geopolitical turmoil and economically hard times that may arise in future years, for future generations.



The interesting turn of events that created the need to hold fuel prices steady stemmed largely from higher oil prices in the last year—higher oil prices that Russia is partially responsible for as it continues to cooperate with OPEC to curtail production.The production cuts, however, did little to tarnish the bottom line of the Russian oil giants. Rosneft’s 2018 full year revenue was up 37 percent. Lukoil’s revenue was up over 35 percent.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:The ‘CIA Man’ In Libya Securing Oil SupplyThe Firm Floor Under Oil PricesSaudi Arabia, Iraq Prepared To Reverse Oil Production Cuts

Apache Corporation said on Tuesday that it had temporarily started to delay natural gas production at its Alpine High play in the Permian in late March to mitigate the impact of the extremely low prices at the Waha hub in West Texas.Currently, the company is deferring around 250 million cubic feet (MMcf) per day of gross gas production.Natural gas prices at the Waha hub plummeted to record low negative levels in early April, as pipeline constraints and problems at compressor stations at one pipeline stranded gas produced in the Permian.



Spot prices at the Waha hub plunged to a record low of minus $4.28 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) in the first week of April.Gas production in the Permian has been rising in lockstep with crude oil production, and even though gas takeaway capacity has attracted less media attention, pipeline constraints for natural gas are similar to those of crude oil pipeline capacity.The natural gas takeaway capacity constraints have resulted in more gas flaring in the Permian on the one hand, and in a record-high spread between the Waha gas hub price and the U.S. benchmark Henry Hub in Louisiana, on the other hand.



“We will closely monitor daily pricing and return our gas to sales when it is profitable to do so. We are carefully managing these actions so there is no adverse impact on long-term wellbore integrity or reservoir productivity and look forward to returning this production to market as soon as practical,” John J. Christmann IV, CEO and president of Apache Corporation, said in a statement today.Apache contracted two years ago more than 1 billion cubic feet (Bcf) per day of long-term, firm takeaway capacity from the Permian Basin on Kinder Morgan’s pipeline projects Gulf Coast Express and Permian Highway, Apache said, noting that Gulf Coast Express is expected to be in service later this year, while Permian Highway is set to start operations next year.“We anticipate relatively wide and volatile natural gas price differentials in the Permian Basin until the Gulf Coast Express pipeline enters service. As a long-term returns-focused company, we know that production deferrals such as this will improve financial performance despite the impact on near-term volumes. This is the proper approach from both an environmental and economic perspective relative to other industry practices such as flaring or selling associated gas at a negative or unprofitable price,” Apache’s Christmann said.

Egypt is set to announce on April 27 whether President Abdel-Fattah el-Sisi can extend his term in office from 2022 to 2030 under constitutional changes put to a controversial referendum over the weekend.El-Sisi, who came to power in 2013 after a coup, is seeking to prolong his stay in office, tighten his grip over the country’s judiciary, and extend military powers in the hastily proposed referendum.El-Sisi’s rule has been called out for human rights violations, but the leader is pitching himself as a pillar of stability in a restive region where, over the past weeks, protests in Algeria and Sudan have resulted in the two countries’ respective long-term presidents leaving office.El-Sisi has turned Egypt into a major gas producer thanks to the country’s speedy development of the largest natural gas find in the Mediterranean, which came just a couple of years after he took office.



Italy’s oil and gas major Eni discovered the huge Zohr field in 2015, claiming it was the largest ever gas discovery in the Mediterranean. Following the start-up of the giant Zohr field in early 2018, Egypt became an important player in the Mediterranean. Zohr plays a key role in helping Egypt to avoid the need to import liquefied natural gas (LNG), according to the Italian energy major.Egypt will return to being a gas exporter this year and wants to be a regional gas hub due to its strategic geographic position. It is also attracting international oil majors to its oil and gas sector.Related: Investors Unconvinced By Halliburton’s Shale OptimismEarlier this year, BP’s chief executive officer Bob Dudley said that the UK-based supermajor had invested more in Egypt in each of the past two years than in any other country.



Egypt’s luck in geographical positioning and the much improved investment climate have led to an “astonishing gas renaissance” in the country, Wood Mackenzie’s Chairman and Chief Analyst, Simon Flowers, wrote in April last year.“Egypt has assumed unprecedented importance in both Eni’s and BP’s global portfolios in the short passage of time since 2015. It’s now the third most important country position for Eni by value at US$9billion, NPV10; and fourth for BP at US$11billion, NPV10,” Flowers said a year ago.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:The ‘CIA Man’ In Libya Securing Oil SupplyThe Firm Floor Under Oil PricesSaudi Arabia, Iraq Prepared To Reverse Oil Production Cuts

Tesla’s chief executive Elon Musk expects the electric vehicle (EV) maker to have robotaxis as early as next year, the manager said at the Tesla Autonomy Investor Day on Monday.“I feel very confident predicting autonomous robotaxis for Tesla next year,” Musk said at the presentation in Palo Alto, California.“Not in all jurisdictions, because we won’t have regulatory approval everywhere, but I am confident we will have at least regulatory approval somewhere, literally next year,” he said.Tesla plans a ride-sharing app of robotaxis where any customer will be able to add or remove their vehicle to the so-called ‘Tesla Network.’



“So I expect this to operate like a combination of maybe the Uber and Airbnb model,” Musk said, adding that Tesla would take 25-30 percent of the revenue.In places where there aren’t enough shared Tesla cars, the company will have “dedicated Tesla vehicles,” he added.Tesla said on Monday that “All Tesla cars being built today have the hardware necessary for full self-driving.” The EV maker also touted its new Full Self-Driving Chip which “is capable of processing up to 2300 frames per second”—an improvement of 21 times over previous generation hardware.Musk, however, admitted to the audience and investors that sometimes he isn’t on time with delivering on his promises.



“Sometimes I am not on time, but I get it done,” Musk said, as carried by CNBC, which recalls that in the past, Musk has missed some timeframes that he himself had announced for Tesla regarding the launch of new products or vehicles.Tesla will draw additional investor and analyst attention later this week when it reports Q1 figures in the afternoon on April 24.Tesla itself, as well as analysts, expect a loss for the quarter, after vehicle deliveries in Q1 slumped by 31 percent from the previous quarter, ending well below analyst estimates.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:The Biggest Winner Of Trump’s Waiver DecisionWhy Goldman Sachs Believes Oil Won’t Go HigherTrump’s Hardline On Iran Catches Markets Off-Guard

Exxon has inked a contract with Chinese Zhejiang Energy for the supply of 1 million tons of liquefied natural gas annually, the supermajor said, adding the Chinese company will build a new import terminal for the shipments.Reuters reports that the terminal Zhejiang Energy will build will have a capacity to hold 3 million tons of LNG with a US$1.34 billion price tag. Sinopec, China’s largest refiner, will be partner of Zhejiang in the project.The deal is significant first because it may go a certain way towards quenching concern that the trade dispute between Washington and Beijing would affect LNG trade just as China’s demand for the superchilled fuel is rising steadily.



However, as one analyst told Reuters, the deal is not part of the bilateral negotiations that have recently raised hopes that the trade war saga could end in a mutually beneficial deal.“The gas supplies to the Zhejiang firm will come from Exxon’s portfolio production outside the U.S.,” Chen Zhu said, adding that the terminal will begin operations sometime in 2022 or 2023. The analyst noted that Exxon already has two LNG supply deals with Chinese companies, and not just any companies: the supermajor will supply LNG to Sinopec and CNPC.Secondly, it is a long-term deal—20 years—which is even better news for other U.S. companies betting on LNG: long-term supply commitments are what they all need to secure the funding needed for the construction of the liquefaction facilities, which normally cost billions of dollars.



Exxon is one of the largest global players in liquefied natural gas, holding stakes in LNG projects that combined have a total capacity of some 65 million tons of the fuel annually. This includes the Papua New Guinea LNG project where Exxon is the majority partner and which specifically targets the Asian market—the driver of future global LNG demand.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Trump’s Hardline On Iran Catches Markets Off-GuardTrump's Latest Oil Market GambleInvestors Unconvinced By Halliburton’s Shale Optimism

Chinese Unipec, the trading arm of state oil giant Sinopec, will this week receive the first cargo of U.S. crude since shipments were suspended last September, Reuters reports, citing a source in the know that wished to remain unnamed.Reuters data shows that the load is carrying 2 million barrels of West Texas Intermediate (WTI), and is currently waiting at the port of Qingdao to unload its cargo.



The suspension of oil shipments to China resulted from the heat-up in trade talks between Washington and Beijing. Now that the two are at an advanced state in the negotiations with U.S. officials optimistic about a deal, things may be changing.It’s interesting to note that the Reuters report comes on the heels of other reports concerning the removal of Iran sanction waivers by the U.S. administration. The latest update has it that China, along with Turkey, has openly defied the removal of waivers and will continue to import Iranian crude. This will certainly have reverberations at the trade negotiations table.



On Monday, shortly after the announcement of the waiver removal, the Chinese Foreign Ministry issued a statement that said, ""China opposes the unilateral sanctions and so-called 'long-arm jurisdictions' imposed by the U.S. Our cooperation with Iran is open, transparent, lawful and legitimate, thus it should be respected."" The statement also added ""is committed to upholding the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies and will play a positive and constructive role in upholding the stability of global energy market.""This difference in positions, to put it mildly, on Iran, suggests that things are yet to get more interesting, especially after Iran renewed its regular threat that it would close the Strait of Hormuz if it cannot use it to ship its oil abroad. It also suggests that the trade deal between Washington and Beijing may not be so quick in coming.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Are China’s Crude Reserves Quietly Dwindling?Iran Threatens To Block Key Oil Chokepoint If It Can No Longer Export CrudeWhy Are Natural Gas Prices Crashing?

The United States will not be dipping into its Strategic Petroleum Reserves (SPR) to calm unsettled markets today, according to S&P Global Platts sources who were commenting about rising oil prices as WTI surpassed $65 per barrel in the late afternoon.The US may, however, consider tapping into the SPR if oil prices are too high over the summer months, according to the same sources, although President Donald Trump confidently proclaimed on Monday that Saudi Arabia and other OPEC players have the ability to turn on the taps to make up for any oil supply shortfalls left by Iran now that waivers are behind us, marking the true beginning of the US sanctions on Iran.



WTI was trading up $1.62 (+2.53%) at 3:45pm EST, reaching $65.69. Brent was trading up $2.14 (+2.97%) at $74.11—the highest price in five months.The purpose of the 700+million-barrel SPR is to insulate the United States in the event of a supply emergency, although the fact that it exists also sends the message to other oil producers that the United States has the ability to flood the market with oil should it choose to do so. It is the largest supply of emergency crude oil in the world, according to the energy.gov website.



The United States has tapped its SPR to weather global supply disruptions three times, although it has released barrels at other times as well as part of planned drawdowns. In August last year, the United States moved up a planned 2019 SPR release to soften the blow of US sanctions on Iran. The United States, however, granted eight purchases of Iranian oil waivers, sending the price of oil downward on the news.Those waivers will officially end on May 1, the White House announced on Monday.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:The ‘CIA Man’ In Libya Securing Oil SupplyThe Firm Floor Under Oil PricesSaudi Arabia, Iraq Prepared To Reverse Oil Production Cuts

The US Coast Guard identified a potential chokepoint in the Bering Strait thanks to increased oil and gas shipments, a new report showed on Monday.In a rather imperfect combination of events, the Coast Guard explains in its newest report, Arctic warming has increased shipping through this narrow and shallow strait, increasing the likelihood of collisions and groundings.  This increase in shipments through the narrow waterway is mostly due to increased shipments from Russia’s massive Yamal terminal.These Arctic shipping routes save time over other routes such as through the Straits of Malacca and the Suez Canal.



The US Geological Survey estimates that the Arctic still holds more than 10 percent of the world’s undiscovered oil, and roughly 30 percent of the world’s undiscovered gas.Russia’s Yamal LNG has the capacity of 17.4 million tons, shipping its first cargo near the end of 2017. And while that’s significant, Russia isn’t finished yet, and is contemplating tax breaks to companies who invest in the Arctic, according to Deputy Prime Minister Igor Trutnev, cited by The Moscow Times.These tax breaks are significant, and may represent a reduction of two-thirds. Its Natural Resources Ministry, according to The Moscow Times, has stressed the need for $165 billion in private investments in this region over the next decade. These projects include oil and gas extraction, as well as coal.



What’s more, Russian President Vladimir Putin is calling for major development in the area including a sizable increase in shipping through its Northern Sea Route by 2024, in what may add to the congestion in the area.The increase in Yamal traffic may see the Bering Strait added to the list of other critical oil chokepoints, including the Strait of Hormuz, the Strait of Malacca, the Suez Canal, and Bab el-Mandeb.

Halliburton Company expects total global offshore spending to jump 14 percent this year, one of the world’s largest oilfield service providers said on Monday as it announced its Q1 2019 results.Halliburton’s estimate for international offshore oil and gas spending this year exceeds the single-digit estimate for total international exploration and production spending (including onshore) of its competitor Schlumberger.“Our view of the international markets is consistent with recent third-party spending surveys, suggesting that E&P investments will increase by 7 to 8% in 2019, supported by a higher rig count and a rise in the number of customer project FIDs,” Schlumberger said in its Q1 results release last week while also flagging slowing shale oil production growth in North America.  



“In line with this, offshore development activity plans continue to strengthen, with subsea tree awards reaching their highest level since 2013 last year. We are also seeing the start of a return to exploration activity on renewed interest in reserves replacement,” Schlumberger said.Halliburton, for its part, said today that its international revenue rose by 11 percent annually in Q1 2019, a first step to high single-digit international growth for the whole of the year.“Broad-based recovery continues across all regions, and we expect this momentum to build going into 2020,” said chairman, president and CEO Jeff Miller. Referring to North America, Miller said that “the worst in the pricing deterioration is now behind us. For the next couple of quarters, I see demand for our services progressing modestly.”



According to Rystad Energy, while many shale drillers are cutting spending to focus on cash flows, internationally focused companies are expected to boost investments.“We anticipate a return of offshore investments as project sanctioning activity has picked up considerably over the past couple years, and numerous projects will soon enter the development stage,” Rystad Energy said.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads from Oilprice.com:Are China’s Crude Reserves Quietly Dwindling?Iran Threatens To Block Key Oil Chokepoint If It Can No Longer Export CrudeWhy Are Natural Gas Prices Crashing?

India will add 12 nuclear power stations to its lineup to shore up its power supply situation, the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) said on Monday, according to The Times of India.The “irreplaceable source of clean, pollution-free energy” is expected to be a significant and essential part of India’s energy needs, KN Vyas, DAE secretary said at an industry event in Russia, adding that there is no substitute for nuclear energy as it is particularly reliable.Vyas highlighted its Kaiga Nuclear Power station which, according to him, has had a streak of 962 uninterrupted days of runtime.



As of 2018, six nuclear reactors were being constructed in India to meet the growing needs of the country.  Its nuclear capacity was expected to triple by 2031. India’s Nuclear Power Corporation, tasked with building and operating India’s power plants, had voiced reservations about this ambitious timeline, saying that it would need to lower those expectations, according to a Telegraph report. In 2018, India slashes its nuclear power plant construction plans by two-thirds, an unfortunate reality that was expected to increase its reliance on coal power.India has long battled pollution problems, with the WHO estimating that at its worst, India can be 70 times dirtier than what the WHO considers safe. Nuclear power could prevent worsening of this pollution problem as its energy needs continue to grow.India is a signatory to the Paris Climate Agreement, and ranks 14th on the Global Climate Risk Index, according to Business Insider India, yet still it is vulnerable. Plans to be the world’s greatest solar energy success has fallen flat. It is largely dependent—perhaps too much so—on thermal and hydropower plants, both which require water. Nuclear power could add another layer of security for India.



“The founder of Indian nuclear programme, Homi J Bhabha had envisaged that nuclear technology is going to be very essential and not just in the power sector but for other societal uses intended for betterment of life,” Vyas said.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:The Undeniable Signs Of A Shale SlowdownSharp Drop In U.S. Rig Count Marks First Yearly Loss Since 2016U.S. Greenlights Two Major LNG Export Projects

House prices in the top U.S. ZIP codes for electric vehicles (EVs) are higher in areas in close proximity to EV charging stations than in the surrounding metro areas, a new analysis by realtor.com showed on Monday.The analysis used data from Open Charge Map to track 19,743 charging stations across 6,980 ZIP codes, and then analyzed the housing markets of the top 20 areas with the most EV charging stations.The realtor.com analysis found that the median listing price for the top 20 ZIP codes for EV charging stations—of which nine are in California—is US$782,000. This is 1.5 times higher than the listing price in their surrounding areas and a good 2.6 times higher than the rest of the U.S.



“Our data shows there’s definitely a link between the prevalence of electric vehicle charging stations and higher home prices,” Danielle Hale, chief economist at realtor.com, said in a statement.“But there’s a difference between correlation and causation. The trend we’re seeing in the data is most likely a result of the fact that wealthier homeowners are more likely to purchase expensive electric vehicles. But regardless of the cause, if you’re shopping for a home in a ZIP with an abundance of electric vehicle charging stations, you’ll likely pay a premium,” Hale said.The top 20 ZIP codes for EVs in the U.S., based on the number of EV charging stations per ZIP code, is topped by Irvine, California, followed by Paso Robles, California; Orlando, Florida; San Diego, California; and Saint Helena, California.



Outside California, the top 20 ZIP codes includes cities in Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Nevada, New York, Ohio, South Carolina, and Texas, the realtor.com analysis showed.  By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads from Oilprice.com:Are China’s Crude Reserves Quietly Dwindling?Iran Threatens To Block Key Oil Chokepoint If It Can No Longer Export CrudeWhy Are Natural Gas Prices Crashing?

The operator of the Nembe Creek Trunk Line—one of the two key pipelines of Nigeria’s Bonny Light crude grade capable of transporting 150,000 bpd to the export terminal—declared on Sunday force majeure, due to a fire suspected to have been the result of an illegal third-party breach.  “Our Operations Emergency Response team was immediately activated and following its urgent intervention and containment action, we are constrained to shut in injection as well as other related operations into the NCTL. In accordance with standard procedure, we requested the other injectors to do same,” Nigerian operator Aiteo said in a statement, as carried by Sahara Reporters.Before the fire broke out, the Nembe Creek Trunk Line was operating smoothly, which raises suspicion that the fire was the result of an “illegitimate, third-party breach of the functionality of the pipeline,” the statement by Aiteo spokesman Ndiana Matthew said.



Investigations into the cause of the fire continue and the stakeholders will be briefed in details in due course, said the company.Two months ago, a fire erupted in an area around the Nembe Creek Trunk Line, but then Aiteo said that the pipeline was not impacted by the fire. At that time in early March, Shell, whose Nigerian unit operates exports from the Bonny Light terminal, said that there was no force majeure declared on Nigeria’s Bonny Light exports.Bonny Light is a popular grade among refiners globally and its production is 200,000 bpd-250,000 bpd. The Bonny Light terminal or the pipelines feeding crude to the export facility were subject to many disruptions and declarations of force majeure in 2016 and 2017, when militant activity across the Niger Delta was frequently shutting oil exports from Nigeria.



Now, any potential disruption of the Bonny Light crude oil exports in the coming days or weeks could further tighten an already tightening market with the U.S. reportedly aiming at zero Iranian oil exports and tightening the sanctions on Venezuela, plus unrest in Libya, and continued cuts by OPEC and allies.

Iran will block the world’s most important chokepoint for global oil trade, the Strait of Hormuz, if Tehran is barred from using it to export its oil, Navy Rear Admiral Alireza Tangsiri, Commander of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC), said on Monday, just as the U.S. announced that it would not be extending any waivers to Iranian oil customers.""According to international law, the Strait of Hormuz is a marine passageway and if we are barred from using it, we will shut it down. In case of any threat, we will have not even an iota of doubt to protect and defend the Iranian waters. We will defend our prestige and embark on reciprocal acts when it comes to defending Iran's right,"" Iranian Fars news agency quoted Tangsiri as saying in an interview with Arabic-language al-Alam news channel on Monday.U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tweeted early on Monday, confirming earlier reports that the U.S. planned to end all waivers when they expire in early May:



“Maximum pressure on the Iranian regime means maximum pressure. That’s why the U.S. will not issue any exceptions to Iranian oil importers. The global oil market remains well-supplied. We’re confident it will remain stable as jurisdictions transition away from Iranian crude.”The Department of State confirmed:“Today we are announcing the United States will not issue any additional Significant Reduction Exceptions to existing importers of Iranian oil. The Trump Administration has taken Iran’s oil exports to historic lows, and we are dramatically accelerating our pressure campaign in a calibrated way that meets our national security objectives while maintaining well supplied global oil markets.”  Related: Trump’s Oil Waiver Decision Is A Double-Edged Sword

Some 80 percent of the crude oil shipped through the Strait of Hormuz goes to Asian markets, the EIA has estimated using data from Lloyd’s List Intelligence tanker tracking service.

Aramco will buy Shell’s stake in their jointly owned refining company SASREF for US$631 million as part of an ambitious expansion strategy for Aramco’s downstream business to secure markets for its future crude oil production.“Saudi Aramco will take full ownership and integrate the refinery into its growing downstream portfolio. SASREF will continue to be a critical facility in our refining and chemicals business,” Reuters quoted a statement by the companies as saying.For Shell, on the other hand, the sale is part of an ongoing streamlining drive combined with a divestment program that has seen the supermajor sell US$30 billion worth of assets over the past few years in a bid to reduce its substantial debt load after the acquisition of BG Group.



The news coincided with another report of a Saudi acquisition: Arabian Drilling Company said it would buy the local business of Schlumberger, as quoted by Saudi media citing anonymous sources. The value of the deal remained undisclosed.Earlier this month, media reported that Aramco wanted to double the capacity of its refinery network to 10 million bpd by 2030. This would make it the biggest refiner in the world and accomplish the company’s goal of securing markets for its future oil output as the world moves away from crude but not away from petrochemicals, apparently.Related: Trump’s Oil Waiver Decision Is A Double-Edged SwordSince organic growth for the Saudi major’s refining business would not hit the 10-million-bpd mark fast enough, Aramco is expanding through acquisitions. The latest here is negotiations for the acquisition of a 25-percent stake in the refining and petrochemicals business of India’s Reliance Industries. According to Indian media reports, a stake sale of this size could cost US$10-15 billion, with the whole business valued at US$60 billion. However, Reliance is now looking to up this, improving the potential proceeds from the deal.



Also in India, Aramco is taking an active investment part in the US$44-billion Ratnagiri refinery and petrochemicals project. It has, however, run into delays, which would mean cost overruns, after Ratnagiri farmers refused to give up the land needed to build the complex and it had to be moved from that region to neighboring Raigad.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:The Perfect Storm That Could Drive Oil Even HigherPermian Oil Now Selling At A DiscountTop Heavy Oil Markets Continue To Rally

The US-recognized interim president of Venezuela called on the country’s people to hold the “largest march in the history of Venezuela” to urge Nicolas Maduro to leave office as the country languishes in chaos.“We call on all the people to join in the largest march in the history of Venezuela to demand the end to the usurpation so this tragedy can end,” Guaido said on Friday, according to Reuters.The Venezuelan crisis has seen its oil industry reduced to a shadow of what it once was as the country’s oil production fell to new lows in March of 732,000 bpd—down from an average of 1.354 million bpd in 2018 and 1.911 million bpd in 2017, according to secondary sources provided by the latest edition of OPEC’s Monthly Oil Market Report.



Despite its reduced production levels, the country is experiencing a traffic jam offshore as US sanctions on the country stymie oil payments to the Latin American nation from would-be buyers, stranding already loaded cargo off the coast.In addition to its oil industry woes, the country has suffered numerous blackouts in recent months—all while being managed by two opposing leaders in Maduro and Guaido. There are even two PDVSA boards—one for each party.The US has steadily increased pressure on the troubled Latin nation, the latest round of which targeted Venezuela’s shipments to Cuba—an entrenched arrangement predating Maduro’s reign that provided Venezuela with much-needed skilled labor such as doctors and oil workers.



Guaido continues to try to wrest control of the country and its state-run oil company, and his National Assembly is expecting to vote on Monday on a $71 million interest payment on one of PDVSA’s bonds next week, Guaido’s appointed PDVSA board of directors announced today, according to Reuters. The payment would stave off potential creditors looking to get their due from PDVSA’s US-based refining arm, Citgo.

Russia and Saudi Arabia’s cooperation is set to continue, Ibrahim al-Muhanna, Saudi energy advisor, said on Friday, in hopes of allaying the lingering fears that Russia is itching to get out from under the deal that has restricted its crude oil production.Russia’s finance minister last weekend hinted that Russia may fight America for its share of the oil market by bailing on the OPEC deal—even doing so lowers the price of oil. The statement sparked fear in the oil market that the agreement forged with OPEC was drawing to a premature close.Russia has yet to decrease production to the level that it agreed to for its deal with OPEC and other nonOPEC signatories to the deal. While Russia was upfront about its inability to instantly reduce production to its quota under the deal, it said it would reach those levels by end of March or early April.



Russia’s crude oil production in April stood at 11.24 million barrels per day, still slightly off its promised level of 11.191 million bpd.Today’s words may give the market more confidence in the cartel and company’s stick-to-itiveness to do whatever it takes to balance the oil market.“Cooperation will continue between Russia and Saudi Arabia. It is the core of OPEC+ cooperation,” al-Muhanna said today at the International Oil Summit in Paris. 



While this cooperation continues, Russia and Saudi Arabia are often at odds over publicly spoken words regarding the balance in the oil market and when the deal will again be reviewed. The current production cut deal is for now scheduled to end in June, with the two finding themselves once again with differing opinions on whether the deal should go beyond June, and if so, for how long and at what volume.The signatories to the deal are for now taking a wait and see approach, with many geopolitical variables that need to be considered, mostly notably possible supply disruptions in Libya, Iran, and Venezuela.Al-Muhanna said on Friday that he expected the oil market to be “well balanced”.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Why Elon Musk Is Wrong About HydrogenThe Firm Floor Under Oil PricesKey Oil Demand Driver Set For Boost Later This Year

The state oil company of OPEC member Angola, Sonangol, plans to sell off stakes in dozens of joint ventures and cut jobs in order to focus on its core exploration and production business in Africa, Sonangol’s chairman Carlos Saturnino said on Friday.“Instead of investing in Australia, United States etc, Sonangol wants to become an oil company of reference in the African continent. This is major change for us,” Reuters quoted Saturnino as saying at an oil industry event in Paris today.The Angolan company has identified as many as 52 joint ventures from which it wants to exit, the chairman added.The goal of the downsizing is to focus on the core African continent business, make the company more agile, and attract international oil majors back to the Angolan oil industry.



Sonangol has been working with France’s Total and Italy’s Eni on analyzing data for oil blocks in Angola, Saturnino said on Friday. The Angolan state firm has also signed early agreements with U.S. supermajor ExxonMobil and has met with Shell to try to persuade it to return to investing in Angola, Sonangol’s chairman said, as carried by Reuters.Angola has been struggling in recent years to offset a decline in its oil production as many fields mature.After the oil price crash of 2014, Angola’s economy suffered from the low oil prices and struggled to attract international investments in its deepwater higher-breakeven oil resources.Related: The Giant Floating LNG Project You’ve Never Heard Of



Last year, Angola introduced several new measures to try to boost its oil production and its attractiveness for international investment. President Joao Lourenco signed in the summer of 2018 a decree to create an agency that would sell and manage oil blocks instead of Sonangol.Earlier in 2018, Angola halved the tax rates on the development of oil discoveries with fewer than 300 million barrels of reserves.According to OPEC’s latest available figures, Angola’s crude oil production in March stood at 1.454 million bpd—up by 7,000 bpd from February but still below its cap under the OPEC+ deal of 1.481 million bpd.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:The Undeniable Signs Of A Shale SlowdownSharp Drop In U.S. Rig Count Marks First Yearly Loss Since 2016Huge Interest In Oil & Gas Defies This ‘Millenial’ Investment Trend

Despite low fuel prices, scarce charging networks, and battery capacity problems, U.S. carmakers are forging ahead with their EV plans as regulatory pressure on the sector increases, Reuters reports, citing industry insiders.According to data from the International Energy Agency, the country ranks seventh in the world in terms of EV sales and Tesla accounts for a third of this, as of the end of 2018. As a proportion of total sales, electric cars and hybrids accounted for 2 percent last year, at 361,307, according to Inside EVs.Projections for the future are not overly optimistic, either. “It’s going to be a pretty long runway,” Reuters quoted an analyst from Autrotrader, Michelle Krebs, as saying. Krebs added that the biggest initial boost to electric car sales in the United States would likely come from corporate and government fleets.



Indeed, the obstacles in the way of faster EV adoptions would need a while to be overcome: range is still an issue in a nation where driving is a deeply ingrained part of the culture but so is the availability of charging stations, the latter a problem that’s global.Also, there is the challenge that comes from low fuel prices, despite their recent rise as international benchmark oil prices climb higher on the OPEC+ cuts, falling production in Venezuela, and expectations of a slowdown in demand driven by slower economic growth.Another problem is the higher upfront costs for electric vehicles, which again have to do with the batteries, which are the costliest component in EVs. This is a conundrum yet to be solved while making ranges longer and efficiencies higher, along with cutting charging times.



The situation is certainly complex and fraught with difficulties. However, with carmakers spending billions on the design and construction of various electric cars in anticipation of the EV era that media are hyping about, doing a U-turn is not an option and focus probably remains on the longer term when at least some of the most pressing problems would be at least partially solved.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:The Undeniable Signs Of A Shale SlowdownExxon Makes Another Discovery In This New Oil HotspotU.S. Greenlights Two Major LNG Export Projects

American refiners are preparing for a busy overhaul season in the second quarter of the year as the entry into effect of the new International Maritime Organization’s emission rules approaches.Reuters cites data from the Energy Information Administration that total U.S. production of refined production has fallen 8.5 percent since the start of the year, suggesting it has yet to fall further. The aim is to avoid the need for maintenance closures ahead of winter this year.The new IMO emission rules cap sulfur emissions from bunkering fuel at 0.5 percent, which is a substantial reduction on the current 3.5-percent cap. As a result, refiners have raced to prepare for the demand for new, lower-sulfur fuels.



Many see the upcoming changes as the most important to hit the refining industry in quite a while. Last month, the International Energy Agency said in its annual Oil 2019 report, “The 2020 IMO marine regulation change is one of the most dramatic ever seen to product specifications, although the shipping and refining industries have had several years notice.”In the immediate term, this spells even higher gasoline and diesel prices for U.S. drivers, adding to a 26-percent increase in gasoline prices at the pump since the start of 2019.“They will push (winter) turnarounds later into 2020 to take advantage of that margin bump from the switch to IMO 2020,” an associate at IHS Markit told Reuters, commenting on refiners’ plans to move maintenance and overhauls to the second quarter of the year.



Reuters notes that usually, the second quarter is the time when refiners increase their output of gasoline and diesel in anticipation of peak demand season during the summer. This year, however, according to IHS Markit’s Susan Bell, as much as 1 million bpd in refining capacity could be shut in for maintenance. This will certainly push prices even higher.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:U.S. Energy Consumption Hits All-Time RecordMegadeal Triggers M&A Spree In The PermianThe Case For $100 Oil

The Nicolas Maduro government is directing revenues from crude oil sales to Russia’s Rosneft as a way around U.S. sanctions, Reuters reports citing documents and unnamed sources.The Venezuelan government, according to its investigation, invoices oil sales to the Russian giant, which pays for these sales at a discount to the market price. After this, Reuters says, Rosneft sells the oil on and collects the full price. Among the companies asked to take part in this payments scheme was Reliance Industries, India’s largest refiner and PDVSA’s biggest paying client, Reuters noted.Rosneft is one of the few foreign partners of PDVSA that have operations in the troubled country and it is also one of its largest creditors, with amounts lent since 2006 reaching US$16 billion. The loans are on a cash-for-oil basis, like a lot of PDVSA’s loan agreements with Chinese state energy players.



The payments scheme comes as Washington seeks to tighten the noose around Venezuela as it wants to topple Maduro and replace him with opposition leader Juan Guaido, who proclaimed himself interim president of the country in January and has since then been recognized as the legal leader of Venezuela by most Western countries.Russia and China, however, have stayed away from the recognition drive, with Russia directly calling the U.S. sanctions against PDVSA illegal and saying it will continue to support the elected Venezuelan government.China, for its part, has been more guarded in its statement, although earlier this month a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Minister slammed U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for accusing Beijing of taking an active part in the economic collapse of Venezuela.

Imports of crude oil to the U.S. Gulf Coast dived to their lowest level in almost three decades last week, due to OPEC’s production cuts, unusually low Iraqi shipments, and congestion on the Houston Ship Channel from a tank farm fire last month.   According to weekly preliminary U.S. government data, cited by Bloomberg, the Gulf Coast’s crude imports were just 1.4 million bpd last week, with imports from Iraq at only 5,000 bpd. The shipments from Iraq were at their lowest since August 2015, when the U.S. didn’t import any Iraqi crude oil.  The low volumes from Iraq, plus the Saudi tactic to focus on cutting exports to the U.S. in a bid to draw down the most transparently reported oil inventories in the world, resulted in U.S. imports from its top six suppliers from OPEC dropping to below 1 million bpd last week. This was the first time such imports have dropped to below the 1-million-bpd mark in data going back to 2010, according to Bloomberg.



Apart from the reduced imports from Saudi Arabia and Iraq, the fire at the Intercontinental Terminals Company’s (ITC) petrochemical storage site at Deer Park, Texas, in the middle of March blazed for days and halted some ship traffic at the Houston port, and continued to disrupt tanker traffic into the U.S. Gulf Coast for weeks.Earlier this month, the U.S. Coast Guard restricted outbound traffic at the Houston Ship Channel, due to storms that had suspended cleaning-up after the fire and the chemical spill.On Wednesday, the EIA reported a 1.4-million-barrel crude draw in the week to April 12, accompanied by a draw in gasoline stockpiles.



“The key driver behind the draw was the fall in weekly crude oil imports,” Warren Patterson, Head of Commodities Strategy at ING, said on Thursday, noting that the total U.S. drop of 607,000 bpd week-on-week to average 5.99 million bpd was driven by the Gulf Coast, and “likely reflects the disruptions in shipping we have seen in Houston in recent weeks.”  By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:China’s Newest Oil Hotspot Is In America’s BackyardWhy Elon Musk Is Wrong About HydrogenSharp Drop In U.S. Rig Count Marks First Yearly Loss Since 2016

Funds managed by T. Rowe Price, which was until recently the second-largest shareholder in Tesla after Elon Musk, significantly cut their holdings in the electric vehicle (EV) maker in the past six months, Reuters reports, quoting Refinitiv data.  T. Rowe Price Associates held a total of 8,977,064 shares in Tesla as of December 31, 2018, accounting for 5.2 percent of all Tesla’s stock, a filing to the SEC showed.In a previous SEC filing at the end of September, T. Rowe Price had reported that it held 17.4 million shares in Tesla as of September 30, 2018, or 10.2 percent of Tesla’s stock.



After halving its stake in Tesla in the fourth quarter of 2018 to 5.2 percent from 10.2 percent, T. Rowe Price continued to cut its shareholding in the EV maker in Q1, according to Refinitiv data cited by Reuters.In the first quarter of 2019, T. Rowe Price divested 92 percent of its previous interest in Tesla, data from Refinitiv showed, but the data may not include all funds managed by T. Rowe Price, Reuters notes.Once a top shareholder, the drastic reduction in T. Rowe Price’s stake in Tesla over the past six months could be bad news for Tesla bulls, especially after negative sentiment had started to build up around the company again.



In the first quarter this year, Tesla had a challenging time with deliveries, with its total vehicle deliveries slumping by 31 percent from the previous quarter, ending well below analyst estimates.Tesla delivered around 63,000 vehicles in Q1, up by 110 percent compared to the first quarter of 2018, but 31 percent lower than the vehicles delivered in Q4 2018, the EV maker said earlier this month.Meanwhile, true to himself, Elon Musk continued to taunt the SEC with tweets amid a dispute over his unchecked and potentially stock-moving tweets about Tesla’s performance.

Russian diplomats have tried to buy riot gear in Malta and allegedly load it on a warship en route to Venezuela, in a move that raises concerns in the EU and the U.S. that Russia wants to increase its military presence in Venezuela, BuzzFeed News reported on Thursday, citing officials.Russia has also asked Malta for permission to dock the Russian anti-submarine ship, the Severomorsk, in Malta for several days at the end of this month, BuzzFeed News Europe Editor Alberto Nardelli reports, quoting a senior government official from Malta. On Tuesday this week, Russia withdrew the request for the ship to dock on the Mediterranean island, but Malta would have denied the request anyway, according to BuzzFeed News’ sources.  This is not the first report of Russia trying to boost its military presence in Venezuela, where Moscow is the staunchest supporter and ally of Nicolas Maduro’s regime in the political power struggle in the Latin American country sitting on top of the world’s largest oil reserves.



The U.S. and many European nations have recognized Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó as the legitimate interim president. Russia, however, has stood by Maduro for years and has poured billions of U.S. dollars in Venezuela in the form of loans and oil investments.Russia’s state-controlled oil giant Rosneft has extended US$6 billion of loans to Venezuela’s state oil firm PDVSA. As of December 31, 2018, Venezuela still owed Rosneft US$2.3 billion.Two Russian planes with 100 troops landed in Venezuela at the end of March, Reuters reported, citing media reports and flight tracking websites. The move is the latest signal of strengthening ties between Caracas and Moscow amid growing pressure on the Maduro government from Washington.



It also comes three months after the Venezuelan and Russian army conducted joint military exercises in Venezuela. At the time, the U.S. government slammed the exercises as Russian “encroachment” in South America.Meanwhile, U.S. National Security Advisor John Bolton said in an interview with Bloomberg News on Wednesday that the Trump Administration was looking to persuade Russia to ditch support for Maduro.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Sharp Drop In U.S. Rig Count Marks First Yearly Loss Since 2016Why Elon Musk Is Wrong About HydrogenChina’s Newest Oil Hotspot Is In America’s Backyard

Brazil will hold an offshore oil deposit auction in October featuring blocks that were the object of a long-running dispute with state energy giant Petrobras.Reuters reports, citing Economy Minister Paulo Guedes, that participants in the auction will need to cough up a signing bonus of a total US$26.9 billion for the four blocks.The blocks, located in the presalt zone off the Brazilian coast, are part of an area the government awarded for exploration and development to Petrobras a decade ago. Under the original deal, it had the right to extract 5 billion barrels of oil and gas based on the oil prices at the time. The complex provisions of the contract, however, included a review of the costs in the area after it was declared commercially viable in 2014.



Both parties—the government and Petrobras—have claimed that they are owed billions of U.S. dollars, and the oil company has also disputed the estimates of the reserves in the area made by the country’s oil regulator, ANP.The state oil firm has explored the area and found that a lot more oil lies in this low-risk offshore zone. There are estimates that the transfer-of-rights area could hold up to 15 billion barrels of oil in excess of the 5 billion barrels to which Petrobras was entitled to produce when the government transferred the area to the state firm in 2010.The four blocks to be auctioned in October contain that excess 10 billion barrels in reserves.



Meanwhile, Petrobras and the Brazilian government have all but settled their differences regarding the transfer of rights to the area. Last month, Reuters cited Brazilian media as saying the government was likely to pay Petrobras some US$10 billion, which was lower than a previously reported US$14 billion but still a substantial sum.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Artificial Intelligence Could Solve Nuclear Fusion's Biggest ProblemOil Could Fall To $40 If OPEC Abandons Its DealThe Genius Solution To The Electric Bus Problem

Saudi Arabia continued to slash its oil exports as this year progressed, with February crude shipments dropping by 227,000 bpd from January to just below 7 million bpd, as the Kingdom is determined to rebalance the market in its effort to support oil prices.According to data released on Thursday by the Joint Organisations Data Initiative (JODI) database, which collects self-reported figures from 114 countries, Saudi Arabia’s crude oil exports stood at 6.977 million bpd in February, compared to 7.254 million bpd in January and to 7.687 million bpd in December 2018, when the Kingdom started to aggressively cut oil supply to prevent another glut.Total Saudi crude oil and oil products exports dropped by 432,000 bpd from January to 8.44 million bpd in February 2019, according to JODI’s data.



The figures by JODI, as well as OPEC’s production numbers, show that Saudi Arabia is keeping its pledge to drastically reduce oil supply to the market and to over-deliver in its share of the OPEC+ production cuts.In an interview with the Financial Times in February, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said that the Saudis would cut production tos around 9.8 million bpd in March, some 500,000 bpd below the commitment in the OPEC+ deal. Al-Falih also said that Saudi Arabia would be cutting its crude oil exports to near 6.9 million bpd in March, slashed from the November high of 8.2 million bpd.  Related: Oil Could Fall To $40 If OPEC Abandons Its DealIn early March, Saudi Arabia signaled that it is determined to do ‘whatever it takes’ to rebalance the market by keeping its April crude oil exports at below 7 million bpd, despite requests for more than 7.6 million bpd of Saudi oil from its customers. The lower allocations by Saudi Aramco for April will also mean that the Kingdom’s oil production will be “well below 10 million bpd” in April, a Saudi official told Reuters.



Saudi Arabia, OPEC’s largest producer and de facto leader, has been signaling that it would do whatever it takes to rebalance the market (and support oil prices), and followed through on its commitment to cut much deeper than pledged in the pact, as OPEC’s March production dipped to a four-year low.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Artificial Intelligence Could Solve Nuclear Fusion's Biggest ProblemThe Genius Solution To The Electric Bus ProblemTexas Has A New Favorite Energy Source

Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez yesterday released a cartoon video with an overview of the Green New Deal she spearheaded in Congress in a bid to arrest the progress of what she deems devastating climate change.The narrative in the video begins by focusing on Big Oil’s—and specifically Exxon’s—knowledge of climate change and the industry’s deliberate efforts to keep it out of the public attention and even finance climate change skepticism and doubt.The story makes a point of noting scientists’ statements on climate change with an emphasis on a recent warning that we have 12 years to reduce our carbon footprint by half or risk a lot more devastation and livelihood destruction in various parts of the world.



The narrator then goes on to describe a rosy future in which renewable power has beaten fossil fuels, pipelines are being replaced by mangroves using oil workers “in transition” who receive the same pay and benefits as their old oil jobs, and Native American knowledge of taking care of the land is being applied to deal with the horrible effects of climate change including floods and storms, and Miami sinking in the ocean.The final note is optimistic, with people having “meaningful jobs” and universal health insurance, the fight for reversing climate change apparently won.Related: This Tweak Could Be A Gamechanger For Lithium-Ion BatteriesIn all fairness, the video could make a great educational tool at schools, which may be one of its purposes. However, it appears to not be specifically targeting children, which means some watchers may be disappointed by the lack of any specific details as to how such a complete transformation could be achieved in reality.



The answer, of course, is in the Green New Deal itself, although the actual details of how the massive investments in renewable power infrastructure and permanent job creation in a post-oil world will work have not yet been worked out.Naturally, the plan was met with severe criticism by Republican lawmakers, but won the praise of the environmentalist lobby. Critics note the price tag of the initiative, which a right-leaning organization estimated at US$93 trillion. However, supporters argue that not doing anything to combat climate change will cost a lot more in the long run.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:U.S. Energy Consumption Hits All-Time RecordMegadeal Triggers M&A Spree In The PermianThe Case For $100 Oil

Alberta’s new Premier-designate Jason Kenney has wasted no time in launching his energy agenda: he plans to address British Columbia’s opposition to oil pipeline projects by threatening to turn off the oil and gas taps right after he takes office later this month.The Globe and Mail quoted Kenney as saying he had spoken to the premiers of both British Columbia and Quebec, as well as to federal PM Justin Trudeau regarding the pressing pipeline matter that has plagued Canada’s oil province for more than a year now.Although Kenney told media he was looking to win friends for Alberta’s energy priorities, his approach can hardly be called entirely friendly given the threat to turn off the taps.



“You don’t start a relationship by shouting at each other. You start it by talking and trying to find common ground,” the Alberta Premier-designate told media. “We will begin with the path of diplomacy and … we hope that we don’t need to use more forceful measures to assert Alberta’s vital economic interests,” Kenney added in what can hardly be called a subtle threat.The United Conservative Party won the provincial vote in Alberta on Tuesday with an overwhelming majority, promising a harder line on energy issues as a champion for the oil industry.Its leader, Kenney, pledged on the campaign trail to remove the carbon tax introduced in the oil province and challenge legislation that neighbor British Columbia is pushing that would give it more power over inter-province infrastructure projects. The goal is to stop for good the Trans Mountain oil pipeline expansion project.Related: The 2020 Elections Could Be A Turning Point For Oil & Gas



With Quebec, however, Kenney apparently plans to be indeed friendly, betting on the province’s distaste for imported energy versus domestic supplies.“The polls in Quebec show that Quebeckers prefer to buy and consume Canadian energy to foreign energy imports … . I think they would see no social acceptability for dictator oil that fuels conflict around the world,” Kenney said.However, Quebec’s PM does not seem to agree. François Legault said yesterday Quebec did not need new pipelines and they were not socially acceptable. Kenny called the comment an unfortunate choice of words in yet another sign inter-provincial relations are going to be interesting to follow.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Could This Be The Next High Profile Permian Takeover?Oil Could Fall To $40 If OPEC Abandons Its DealArtificial Intelligence Is Transforming Oil Trade

Spanish Repsol is suspending fuel shipments to Venezuela due to fears that it could violate the US sanctions against the Latin American nation, according to Reuters. The fuel was provided by Repsol to Venezuela in exchange for crude oil.Repsol and Venezuela began the product swaps since late 2018, and have continued the arrangement until now, despite the sanctions that have been in place for months. Those sanctions ban the use of US financial institutions to conduct oil business with PDVSA.



It is unclear whether this suspension will eventually become permanent, according to Reuters sources, pending the outcome of talks between Repsol and Washington.The complicated relationship between Repsol and PDVSA is contributing to the growing stockpile of tankers lingering off the Port of Jose—Venezuela’s largest port. At least two tankers chartered by Repsol—laden with PDVSA crude oil—have been sitting off the Venezuelan coast for more than a week. They join an already mounting problem next to tankers chartered by Chevron, Citgo, and Valero who are also having problems figuring out whether doing business with PDVSA is still in their best interest, and if so, how to go about doing that business, specifically how to pay for the crude.



Venezuela is struggling to get its crude oil out of the country, not just because of US sanctions, but because of repeated blackouts that shut the port of Jose. Oil exports fell sharply in February under the weight of the sanctions, and then fell just slightly in March to below 1 million bpd.Exports are likely to fall even further with Repsol suspending its take along with a new round of sanctions set to stop Venezuela’s crude oil from getting to its neighbor, Cuba.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:This Tweak Could Be A Gamechanger For Lithium-Ion BatteriesOil Rebounds On Bullish Inventory DataU.S. Shale Is Upending Crude Flows In This Oil Frontier

Production outages and maintenance are set to push Angola’s oil exports to a 13-year low, according to an industry source quoted by Reuters. There are just 38 oil cargoes scheduled in June, a 10-cargo loss from May levels and represents the lowest exports since this data first began to be tracked in 2006. Just 1.2 million barrels per day are scheduled to be exported from Angola in June. Exports averaged 1.58 million barrels per day in 2017.The lower exports are a result of production issues at Angola’s Girassol offshore platform this month, along with a shutdown of its Saturno oilfield to conduct necessary maintenance.



Angola’s oil production has slowly dropped over recent years, averaging 1.63 million bpd in 2017 and 1.51 million bpd in 2018, before falling to 1.45 million in the first quarter of this year, according to secondary sources from OPEC’s Monthly Oil Market Report, as aging fields struggle to maintain their rates. Its production cut cap under the OPEC agreement is 1.481 million bpd—higher than what Angola is currently producing.Angola has implemented several new measures over the last year to try and increase its oil production. Measures included reducing tax rates on smaller oil discoveries and creating an agency that would handle oil blocks up for auction rather than its poorly reputed state-run oil company, Sonangol.Crude oil represents almost 90 percent of all exports from Angola—most of which makes its way to China—and accounts for 80 percent of all government revenues, according to  the Republic of Angola website.



The most recent development in Angola’s oil industry is the Kaombo Sul project by France’s Total, which started up earlier this month, adding 115,000 barrels per day to existing capacity.

Kuwait will start this year the first phase of a heavy oil field production, aiming to boost heavy crude output to 430,000 bpd from 60,000 bpd by January, the official Kuwait News Agency (KUNA) reports.Heavy crude oil production from the first phase of an oil field in northern Kuwait, known as “Al-Ritqa” is forecast to hit 11,000 bpd in August this year, KUNA quoted Kuwait Oil Company (KOC) as saying.The Al-Ritqa oil field project is aimed at boosting heavy crude oil production to 430,000 bpd from 60,000 bpd via multiple production phases by January, Fatama Al-Kanderi, who is responsible for project planning at KOC, said at a recent panel discussion organized by the Kuwaiti oil ministry.



Increasing heavy crude output in northern Kuwait is one of the pillars of the Kuwaiti 2040 oil production strategy, KUNA quoted Al-Kanderi as saying at the panel.Nearly two years ago, Kuwait announced plans to increase its crude oil production capacity to 4.75 million bpd by 2040, compared to a current capacity of 3.15 million bpd.In early 2018, the state-owned Kuwait Petroleum Corporation (KPC) said that it would spend around US$500 billion by 2040 to boost the Arab Gulf state’s oil production capacity. KPC’s chief executive officer Nizar al-Adsani said in January 2018 that KPC expected to spend US$114 billion over the following five years and another US$394 billion after the five-year period through 2040.



While Kuwait plans to boost its heavy crude oil output and production capacity in the future, it is currently cutting its oil production as part of the OPEC and allies’ deal to remove a total of 1.2 million bpd from the market between January and June, in a bid to rebalance the market.Kuwait—like another Saudi ally, the United Arab Emirates (UAE)—is strictly adhering and even over-delivering in its production reduction under the OPEC+ deal. Kuwait’s crude oil output in March stood at 2.709 million bpd, according to OPEC’s secondary sources, compared to a 2.724-million-bpd cap under the deal.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Could This Be The Next High Profile Permian Takeover?Oil Could Fall To $40 If OPEC Abandons Its DealArtificial Intelligence Is Transforming Oil Trade

Since eastern strongman General Khalifa Haftar ordered his self-styled Libyan National Army (LNA) to march on Tripoli, almost 180 people have died and 800 others have been wounded in the latest escalation of violence in one of OPEC’s most volatile member states.Nearly two weeks ago troops loyal to General Haftar started advancing westward on Libya’s capital Tripoli and clashed with troops of the UN-backed government in a renewed confrontation that could escalate and threaten to disrupt, once again, Libya’s oil production and exports.The flare-up of hostilities helped to drive oil prices last week to their highest in five months amid fears that the renewed fighting may impact Libya’s oil industry.  Also last week, the chairman of Libya’s National Oil Corporation (NOC), Mustafa Sanalla, told the Financial Times in an interview that Libya’s oil production is under threat from the renewed fighting and the situation could become as bad as it was during the 2011 civil war.



“I am afraid the situation could be much worse than 2011 because of the size of forces now involved,” Sanalla told the FT, adding “Unless the problem is solved very quickly, I am afraid this will affect our operations, and soon we will not be able to produce oil or gas.” Clashes between Haftar’s LNA and troops of the UN-backed government of national accord (GNA) continued on Tuesday and Wednesday, while the UN Security Council is debating whether to adopt a resolution drafted by the UK and demanding a ceasefire in Libya.Ghassan Salame, Special Representative of the Secretary-General and Head of the UN Support Mission in Libya, tweeted on Wednesday:“Horrible night of random shelling of residential areas.

“I am deeply concerned about the escalation of violence in Libya in the context of the resurging conflict,” Fatou Bensouda, Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC), said in a statement on Tuesday.The escalation of violence increases the risk of an oil supply outage in Libya, despite the fact that the key oil fields and oil exporting terminals are far from the capital Tripoli.

Egypt plans to slash fuel and electricity subsidies in its 2019/2020 financial year, the finance ministry’s draft budget shows, but raising fuel prices closer to international levels could turn out to be an even more severe burden on the population, potentially leading to protests that would add to the ones in other African oil producing nations like Sudan and Algeria.  Under the 2019/2020 budget bill—which needs parliament approval to become law—Egypt plans to further slash fuel and electricity subsidies, by 40.5 percent for fuel and by 75 percent for electricity, in the financial year 2019-2020, Middle East Monitor reports, citing the Egyptian finance ministry.Egypt, which has been heavily borrowing from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in recent years to prop up its ailing economy, has promised to cut subsidies in order to continue receiving international financial support. However, the fuel subsidies mean that many Egyptians are struggling with the higher prices of gasoline, diesel, and other fuels, and can’t afford many necessities amid rising inflation.



In the middle of last year, Egypt hiked gasoline prices by up to 50 percent, as it is seeking to meet reform requirements for funds extended by the IMF, but the gradual removal of the fuel subsidies has made ordinary Egyptians angry with austerity measures.After the subsidy cuts last year, Egyptians took to Twitter to demand that their president Abdel Fattah al-Sisi resign.The upcoming round of another fuel subsidy cuts in Egypt could stir dissent and spark protests in yet another African country with oil and gas reserves.



Over the past weeks, protests in Algeria and Sudan have resulted in the two countries’ respective long-term presidents leaving office.Algeria’s president of 20 years, Abdelaziz Bouteflika, stepped down at the beginning of April, following weeks of protests.A week later, Omar al-Bashir, who had ruled Egypt’s neighbor to the south, Sudan, since 1989, was toppled from power by the military and placed under “heavy guard”, following months of protests against the government and its handling of a severe economic crisis in the country.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:“It’s Stupid”: German Professor Slams Berlin Battery PlayScientists Find Oil-Eating Superbacteria On Bottom Of The OceanCould This Be The Next High Profile Permian Takeover?

Saudi Arabia’s oil giant Aramco is in “serious discussions” to buy up to 25 percent of the refining and petrochemicals businesses of India’s largest company, Reliance Industries, The Times of India reported on Wednesday, citing people with knowledge of the developments.Aramco first showed interest in Reliance’s downstream business four months ago, but discussions have sped up since Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman visited India in February, according to The Times of India.  The two sides could reach an agreement on the value of a possible deal around June, the Indian outlet’s sources said. A stake of 25 percent could fetch around US$10 billion-US$15 billion for Reliance, which would value the Indian company’s total refining and petrochemicals business at some US$55 billion-US$60 billion.



In recent years, Saudi Arabia has been pursuing downstream deals in Asia—the most prized market for oil exporting nations, aiming to lock in future demand for Saudi crude oil. India, for its part, is a fast-growing demand center and the world’s third-largest oil consumer after the U.S. and China.During the visit of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to India two months ago, Saudi Arabia announced plans to invest US$100 billion in India’s infrastructure and energy industry as it seeks to strengthen its position in the country.Related: The U.S. Is Losing Influence In The World’s Biggest Oil RegionIndia is an investment priority for Saudi Aramco, the chief executive of the Saudi oil giant Amin Nasser said in New Delhi in February, noting that Aramco is in talks with Reliance Industries for potential investments and is looking at other opportunities as well.



In June last year, Saudi Aramco and the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) signed a framework agreement and a memorandum of understanding with a consortium of Indian national oil companies to join a project for a mega refinery and petrochemical complex in India worth US$44 billion. However, the huge project has faced setbacks because farmers have been unwilling to give up their land for the site of the plant, and earlier this week the Maharashtra state announced that the project would be relocated to another site.Earlier this week, Aramco said that its subsidiary Aramco Overseas Company would buy 17 percent in South Korea’s Hyundai Oilbank for around US$1.25 billion, an investment that “will support Saudi Aramco’s crude oil placement strategy by providing a dedicated outlet for Arabian crude oil to South Korea.” By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Think Tank: Mexico’s New Refinery Already DoomedCould This Be The Next High Profile Permian Takeover?Scientists Find Oil-Eating Superbacteria On Bottom Of The Ocean

The President of Venezuela’s National Assembly and opposition leader Juan Guaido will try to win an annulment for an US$8.7-billion compensation awarded to U.S. supermajor ConocoPhillips by an arbitration court for the forced nationalization of the company’s Venezuelan business by the Hugo Chavez government.This is what Guaido’s chief legal representative said as quoted by Reuters, adding that his team also plans to dispute the size of the compensation, which was awarded to Conoco by the World Bank’s International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes. It is the largest compensation for asset nationalization in Venezuela awarded by a court, but not the only one, as several companies are suing Caracas for taking their business away from them.



Conoco, however, does not seem willing to follow Washington’s lead and help Guaido take the reins in Venezuela. A company spokesperson told Reuters that Guaido’s team’s request for annulment bore no merit and added that the company would “strongly defend” itself in case such a request was made.Conoco’s opposition to any potential annulment is not the only problem Guaido’s team is facing. As Reuters notes, the World Bank has yet to recognize Juan Guaido as the legal leader of Venezuela before his team of lawyers can make any requests for annulments of compensation rulings.



Guaido declared himself interim president of Venezuela in January following the inauguration of incumbent Nicolas Maduro for his second term in office. The opposition leader based his declaration on the constitution, calling for new elections. Three months later, there is little Guaido can show for his efforts, except continuing but sporadic protests that evidently lack the strength to oust Maduro and his government.More than two dozen governments have recognized him as the legitimate, albeit interim, leader of Venezuela, and Washington has granted him control over Citgo, PDVSA’s U.S. business, but this, too, has failed to strengthen the opposition enough to overthrow the government.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads from Oilprice.com:‘High’ Oil Prices Are Already Dampening DemandThe Case For $100 OilU.S. Doubles Oil Exports In 2018

The United Conservative Party won the provincial vote in Alberta with an overwhelming majority, promising a harder line on energy issues as a champion for the oil industry.The leader, Jason Kenney, pledged on the campaign trail to remove the carbon tax introduced in the oil province and challenge legislation that neighbor British Columbia is pushing that would give it more power over inter-province infrastructure projects. The goal is to stop for good the Trans Mountain oil pipeline expansion project.The UCP victory spells more trouble for the two neighboring provinces if Kenney stays true to his promises. It also spells more tension between Alberta and Ottawa, as the UCP leader has also vowed to get the federal government in line regarding the now-notorious project.



In addition, Kenney has said he planned to hold a referendum in Alberta regarding the so-called equalization payments the federal government distributes to smoothen financial inequalities among provinces. Plans are to tie these payments to the construction of new pipelines.The pipeline problem has become Alberta’s Achilles’ heel, costing it billions in lost profits from crude oil exports as production grows but existing pipelines cannot cope with the additional load. This has spurred more exports by rail and the acquisition by the outgoing Rachel Notley government of more rail cars to boost the export capacity in the face of pipeline bottlenecks.The shortage also forced the government to institute obligatory production cuts that met with strong opposition from some industry players and may have additionally tipped the scales in favor of the United Conservative Party in the election.



Canadian media report that Kenney has already threatened British Columbia to turn the gasoline tap off “within an hour” of taking office if it continues to try and stop the Trans Mountain expansion. This might very well be the first shot in the second inter-province Battle of the Pipelines.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Scientists Find Oil-Eating Superbacteria On Bottom Of The OceanCould This Be The Next High Profile Permian Takeover?Oil Rebounds On Bullish Inventory Data

Iranian oil exports have dropped this month as waivers are soon set to expire, Refinitiv Eikon and tanker tracking data showed, according to Reuters. The United States is set to decide on new waivers—if there will be any—on May 2.Iranian oil exports were on track in March to fall from January and February levels as countries that were granted that waiver the first time were unsure they would get a second one. But a rash of last-minute buying set Iran’s March exports near the previous months’ levels as waiver-holders sought to get shipments in under the wire.



January and February exports from Iran were higher than many thought they would be, between 1.1 and 1.3 million bpd. Estimates for March exports, according to Reuters, is 1.1 million bpd, but April’s exports so far are below 1 million bpd—precisely where the Untied States wanted Iran’s exports to be by May.Earlier in April, US special envoy for Iran, Brian Hook, told Reuters that three of Iran’s biggest oil importers had stopped buying crude oil in April ahead of the waiver expiration. While Hook didn’t say which of the waiver holders had stopped buying oil from Iran completely, those three are likely somewhat responsible for the figures being reported today.



Several countries including South Korea and Japan had stopped buying Iranian oil altogether before the sanctions went into effect last November as US allies look to adhere to the sanctions. This time around, Japan is still proceeding cautiously, saying that Japanese refiners were unlikely to continue buying crude from April onwards—that is, unless the US grated it a waiver extension.The United States is likely to extend some of the waivers in order to avoid price shock in the oil markets, although the volume allowed under new waivers will likely be less as the United States looks to get closer to zero Iranian oil exports.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Oil Could Fall To $40 If OPEC Abandons Its DealRed Hot Permian Set To Jolt U.S. Shale Output To New RecordCould This Be The Next High Profile Permian Takeover?

The American Petroleum Institute (API) reported a draw in crude oil inventory of 3.096 million barrels for the week ending April 12, coming in over analyst expectations of a ­1.711-million-barrel build.Last week, the API reported a build in crude oil of 4.1 million barrels. A day later, the EIA confirmed the build, with a report of a 7-million-barrel buildup in inventory. Including this week’s data, the net build is now 4.44 million barrels for the 16-week reporting period so far this year, using API data.

Independent Russian oil and gas producer Irkutsk Oil Company (INK), which has Goldman Sachs as a shareholder, stands out in the state firm-dominated sector in Russia and plans to invest billions of U.S. dollars to develop its gas processing business and boost oil production.In 2013, Goldman Sachs International became a shareholder with a 3.75 percent stake in INK. The Irkutsk-based oil firm focuses on the geological study, exploration, and production of crude oil, condensate, and natural gas in the Irkutsk region and the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) in eastern Siberia.Last September, INK’s chairman and COO Nikolay Buynov met with representatives of the senior leadership of Goldman Sachs to discuss partnership opportunities, including the construction of a gas chemical plant, Irkutsk Polymer Plant, with planned production of 650,000 tons of polyethylene, INK said.



Unlike most of the large Russian oil companies, INK has boosted its crude oil production in recent years and plans to invest between US$3 billion and US$4 billion in the next three years in building gas processing plants, the company told Reuters reporter Olesya Astakhova.Sure, INK’s crude oil production is tiny compared to that of oil giant Rosneft, but the Irkutsk company has been bucking the trend in Russia’s oil industry in recent years where the sector dominated by large companies have been sluggish to increase output, even before the OPEC/non-OPEC deal capped Russia’s oil production.  The OPEC+ deal has come at a good time for the company, INK’s head of oil production Dmitry Zotov told Reuters.



“The OPEC deal has given us a chance to stop and draw breath,” Zotov said.INK benefits from the fact that it is not under Western sanctions like some of the major energy companies in Russia. The downside of operating in eastern Siberia, however, is harsh weather in remote locations and shortage of skilled staff, Reuters notes.

Iran has shut down some oil fields in its southwest Khuzestan province bordering Iraq and the Persian Gulf, as the Islamic Republic is looking to control the damage from recent flash floods that have cost it billions of U.S. dollars.Iran shut down last week oil fields in Khuzestan as it tries to control the damage and prevent an environmental disaster, the National Iranian Oil Co (NIOC) said in a press release, citing Oil Minister Bijan Zangeneh.Iran has had some pipelines in the province emptied for the first time, while oil production has been reduced in some flood-hit areas as a precaution, Zangeneh said, stressing that crude production in the Khuzestan province had not been completely stopped.



“Currently all oil wells in the West Karoun region are flooded or surrounded by water except for a protected area of hundreds of meters around the wells,” Zangeneh said.The floods in recent weeks have killed more than 70 people, destroyed thousands of homes, and forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek emergency shelter. According to Iranian lawmakers cited by state media and Reuters, the floods caused the equivalent of US$2.5 billion in damages to road infrastructure and agricultural land.The floods in Iran and the shutdown of some oil production as a precaution come at a time when Iran’s oil industry and exports are under U.S. sanctions that have been limiting the Islamic Republic’s exports to 1.1 million bpd-1.3 million bpd in recent months—around half of Iran’s crude oil exports at this time last year, before the U.S. announced its withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal and re-imposed sanctions on Iranian oil in November.   



The U.S. waivers for eight key Iranian oil customers, including China, India, Japan, and South Korea, expire in early May. While the U.S. Administration says that it continues to pursue zero Iranian oil exports, analysts expect Washington to extend waivers to at least a few of the currently exempted buyers, with reduced volumes allowed under the new waivers, as the Administration may be leery of pushing oil prices too high.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Environmentalists’ “Bomb Train” Concerns Are OverblownOil Prices Snap Winning Streak“It’s Stupid”: German Professor Slams Berlin Battery Play

The State of Washington’s House of Representatives has just passed a bill to reduce vapor pressure limits on crude-by-rail shipments through the state. If the bill becomes law, analysts say that it could create cost barriers for Bakken oil producers to ship their oil to the Pacific Northwest and could increase Washington State’s imports of crude from sources other than North Dakota, such as Alaska and Asia.Washington’s House of Representatives approved on Friday an amended bill saying that “A facility may not load or unload crude oil into or from a rail tank car unless the oil has a vapor pressure of less than 9 pounds per square inch beginning two years after the volume of crude oil transported by rail to the facility for a calendar year has increased by more than 10 percent above the volume reported for the 2018 calendar year.”  According to the Capitol Crude podcast of S&P Global Platts, featuring Brian Scheid, the bill could stop completely 150,000 bpd of Bakken crude by rail traffic into the state of Washington. More than 90 percent of Washington’s crude-by-rail traffic originates in North Dakota, Scheid said.



Another potential change in oil flows could be increased tanker traffic through Puget Sound as Washington’s five refineries could turn to other crude if Bakken flows are stymied by the new vapor pressure limits. Washington’s imports of crude oil from Alaska and Asia could increase, while North Dakota’s producers could start looking to boost their shipments to the U.S. Gulf Coast if they can’t ship their crude to Washington, Scheid said.Related: The Case For $100 OilWashington State is not a crude oil producing state, but it has the fifth largest U.S. oil refining capacity, with the ability to process 638,000 bpd, according to EIA data. “If passed, this regulation would bring Bakken crude rail shipments to a halt, negatively impacting not only Washington’s economy, but also North Dakota, Montana, and others,” George Jamerson, the Director of Government Relations at The Heartland Institute, wrote in a commentary last week. 



The new vapor pressure limit of less than 9 pounds per square inch (psi) is well below the current 13.7 psi established by regulators in 2015 and the national standard of 14.7, Jamerson argues.“This would create a considerable cost barrier for producers, as they would not only need to invest in new and expensive equipment to reach this pressure level, they would also be forced to remove certain qualities of the crude, making it less valuable to refiners,” he wrote.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Environmentalists’ “Bomb Train” Concerns Are OverblownOil Prices Snap Winning Streak“It’s Stupid”: German Professor Slams Berlin Battery Play

New registrations of fully electric vehicles (EVs) in the United States hit a record 208,000 cars in 2018, more than double the new registrations in 2017, business intelligence firm IHS Markit said in a new analysis.Loyalty rates among EV owners also grew last year, as almost 55 percent of all new EV owners returned to buy or lease another EV in the fourth quarter of 2018, up from the 42 percent of new owners who returned to purchase an EV in the third quarter, IHS Markit said.  “As more new models enter the market, we anticipate an even further increase in loyalty to these vehicles,” Tom Libby, loyalty principal at IHS Markit, said, commenting on the analysis.



Unsurprisingly, 59 percent of new EV registrations last year were in California and other states that have adopted zero emission vehicle (ZEV) standards, IHS Markit said. California alone accounted for almost 46 percent of all new EV registrations in the U.S. last year with 95,000 EV registrations.The other ZEV states that added to California to help drive EV registrations last year include Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, and Vermont, the intelligence firm noted.  Going forward, IHS Markit expects that new EVs sales in the United States will exceed 350,000 units in 2020, accounting for 2 percent of America’s car fleet. Further out in time, in 2025, new EV sales in the U.S. are forecast to jump to more than 1.1 million for a market share of 7 percent.Related: Megadeal Triggers M&A Spree In The Permian



“While relatively successful models such as the Tesla Model 3 mature in the market, other traditional automakers will be rolling out not just one EV as we have seen in the past, but multiple models off dedicated EV platforms,” Devin Lindsay, IHS Markit powertrain analyst, said.However, IHS Markit sees one potential great headwind for EV sales in the U.S.—an elimination or delay of California’s ZEV mandate by the federal government, as proposed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).The EV market will grow in the United States and in the world, the analysis says, but adds that one thing is clear: “the internal combustion engine is not going away any time soon, with IHS Markit forecasters anticipating them to continue to dominate the global market until past 2030.” By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Environmentalists’ “Bomb Train” Concerns Are OverblownOil Prices Snap Winning Streak“It’s Stupid”: German Professor Slams Berlin Battery Play

Tesla has announced it has developed a unique battery recycling system at its Nevada gigafactory that can maximize the recovery of critical battery minerals including lithium and cobalt, the company said in its 2018 Impact Report.According to the report, “Through this system, the recovery of critical minerals such as lithium and cobalt will be maximized along with the recovery of all metals used in the battery cell, such as copper, aluminum and steel. All of these materials will be recovered in forms optimized for new battery material production.”



The battery recycling problem that the world is facing has come to light only recently as sales of electric vehicles pick up strongly and as forecasts almost invariably point to an acceleration of this trend in the years to come. Since batteries don’t have an infinite life, this means the battery load for recycling will also increase substantially, which has sparked a race in recycling technologies.Earlier this year, a Finnish company, for example, announced that it had reached a recycling rate of 80 percent for EV batteries using a hydrometallurgical recycling process with a low CO2 footprint. According to the company, Fortum, the technology could be used for all industries using batteries.



The battery recycling market could reach a size of about US$23 billion a year by 2025 thanks to the increased adoption of EVs, Reuters noted in a recent report on the topic. This makes recycling technologies that can recover most of the metals and minerals used in lithium ion batteries all the hotter given that recycling is much easier on the environment in terms of carbon emissions than the mining of new minerals to be used in new batteries.As per the Tesla report, “The closed-loop battery recycling process at Gigafactory 1 presents a compelling solution to move energy supply away from the fossil-fuel based practice of take, make and burn, to a more circular model of recycling end-of-life batteries for reuse over and over again.”By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:U.S. Energy Consumption Hits All-Time RecordThe Case For $100 OilMegadeal Triggers M&A Spree In The Permian

The Nigerian army has destroyed one of the biggest illegal oil camps in the Niger Delta controlled and operated by oil thieves, local media report. The soldiers, according to the reports, destroyed 700 oil drums, 150 storage tanks, and some sixty boats.Nigeria’s authorities are still fighting illicit oil trade with crude stolen from pipelines in the Delta, which has been the cause of many leaks and spills, although the local communities have blamed these on oilfield operators.There were more than 12,000 spills in the Niger Delta between 1976 and 2014. More than half of these were caused by pipeline corrosion and tanker accidents. The rest were a result of mechanical error and sabotage, the Journal of Health and Pollution reported last year.



Oil companies have blamed most spills and pipeline leaks on sabotage and vandalism: cutting into pipelines to siphon fuel is not an uncommon practice in the Delta. It has in fact fueled a whole illicit refining industry in the region that the government has tried tackling in various ways, from violent shutdowns to, most recently, negotiations to bring the illegal refineries out from the shadow economy.In 2017, according to Shell’s sustainability report released last year, oil theft resulted in losses of around 9,000 bpd , more than the 6,000 bpd lost in 2016, but less than the rate of 25,000-bpd loss in 2015.“The increase in 2017 can in part be explained by the militant-induced shutdown of the Forcados export terminal in 2016, which reduced opportunities for third party interference,” Shell said in the report, released in April 2018.



This year, the authorities in the state of Bayelsa, in the Delta, set up a panel to investigate spills in the region in a bid to tighten control over oilfield operators, which the local communities still consider ultimately responsible for the accidents.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads from Oilprice.com:Chevron To Buy Anadarko In $33B DealMegadeal Triggers M&A Spree In The PermianThe Secret Oil Plan That's Critical To Trump’s Reelection

Gazprom has begun buying natural gas from Turkmenistan after a three-year pause, under a 25-year contract signed in 2003 and suspended in 2016.Until 2010, Russia’s gas giant was the biggest buyer of Turkmen gas, Reuters recalls in its report on the story, adding that this was the year when Turkmenistan began exporting gas to China. This must not have sat well with Gazprom, for whom China is a major target market, so the company began reducing its intake of Turkmen gas.However, the exports to China were not the biggest problem. In 2015, Turkmengaz, Gazprom’s counterpart in Turkmenistan, accused the Russian company of owing payments for gas deliveries. It even declared Gazprom insolvent, to which the Russian major responded with a lawsuit, in which it insisted that the prices it paid for Turkmen gas be reviewed. It also demanded a compensation of US$5 billion alleging it had overpaid for the gas.



A year later, Gazprom completely stopped buying Turkmen gas and switched to Uzbekistan as gas supplier instead.As of 2010, Gazprom imported between 40 and 50 billion cubic meters of gas from Turkmenistan. To date, the Central Asian country produces around 70 billion cubic meters, of which 40 billion cubic meters are exported to China.Turkmenistan has natural gas reserves estimated at 265 trillion cu ft, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. This makes it the sixth-largest gas reserves holder globally. However, Turkmenistan has yet to reap the full benefits of its oil wealth. The country lacks the transport infrastructure that would make it a player to reckon with on international markets.



Still, investments are on the rise and besides the Turkmenistan-China gas pipeline, which is the largest gas export pipeline in Central Asia, the country is also part of the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India (TAPI) pipeline project. The pipeline is scheduled to start operating next year at a rate of 33 billion cubic meters annually.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Environmentalists’ “Bomb Train” Concerns Are OverblownOil Prices Snap Winning Streak“It’s Stupid”: German Professor Slams Berlin Battery Play

Presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren has promised, in a column on Medium, to ban all fossil fuel extractions on all federal lands and coastal waters. This move will no doubt generate some name recognition that may separate Warren from other democrat candidates seeking to win the 2020 Democrat Party primaries.The federal land in question constitutes 25 percent of total land in the United States, Warren claims in her post, and is worthy of protection. “The Trump administration is busy selling off our public lands to the oil, gas and coal industries for pennies on the dollar—expanding fossil fuel extraction that destroys pristine sites across the country while pouring an accelerant on our climate crisis” Warren’s post reads.



“That’s why on my first day as president, I will sign an executive order that says no more drilling—a total moratorium on fossil fuel leases, including for drilling offshore and on public lands.”This promise is noteworthy considering that a court ruled earlier this month that while a sitting U.S. president has the authority to protect lands from exploring and drilling activities, they do not have the authority to reinstate those lands with an executive order. Rather, lifting a ban would require congressional approval, according to the U.S. District Court for the District of Alaska judge Sharon L. Gleason in her ruling. That ruling will likely be appealed and could drag on for years to come.



Warren’s stance on fossil fuels is in stark contrast to the United States under President Donald Trump, which saw a flurry of oil and gas drilling permits issued in 2018.Warren’s position is not only drastically different than President Trump’s position on fossil fuels, but it’s a step or two further than the rest of her presidential hopeful peers—most of whom support the Green New Deal but stop shy of promoting a full-scale ban.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Brent Could Hit $80 This Summer As Hedge Funds Lose SteamArtificial Intelligence Is Transforming Oil TradePermian Takes The Crown As World’s Top Oil Field

Oil flow from South Sudan has not been affected by the political turmoil in its neighbor to the north, Sudan, the oil minister of South Sudan, Ezekiel Lul Gatkuoth, has told Reuters.Last week, Omar al-Bashir, long-term President of Sudan, was toppled from power by the military and placed under “heavy guard”, following months of protests against the government and its handling of a severe economic crisis in the country.Sudan’s Defense Minister Awad Mohamed Ahmed Ibn Auf said that there would be a two-year transition period of military rule and a council governing the country. Presidential elections will be held after the transition period expires.



Sudan, a relatively small African oil producer, has been plagued by economic hardships since South Sudan seceded in 2011. South Sudan broke from Sudan that year and took with it around 350,000 bpd in oil production.After South Sudan’s secession from Sudan, the two countries have been mutually dependent on oil revenues, because the south has 75 percent of the oil reserves, while the north has the only current transport route for the oil to international markets.After the coup in Sudan, oil flows normally from South Sudan as of Saturday, minister Gatkuoth said.



“The technical teams from both sides in South Sudan and Sudan are cooperating very well and nothing is alarming at all,” he told Reuters.Earlier this year, Gatkuoth said that South Sudan was looking to pump more than 350,000 bpd of oil by the middle of next year, compared to current production levels of around 140,000 bpd.By the end of 2019, South Sudan expects its oil production to nearly double from the current 140,000 bpd to 270,000 bpd, Gatkuoth told Reuters in February this year. By the middle of 2020, the country aims to restore production to the pre-civil war levels, he noted.

The poorest nation in the Western hemisphere has seen its fuel supply increasingly challenged since a program designed by Venezuela to supply fuel and gain influence in the Caribbean collapsed last year amid the raging Venezuelan crisis.  Haiti had received almost 70 percent of its fuel from Venezuela at the peak of the so-called Petrocaribe program, under which Venezuela offered very attractive financing to Caribbean nations to buy its refined oil products.However, after the Petrocaribe program collapsed last year, Haiti was forced to turn to international markets for its fuel supply. But without the Petrocaribe financing for oil, the Caribbean nation has been struggling to find enough U.S. dollars to pay for the product deliveries, and suppliers aren’t having it.Physical oil supply and trading company Novum Energy Trading Corp suspended earlier this year fuel cargoes bound for Haiti because of overdue payments—and this has exacerbated the fuel and energy crisis in the Caribbean country.



Novum had been supplying fuels to Haiti via the Bureau of Monetization of Programs and Development Aid (BMPAD) for more than four years.“In recent months, regretfully the payment performance of BMPAD has deteriorated significantly,” Novum Energy’s chief financial officer Chris Scott said in a statement in January 2019.Earlier this month, Novum Energy updated the market on its operations in Haiti, saying that payments are “coming few and far between.”Although Novum Energy has received a small portion of the overdue and outstanding invoices, “the remaining US$39.7m of overdue invoices are now 60 days late (which is on top of the 45 days of open credit Novum grants BMPAD),” it said.  



Because of the lack of regular payments, Novum’s vessel MT Nord Innovation, carrying 150,000 barrels of gasoline, has remained outside of Haiti since February 27, “awaiting payments and a formal schedule of when we can expect to receive the remaining amounts outstanding,” Scott said on April 4.Meanwhile, Haiti has been gripped in 2019 by anti-government protests, with protesters demanding investigations into alleged misuse of the funds from the Petrocaribe program, among other things.

Iraq is set to build an oil refinery of 150,000 bpd processing capacity in the northern city of Kirkuk, according to Iraqi Oil Minister Thamer Ghadhban.  The ministry said that it had “put the final touches” on building the refinery in Kirkuk, which will have a capacity of 150,000 barrels per day, Ghadhban said in a statement on Monday after visiting Kirkuk, according to Reuters.Several Iraqi ministers visited Kirkuk this weekend to meet the governor of the province and discuss new projects and plans that have stalled, some of which were in the oil and electricity sectors.



Oil minister Ghadhban stressed the importance of Kirkuk to the Iraqi federal government.  Last November, Iraq resumed oil exports from the Kirkuk province, a year after it had stopped oil flows from the area due to a dispute with the semi-autonomous Kurdistan region.Around 300,000 bpd of crude oil previously pumped and exported in the Kirkuk province to the Turkish port of Ceyhan were shut in when the Iraqi federal government moved in October 2017 to take control over the oil fields in Kirkuk from Kurdish forces after the semi-autonomous region held a referendum that Baghdad didn’t recognize. However, the only export outlet of the Kirkuk oil is the oil pipeline of the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG). The Iraqi federal government and the KRG had been in talks for months to try to reach an agreement on resuming Iraqi exports from Kirkuk.



Weeks before the resumption of the Iraqi oil exports from the Kirkuk province, the Kurdistan region said that it had upgraded its oil export pipeline, boosting its capacity to 1 million bpd from 700,000 bpd, to accommodate future production growth from the region.“This extra capacity will accommodate future production growth from KRG producing fields, and can also be used by the federal government to export the currently stranded oil in Kirkuk and surrounding areas,” KRG’s ministry said in a statement on November 4.

South Korea’s imports of Iranian crude last month reached 1.2 million tons, or 8.8 million barrels which was a 23-percent increase on February and a fivefold increase in January, when Korean refiners resumed their purchases of Iranian crude.Reuters reports the daily intake rate for March was a bit above 280,000 barrels, which on an annual basis represents a 12-percent decline. This is understandable as this time last year the U.S. and not yet reinstated sanctions against Tehran and everyone was buying its oil without concern.Now, however, South Korea and Japan are being extra careful: both countries suspended their purchases of Iranian crude ahead of the return of sanctions last November and then waited for two months before they resumed their buying of Iranian oil even though they were granted a sanction waiver.



The waivers, also granted to India and China, among others, expire in May, and South Korea and Japan are already negotiating a waiver extension despite Washington’s stated goal of reducing Iran’s oil exports to zero. According to the latest updates from U.S. officials, the administration will seek to achieve this goal gradually to avoid a shock to the market that would cause a jump in prices.When the current waivers expire, sources told Reuters, the next intermediate goal will be to cut Iran’s exports to below 1 million bpd, or by 20 percent from the estimated May rate.South Korea was allowed under the sanction waiver to continue importing 200,000 bpd until May. If it scores a waiver extension, this amount will probably be reduced.



Earlier this month, the U.S. special envoy for Iran, Brian Hook, told Reuters that three of Iran’s biggest oil importers had stopped buying crude in April ahead of the sanction waiver expiration, although he did not name any of the three. This suspension explains the increased rate of Iranian oil intake in March, with both Korean and Japanese refiners buying as much as they can before the waiver expires without compromising their countries’ good standing with Washington.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Environmentalists’ “Bomb Train” Concerns Are OverblownChevron To Buy Anadarko In $33B DealThe Secret Oil Plan That's Critical To Trump’s Reelection

Just two months after he tweeted a production figure forecast, Tesla’s chief executive has done it again just days after he had to appear in court because the Securities and Exchange Commission accused him of violating an agreement to first ask the board of directors for approval of any tweets that might move Tesla stock.Bloomberg reports that the tweet comes amid concern about the future performance of the company after reports that Tesla and Panasonic were shelving their plans to expand the production capacity of the Nevada gigafactory.



The tweet was actually a reply to another network user’s tweet in a discussion regarding the future value of electric cars and Tesla's in particular. However, if the SEC is watching Musk as closely as its reaction to his previous tweet suggests, chances are it will again try to get him in line with the help of the court system.The financial markets regulator in February asked a judge to hold Elon Musk in contempt for violating a deal the regulator struck with the Tesla chief executive last year, which requires him to get the approval of the Tesla board of directors before tweeting anything that could “be material to investors.”



The tweet that prompted the SEC move said that Tesla will manufacture half a million cars this year. The tweet, however, was quickly followed by another one, clarifying that “Meant to say annualized production rate at end of 2019 probably around 500k, ie 10k cars/week. Deliveries for year still estimated to be about 400k.” The judge was not impressed, however, and told both sides to “Take a deep breath, put your reasonableness pants on, and work this out,” giving them until this Thursday to settle their differences out of court. If they fail to do so, Judge Alison Nathan will rule on the contempt charge.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Chevron To Buy Anadarko In $33B DealThe Secret Oil Plan That's Critical To Trump’s ReelectionBP Pulls Out Of China’s Shale Patch

India’s oil imports from Iran increased by some 5 percent between March 2018 and March 2019 compared to the previous fiscal year through March 2018, because Indian refiners rushed to buy Iranian oil before the U.S. sanctions kicked in in November and hurried to wind up purchases ahead of the waiver expiring early next month.  According to preliminary data for tanker arrivals, obtained by Reuters from industry and shipping sources, India’s imports of Iranian oil rose to around 479,500 bpd in the 2018/2019 Indian fiscal year ended last month, compared to some 458,000 bpd that Indian refiners imported in the 2017/2018 fiscal year. Between April and October 2018, India’s refiners were buying more than usual Iranian oil because none of Iran’s oil customers were certain that it would get a U.S. sanctions waiver to continue purchases from Iran after the sanctions were re-imposed in early November 2018. Another major reason for increased Indian buying of Iranian oil before November was that Iran was offering very attractive terms to Indian buyers, including almost free shipping and an extended credit period for payment.  



India—alongside seven other Iranian oil customers including the biggest buyer China—received a U.S. waiver to continue buying Iranian oil, at a rate of around 300,000 bpd. Although not all Indian refiners continued purchases because private companies with exposure to the U.S. financial system were wary of secondary sanctions if they buy oil from Iran, India used up its 300,000 bpd quota allowed under the current exemption.According to the data obtained by Reuters, India’s imports of Iranian oil jumped to 405,000 bpd in March 2019, up by 56 percent from February 2019.Refiners want to make sure they wind down payments before the waivers expire, while a shortage of ships moved some cargo loadings to the end of February with arrival in India in March.



India is not booking Iranian oil due to load in May, as refiners are waiting for more clarity from the U.S. on whether India will get its sanctions waiver extended, Reuters reported earlier this week, citing four sources.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Decline In U.S. Oil Rigs Sends WTI HigherIs This The End Of The OPEC Deal?BP Pulls Out Of China’s Shale Patch

Just a week after the United States levied additional sanctions on Venezuela in an effort to curb its oil exports, the US has again hit shipping companies doing business with Venezuela with even more sanctions aimed at further plugging the holes that allow Venezuela to export crude oil to Cuba.This go around, the US targeted four shipping companies and nine vessels in its latest attempt to cut off the revenue stream of what the US Department of the Treasury refers to as “the illegitimate regime of former President Nicolas Maduro”.Those entities include Jennifer Navigation Ltd (Liberia), Lime Shipping Corp (Liberia), Large Range Ltd (Liberia), and PB Tankers S.P.A. (Italy).



“As a result of today’s action, all property and interests in property of these entities, and of any entities that are owned, directly or indirectly, 50 percent or more by the designated entities, that are in the United States or in the possession or control of U.S. persons are blocked “ the Treasury statement read in part.The move comes after reports surfaced earlier on Friday that Venezuela was still shipping crude oil to ally Cuba in the amount of 1 million barrels just days after the US levied sanctions on Venezuela-to-Cuba oil shipments in what is quickly becoming a weekly Little Dutch Boy event.The close-knit ties between ideological allies Cuba and Venezuela is proving more complicated that earlier sanctions that targeted shipments from Venezuela to the United States and its allies.



Officially recognized by the United States as the rightful president of Venezuela, Juan Guaido last month said that he had decreed the suspension of crude oil shipments to Cuba, but Maduro is particularly motivated to ship oil to Cuba under a long-standing barter agreement dating back to the Chavez/Castro days that ships oil to Cuba in exchange for highly skilled labor that Cuba possesses. Venezuela is Cuba’s largest oil supplier, and Cuba one of Venezuela’s few remaining friends.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Is This The End Of The OPEC Deal?Chevron To Buy Anadarko In $33B DealDecline In U.S. Oil Rigs Sends WTI Higher

Protests in Algeria continued on Friday, more than a week after Algeria’s president of 20 years, Abdelaziz Bouteflika, stepped down from the top office, with protesters angered at the interim leadership in the OPEC member and demanding total political change.Following weeks of huge nationwide protests, Algeria’s President of 20 years, Abdelaziz Bouteflika, stepped down last week.Mass protests across Algeria erupted several weeks ago when Bouteflika announced he would run for a fifth term as president. Those protests forced him to rescind that decision, but the momentum against him failed to subside. Instead, it had increased and intended to do so until he steps down entirely.



Now Algerians show that they want more changes in the country’s leadership and demanded that interim president, Abdelkader Bensalah, seen as a part of the regime, resign.Algeria’s oil and gas future now looks uncertain amid the political crisis as state-run oil company Sonatrach is once again under scrutiny for alleged corruption and as major international oil companies suspended talks on projects in the country.Oil majors are reeling from the crisis in Algeria that first saw Exxon halt its prospective shale ambitions, and has now spread to major trading houses.



Earlier this week, Sonatrach shuttered plans for a trading joint venture just as it was about to choose a partner from among trading giants Vitol, Gunvor, French Total, and Italian Eni. Last month, The Wall Street Journal reported that Exxon, BP, and Norway’s Equinor had all put the brakes on investment plans for the North African country amid escalating protests. Exxon was about to sign a preliminary deal for a trading joint venture with Sonatrach, and BP and Equinor both have a long-standing presence in the country—both with new investment intentions that were put on hold.Algeria’s oil and gas sector accounts for 85 percent of all of the OPEC country’s exports, according to OPEC, and accounts for 20 percent of the country’s gross domestic product.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Decline In U.S. Oil Rigs Sends WTI HigherGoldman: Oil Prices Won’t Reach $80President Of African Oil Producer Sudan Toppled In Military Coup

Libya’s oil production is under threat from renewed fighting between warring armed groups and the situation could become as bad as it was during the 2011 civil war, the National Oil Corporation’s chairman, Mustafa Sanalla, told the Financial Times in an interview.“I am afraid the situation could be much worse than 2011 because of the size of forces now involved,” Sanalla told the FT, adding “Unless the problem is solved very quickly, I am afraid this will affect our operations, and soon we will not be able to produce oil or gas.” The flare-up of inter-group violence took many by surprise as it came after comments from the commander of the Libyan National Army, General Khalifa Haftar that soon Libya will have a single government. The LNA is affiliated with the eastern government that the UN has not recognized but some took the comments to mean negotiations are on the table.



Instead of negotiations, the LNA advanced on Tripoli. Since then, fighting has been intensifying with no end of the violence in sight.Sanalla called on the international community to step in and put an end to the violence but options are limited amid the deep division between warring factions, all of which are seeking control over the country’s oil.“The oil production must remain uninterrupted. If we lost 1.2m barrels a day of production at this time you cannot imagine what the global price would do,” Sanalla said in the interview. Libya depends on its oil and gas exports for more than 95 percent of its exports and the consequences of the conflict spreading to oil and gas fields will in all likelihood be disastrous for an economy still reeling from the fallout of a bloody civil war.



The EU, which recognizes the Government of National Accord based in Tripoli, yesterday issued an official statement urging the sides in the conflict to stop the violence.

European refiners are switching to Russian sour grades as U.S. sanctions have shrunk Venezuela’s similar-grade exports, Reuters reports, adding that the Russian sour crude is getting increasingly expensive.Citing sources from the trading industry, Reuters says the situation has been made worse by the fact that OPEC members have cut mainly their output of heavier, more sour grades under the OPEC+ agreement aimed at stimulating a price rise.U.S. crude is not an alternative as it is overwhelmingly light and sweet, while refineries in Europe are equipped to process heavier grades as well as light ones to make refined products.



The news is the latest reminder that the world is tipping towards a shortage of heavy, sour crude, which is the staple kind of Venezuela crude and which many refineries need to produce fuels and other products.“Urals is anchored in a positive zone versus dated Brent and there is no indication it will fall to a discount any time soon,” one of the Reuters’ sources said. That’s a complete reversal of the traditional differential between light and heavy oil, with the latter typically trading at a discount to Brent, a light blend.Sanctions on Iran are further complicating life for European refiners as they have restricted exports of sour grades that Iran also produces in addition to its very popular superlight crude, also called condensate.



According to Reuters, U.S. sanctions have removed 800,000 bpd of heavy crude from the global market, leaving refiners scrambling for alternatives in a limited pool that, besides Russia and Middle Eastern producers, also includes Canada and Mexico as large producers of these grades of crude. The former is having its own problems with a pipeline capacity shortage and a production cut that has boosted prices, and the latter has yet to reverse a fall in oil production.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Chevron To Buy Anadarko In $33B DealThe Next Geopolitical Flashpoint For OilIs This The End Of The OPEC Deal?

ExxonMobil has raised concerns that part of the crude oil it bought from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) last year contained very high levels of the toxic hydrogen sulfide—the latest company to have complained about tainted crude from the U.S. emergency stockpile, Bloomberg reported on Friday, citing emails it had obtained under the Freedom of Information Act.The U.S. Department of Energy disputes the claims that it has been repeatedly selling crude tainted with dangerous levels of hydrogen sulfide, although it admitted that it had paid some US$1 million to clean up a contaminated cargo for PetroChina, Bloomberg reports. Some of the readings of the companies may have been “spurious” or contamination may have occurred during the shipping of the crude from the SPR to the companies, the Department of Energy told Bloomberg.Exxon is not the first company to have complained of high levels of the toxic hydrogen sulfide in crude bought from the SPR. Last year, Reuters reported that Shell, Macquarie Group, and the U.S. trading arm of PetroChina had raised concerns about the toxic substance in U.S. government crude.



Apart from corroding refinery equipment, high levels of hydrogen sulfide are dangerous to humans, and many effects are seen even at low concentrations, according to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Effects range from mild effects, such as headaches or eye irritation, to very serious consequences, including unconsciousness and death.Related: Chevron To Buy Anadarko In $33B DealChemical engineers told Bloomberg that the possible contamination in the SPR crude could have occurred when high-sulfur crude—put in the stockpile years ago—was blended with oil that has been added more recently, or that bacteria may have grown in the caverns and transformed the sulfur in the sour crude into hydrogen sulfide. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve, set up in the 1970s when the Arab oil embargo created a fuel crisis in the United States, held a total of 649.1 million barrels of crude oil as of April 5, 2019, including 254.6 million barrels of sweet crude and 394.5 million barrels of sour crude oil.



Renewed concerns over the quality of the U.S. strategic oil reserve could undermine the role of the emergency stockpile as a safeguard against shortages of sour crude or affect future sales out of the SPR, according to Bloomberg.  By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Shale Jobs In Jeopardy Despite Oil Price RallyThe Secret Oil Plan That's Critical To Trump’s ReelectionBP Pulls Out Of China’s Shale Patch

Venezuela has sent 1 million barrels of crude to Cuba despite pressure from the United States to suspend these shipments, Reuters reports citing a PDVSA document as well as shipping data.The U.S. has been trying to plug Venezuela’s oil exports through sanctions on PDVSA, which have effectively stopped the flow of Venezuelan oil to U.S. refiners, and through a suspension of diluent exports to Venezuela. The latest was sanctioning 23 vessels and two companies involved in shipments of oil to Cuba.However, as TankerTrackers.com co-founder Samir Madani noted soon after these sanctions were announced, 31 of the 35 sanctioned vessels were not tankers at all but tug boats, as per the official list released by the Department of Treasury.



Reuters noted in its report that the two tankers used to make the latest shipment to Cuba were not on the sanctioned vessels list. One carried 400,000 barrels of crude and the other 600,000 barrels.And that’s not all. Besides the two tankers en route to Cuba with crude oil, there are three more waiting to load refined products, also bound for the Caribbean island.Despite dropping oil production, Venezuela’s still-standing government is adamant about honoring its barter deal with Cuba, which opposition leader Juan Guaido slammed as stealing and called for a suspension of shipments as the oil was more needed at home amid a string of devastating blackouts.



PDVSA, however, is under the control of military officials still loyal to the Maduro government, hence the continued shipments to Cuba, whose leader, Raul Castro has been equally adamant that the island will continue supporting its ideological ally.Venezuela’s oil production fell sharply last month, by 289,000 bpd to below 1 million bpd—to 732,000 bpd in March, according to OPEC’s secondary sources cited in the latest edition of its closely watched Monthly Oil Market Report.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Chevron To Buy Anadarko In $33B DealThe Secret Oil Plan That's Critical To Trump’s ReelectionBP Pulls Out Of China’s Shale Patch

North Korea is making its move into the renewable and other alternative energy business, according to a CNBC report.North Korea, which has suffered under the weight of sanctions that have targeted the country’s need for energy, is now looking to solar, wind, tidal power, and even coal gasification—to generate power as coal, oil, fuel, and diesel imports to the blacklisted country are few and far in between.



Numerous reports have shown that North Korea has received oil shipments during the sanctions period, including ship to ship transfers, but the squeeze is on, and few countries are willing to export to North Korea in defiance of those sanctions.In a rare move, North Korea has sent its engineers to both China and Russia to learn what they can about alternative energy, CNBC reports, in order to keep the lights on—and the military running—at home.



Talks between North Korea and the United States thus far have proved rather unfruitful, and North Korea continues to ratchet up the ways in which it can get its hands on energy as it becomes increasingly desperate to find a work around to the sanctions. Innovative methods to skirting the UN sanctions include physically disguising tankers, identity fraud, night transfers, and manipulation of vessel AIS transmission systems.Finding a domestic, secured, and lasting energy source may seem like a longshot, but if successful, could mean to end to further negotiations.  North Korea has an abundance of coal to make gasification happen, if not the knowhow, but even if successful, it may not be sufficient—even when combined with tidal-generated energy which it also has the resources to do, to completely make up for what it loses in the sanctions.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Is This The End Of The OPEC Deal?Big Oil Scrambles To Cut Tesla’s LifelineThe Next Geopolitical Flashpoint For Oil

The future of Algeria’s oil industry was called into question earlier this week as its political crisis took hold, and now its future is even more suspect, as its state-run oil company, Sonatrach, will once again find itself under the microscope as old corruption investigations are reopened and as the date is set for presidential elections after President Bouteflika stepped down earlier this month.State-run Sonatrach—inextricably linked with Bouteflika’s regime, is finding itself in good company, after the country’s unrest gave pause to foreign oil players such as Exxon who were quick to disentangle themselves from the chaos. While some foreign energy companies were thought to be taking a wait-and-see approach before proceeding further, it is less likely now that companies will move forward until after the new election—now set for July 4, 2019, according to sources.



But the finalized date for the new elections is not expected to bring calm to the country that has a sordid history of violence when it comes to power changes—the most notable during the struggle between the government and Islamic rebels after it looked like the Islamic rebels were set to be victorious in the 1992 elections and elections were therefore canceled.For Sonatrach, which is looked upon almost as unfavorably as Bouteflika himself, it has already had its share of scandals, and the new investigation announced today may derail the country’s oil industry even further. Sonatrach was at the heart of a money laundering and corruption case that resulted in numerous jail sentences for its leaders just a few short years ago.

Tesla and Panasonic have suspended plans to expand the battery capacity production of Gigafactory 1 in Nevada amid concerns that demand for Tesla’s electric vehicles may be weakening, business news outlet Nikkei Asian Review reported on Thursday, without specifying its sources.According to Nikkei, Tesla and Panasonic—which is producing the battery cells at Gigafactory 1 that Tesla later uses in the battery packs for its vehicles—had plans to increase the battery capacity by 50 percent by 2020.  According to Tesla, in the middle of 2018, battery production at Gigafactory 1 reached an annualized rate of around 20 GWh, making it the highest-volume battery plant in the world.“Tesla currently produces more batteries in terms of kWh than all other carmakers combined,” the EV maker says.



However, Tesla and Panasonic have now decided to freeze major investments in expanding the Gigafactory 1 capacity because EV sales have been below expectations, Nikkei reports.  So far, Tesla and Panasonic have invested US$4.5 billion in Gigafactory 1.  According to Nikkei, Panasonic will also freeze investment in Tesla’s battery and EV plant in Shanghai, providing technical support and a small number of batteries instead.   “We will of course continue to make new investments in Gigafactory 1, as needed,” Tesla said in a statement to CNBC, commenting on the report.



“However, we think there is far more output to be gained from improving existing production equipment than was previously estimated,” Tesla added.The report about moderated expansion plans for Gigafactory 1 comes a week after Tesla reported lackluster vehicle deliveries numbers for the first quarter of 2019.While Tesla was working hard to ramp up production of Model 3, the EV maker faced challenges in deliveries and its total vehicle deliveries in the first quarter slumped by 31 percent from the previous quarter and were well below analyst estimates.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:BP Pulls Out Of China’s Shale PatchExtreme Weather Shows Weak Spots Of Wind, Solar EnergyRun On Aramco Bonds Could Sideline IPO

The number of active oil and gas producing companies in Western Canada declined by nearly 17.5 percent between December 2014, when oil prices were already crashing, and December 2018, a new report from XI Technologies, a Calgary-based research company for the Western Canadian energy industry, showed.According to XI Technologies, the number of active oil and gas companies with reported production in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin (WCSB) dropped from 1,616 in December 2014 to 1,334 as at the end of December 2018—a drop of 282 companies. Most of the decline could be attributed to industry consolidation, which is typical of any downturn in an industry, the research company said.



“Industry consolidation is a natural occurrence in any downturn, and this is certainly not the first time Canada’s oil and gas sector has experienced it. Some weaker players fail and disappear,” XI Technologies said.“Juniors and mids merge to combine their strengths, solidify balance sheets, and grow. Majors acquire companies of all sizes in an effort to grow their asset base, gain economies of scale, and enhance their cashflow and market position in preparation for the inevitable market rebound,” the company noted.



The companies that ceased activity between 2014 and 2018 are likely small oil and gas firms who lacked funding to produce oil and gas from expensive unconventional oil and gas wells, Tom Pavic, senior vice-president with Calgary-based Sayer Energy Advisors, told The Canadian Press.Earlier this week, a report by PetroLMI—the labor market information service for Canada’s oil and gas industry, a division of Energy Safety Canada—found that Canada’s oil and gas industry could shed another 12,500 and more jobs this year, which would bring the total job losses over the past five years to 23 percent of the 2014 total, which stood at 226,500. The reasons PetroLMI lists for the job losses expected for this year contain few surprises, and include “low commodity prices, a decline in capital spending and uncertainty over market access.”   By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:BP Pulls Out Of China’s Shale PatchIEA: Saudi Oil Production Falls To Two-Year LowGoldman: Oil Prices Won’t Reach $80

Shell has sold its 22.45-percent interest in the Anadarko-operated Caesar-Tonga field in the U.S. section of the Gulf of Mexico to Israeli Delek Group for US$965 million.Besides the field operator, Delek Group will join Chevron and Equinor as shareholder in the field. Its share in the field’s remaining reserves, according to the Israeli state company, amounts to 78 million barrels of oil equivalent over the 30 years that remain of the field’s productive life.As part of the deal, the Israeli company will also buy oil produced art the field over a period of 30 years.



The divestment report comes on the heels of Shell’s entry into China’s shale gas industry via a joint exploration project with the country’s largest refiner and main shale gas player, Sinopec. The exploration will take place in the eastern Chinese province of Shandong where Sinopec’s shale operations are.Shell has been actively selling non-essential business operations after its acquisition of BG Group that made it the largest natural gas player in the world but also saddled it with a considerable debt load.Now that prices are improving and so is the company’s performance, Shell has doubled down on its divestment strategy aimed at slimming down the debt load.Related: BP Pulls Out Of China’s Shale Patch



At the same time, the Anglo-Dutch supermajor has been diversifying away from fossil fuels and into EV charging networks and renewables – a strategy reflecting a wide-scale shift in the energy industry towards new, more sustainable revenue streams.Yet Shell has set its sights mainly on electricity. The company last month said it had plans to become the world’s largest power utility by the 2030s. However, it doesn’t just want to produce the most power but the most renewable power, which means Shell will have to generate 214 TWh of renewable power annually in the period to 2035 to accomplish its stated goal.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:IEA: Saudi Oil Production Falls To Two-Year LowGoldman: Oil Prices Won’t Reach $80Extreme Weather Shows Weak Spots Of Wind, Solar Energy

Crude oil demand could begin declining steadily from 2025 onwards if governments and industries get serious about tackling climate change and reducing emissions, asset manager Legal and General Investment Management has warned.Reuters quoted the company as saying if everyone who signed the Paris Agreement on Climate Change decides to really fulfill their commitments by implementing new policies and shrinking the use of fossil fuels, oil demand could shed as much as 40 percent by the early 2040s from today’s levels. This means it would stand at around 60 million barrels daily.



If, however, there is no change in policies concerning climate change, crude oil demand would likely peak at some 110 million bpd around 2030, the asset manager said in a study of the issue. The study aimed at identifying companies that would both benefit from stricter environmental policies and not suffer any negative consequences if no such policies are enforced.Both of these scenarios are less realistic than a middle one, in which governments continue to enforce new policies aimed at arresting the rise in average global temperatures but not at the optimal pace and with the optimal scope.



“It’s hard to argue that if oil demand starts to go into free fall, which is what we see as plausible, that ... the oil and gas industry as a whole remains as intrinsically as profitable as it does today,” the head of commodity research at Legal and General Investment Management, Nick Stansbury, told Reuters.Stansbury added oil companies even stand to benefit from pro-environment policies if they re-orient themselves ahead of the changes such policies bring about.

US natural gas-fired combined-cycle capacity overtook coal-fired capacity in 2018, the US Energy Information Administration reported on Wednesday.In the United States, natural gas-fired combined-cycle (NGCC) capacity has increased for years, finally overtaking coal-fired capacity, which has seen a steady decline over the last decade.To compare, as of January 2019, NGCC capacity in the US reached 264 gigawatts (GW), while coal plant capacity fell to 243 GW.Overall natural gas-fired capacity overtook coal-fired capacity long ago.  NGCC power plants, which are less efficient than other forms of natural gas-fired capacity, accounted for about half of all natural gas-fired capacity in the United States as of the end of 2018.



While natural gas has been gaining traction, coal capacity is steadily declining, shedding about 40 GW of capacity in the last 4 years. Over that same time, about 30 GW of NGCC has been added into the mix.New NGCC capacity additions include Duke Energy’s $1.5 billion, 1640MW Citrus Combined Cycle Station in Florida, which is marketed as a means of offering cleaner fuel to millions of homes,  and Dominion Energy’s $1.3 billion, 1,588MW Greensville station in Virginia.Future plants include Virginia’s 1,650MW Chickahominy Power Station, which garnered few objections during its permitting comment period.Still, new utility-scale capacity will be led by wind, not gas, power. Wind is expected to account for 46% of future additions, while natural gas will account for 34%. Solar will account for just 18%.



According to the EIA, new natural gas capacity for 2019 should add 6.1 GW of electric capacity with most of the capacity additions going to Pennsylvania, Florida, and Louisiana.Fifty-three percent of all planned electric plant retirements this year will come from coal, at 4.5 GW.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Why Amazon Is Suddenly Courting Big OilHas Brazil's Oil Boom Been Overstated?Nigeria Boasts Oil Production Cost of $23 Per Barrel

After seeing significant interest with an unprecedented $100 billion in orders on Tuesday, Aramco’s bond saw but mild upward moves on Wednesday, its first day out of the gate.The lackluster response suggests, according to Reuters sources, that the initial demand was inflated.Despite the $100 billion in orders, only $12 billion of debt was issued—this huge disparity in the two led many to believe that first-day activity would have been stronger than it was. The reason for this, according to a trader who spoke to Reuters, is that many had already anticipated that the demand would be significant and orders would go unfilled, so traders placed additional orders in hopes of elbowing their way past other traders who were also scrambling for a piece of the Aramco pie.



Still an overall success, if not somewhat disappointing, the bond sale has dispelled any notion that traders are overly concerned with getting into bed with Saudi Aramco, which for all intents and purposes is the same thing as The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.Some see yesterday’s bond issuance success as a measure of the interest that Aramco’s massive IPO would generate, should the oil company ever overcome the host of challenges that come with such an undertaking. Others think it’s possible that the IPO will not take place at all now that Aramco has pulled off the bond in what not only could be construed as a face-saving move, but as taking the place of the IPO’s cash generating purpose. The hope? That the IPO would generate a hard-fought $100 billion—harder than issuing bonds, anyway.The official word on Aramco’s IPO is that it is still on track, but quite a ways out, in 2021.



The newly issued bonds slipped early on Wednesday, but still was one of the most heavily traded bonds, according to the Financial Times.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Why Amazon Is Suddenly Courting Big OilTrump’s Executive Order Is A Gamechanger For Oil ShippingOil Rallies Despite Large Crude Build

OPEC and its allies in the production cut deal are committed to rebalancing the market and will not repeat last year’s preemptive production increase to offset expectations of oil supply losses, Suhail Al Mazrouei, the energy minister of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), said on Wednesday.“I think we have learned the lesson. We will do what is required to balance the market. We are not going to jump the gun, pre-produce the volumes that are not required yet,” the UAE’s The National quoted Al Mazrouei as saying at the Bloomberg Invest Abu Dhabi conference today.Al Mazrouei was obviously hinting at the decision by OPEC and Russia to reverse the production cuts in the summer of 2018, in order to ensure a well-supplied market amid expectations that the U.S. would drive Iranian oil exports to zero.



For months, the United States had said that it was aiming to cut off Iran’s oil exports, and the oil market started to fear in the summer of 2018 that a steep decline in Iranian oil barrels would tighten the global market too much. OPEC and Russia moved in to compensate for what was expected to be a significant loss of Iranian oil supply.Related: Smart Money Is Piling Into OilBut then the U.S. granted waivers to Iran’s biggest oil customers, including China and India, and OPEC and its Russia-led allies forged in December a new production cut deal aimed at reversing the new glut that had started to build in Q4 2018 after OPEC anticipated incorrectly.“I think we got a bit carried away with the fact that we took it for granted that those volumes were required by November,” Al Mazrouei said, suggesting that this time around, the OPEC-Russia alliance won’t be fooled into pre-producing more oil when it’s not immediately required by the market.



Last month, the OPEC+ allies canceled a scheduled extraordinary meeting in mid-April, leaving the decision for the cuts extension for a meeting at the end of June instead. Earlier this year, OPEC officials started to signal that mid-April would have been too early to assess the actual impact of the sanctions on Venezuela and the U.S. policy on the waivers for Iranian oil customers, after the current waivers expire in early May.At the June meeting, OPEC and partners will have a clearer picture of where supply might be going, because the U.S. will have already decided whether to extend and to whom to extend waivers for Iranian oil purchases.

The U.S. Department of Energy (DoE) believes that more natural gas-powered capacity will be in the best interest of recovering Puerto Rico’s power grid, Bruce Walker, Assistant Secretary at the Office of Electricity at DoE, said in written testimony before the Committee on Natural Resources at the U.S. House of Representatives.Puerto Rico’s power system remains vulnerable because of underinvestment, poor maintenance, and damage from Hurricane Maria, Walker said, noting that a DoE analysis of the ways to successful recovery found that increasing natural gas generation capacity would benefit the island.“The principal finding of DOE’s analysis is the cost and reliability benefits of increasing natural gas generation capacity in the San Juan metropolitan area, to include the current Palo Seco generating site. DOE’s analysis found 1,200 to 1,600 megawatts (MW) of capacity would greatly enhance the reliability and disaster resilience of Puerto Rico’s power system, while lowering power commodity costs island-wide,” Walker said.



The DoE’s analysis and proposal for more fossil fuel-generation capacity comes weeks after the Puerto Rico legislature passed the Puerto Rico Energy Public Policy Act on March 25, setting a renewable energy target for the island to go 100 percent green by 2050, up from the 2-percent renewable capacity installed today. The act—which is pending the signing of the Puerto Rico Governor—also includes provisions supporting distributed generation, the privatization process, and grid resilience.DoE’s Walker admitted in his testimony that the proposal for more natural gas-powered capacity could be at odds with the island’s push for renewables.“DOE believes increasing natural gas generating capacity in the San Juan area would be one of the single most valuable investment for PREPA’s long-term recovery. However, pursuing this investment may be at odds with the island’s energy policy should the Governor choose to sign the Puerto Rico Energy Public Policy Act,” Walker said.



Puerto Rico’s Governor Ricardo Rossello said on the day on which the territory passed the renewable target act “Before Hurricanes Irma and María destroyed our island in 2017, close to 50% of the island’s power generation came from oil-burning plants, and 17% came from coal.”“As set forth in our #PledgeForPuertoRico, we have ambitious plans to transform Puerto Rico’s hurricane-battered electric grid to 100% renewable energy by 2050,” Governor Rossello tweeted.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Oil Rallies Despite Large Crude BuildSmart Money Is Piling Into OilBig Oil Faces Multibillion Dollar Fallout From Algeria Crisis

Norway’s Equinor is pushing back the start-up of a major heavy oil field offshore the UK to the second half of this year in order to check all electrical couplings on the platform, according to the head of major projects at the Norwegian oil and gas giant.  The start-up of the Mariner oil field—one of the largest developments on the UK Continental Shelf (UKCS) in recent years which costs US$5.9 billion (4.5 billion British pounds)—has been already delayed several times.  The development of the Mariner field will contribute more than 300 million barrels of oil with average plateau production of some 55,000 barrels per day, according to the field operator Equinor, which expects Mariner to provide a long-term cash-flow over 30 years. Equinor’s website says that production is expected to start in the first half of 2019.



However, Equinor’s vice president for major projects Morten Ruth told Reuters on Wednesday that the first-half 2019 target would not be met because Equinor had decided to inspect all 40,000 electrical couplings on the platform, after early tests showed a “too high” failure rate at the couplings. Equinor had 56 percent of the work on the Mariner platform completed as of this week.According to Ruth, the electrical couplings can lead to an explosion if gas gets to the platform.“We see the startup getting closer. We see that we will be able to complete all preparations before July, but there are uncertainties,” Ruth told Reuters.



The manager expects Mariner’s start-up between July and early September.This is not the first delay of start-up at Mariner. In October last year, Equinor said that “challenging weather conditions” would prevent it from starting up the field in the fourth quarter of 2018 and pushed the start-up date into 2019.Equinor is the operator of the Mariner field with a 65.11-percent stake, with co-venturers JX Nippon with 20 percent, Siccar Point with an 8.89-percent interest, and Dyas with a 6-percent stake. By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Oil & Gas Discoveries On The Rise As Oil Majors Dive InSmart Money Is Piling Into OilBig Oil Faces Multibillion Dollar Fallout From Algeria Crisis

The National Assembly of Venezuela—dominated by the opposition—has authorized the parallel opposition-elected board of state oil firm PDVSA to negotiate the company’s foreign debts, including whether to make later this month an interest payment on a bond backed by a 49-percent interest in PDVSA’s most precious foreign asset, U.S. refiner Citgo.Venezuela’s National Assembly approved on Tuesday a proposal to increase the number of members of the ad hoc board at PDVSA to nine from five, and appointed Luis Pacheco, a former PDVSA executive, to lead the board, Elias Matta, an opposition lawmaker and chairman of the Assembly’s energy committee, said.“Today, Citgo is in the hands of Venezuelans and is being managed by the ad hoc board of directors approved by this Assembly,” Matta added.In February, Venezuela’s opposition led by U.S.-backed leader Juan Guaido appointed new directors at PDVSA and at Citgo in a challenge to Maduro and in an effort to take control over Venezuela’s oil assets—pretty much the only assets that generate hard currency for the struggling Latin American country sitting on top of the world’s largest crude oil reserves.



The National Assembly authorizing the opposition-backed board to hold debt negotiations for PDVSA’s foreign debt means that this ad hoc parallel board could decide the fate of U.S. Citgo Petroleum—the crown jewel which Nicolas Maduro was also very careful not to let slip out of PDVSA’s hands by making every bond payment backed by Citgo shares.However, another payment is due in just over two weeks: an interest payment of US$71 million on PDVSA’s 2020 bond is due on April 27. Failure to pay the interest could trigger a bondholders’ rush to seize Citgo, because the 2020 PDVSA bond is backed by a stake in the U.S. refiner.Related: European Markets Defy The Biggest Oil Rally In A Decade“They will evaluate if they are going to pay the bonds. That is now their decision,” Matta told Reuters in a phone interview, referring to the ad hoc board at PDVSA.  “We will do everything we have to do to protect the republic’s assets,” Matta told Reuters, noting that the board needs to inform the National Assembly if it decides to make the payment. 



As early as at the end of February, Guaido’s newly appointed U.S.-based Attorney General, Jose Ignacio Hernandez, told Bloomberg, referring to PDVSA’s bond payments:“All obligations will be honored since they’re key to the protection of state assets.”  By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Oil Rallies Despite Large Crude BuildSmart Money Is Piling Into OilBig Oil Faces Multibillion Dollar Fallout From Algeria Crisis

""Today, a very large meeting of terrorist groups and armed groups took place in Sirte, we know who they belong to. They have a plan proposed at the meeting to attack the Oil Crescent"", a spokesman for the Libyan National Army has told local media as cited by Russia’s Sputnik as fighting between the LNA and rival groups intensify, sending oil prices higher.The LNA is affiliated with the eastern Libyan government that has not been recognized by the UN. The group wrested control over the Oil Crescent from the Petroleum Facilities Guard two years ago and passed it onto the National Oil Corporation that is also recognized by the UN. Now, however, General Khalifa Haftar’s army wants more than control of the Oil Crescent, and the fighting has moved to Tripoli.



NOC’s chairman, Mustafa Sanalla, has vowed to make sure production continues uninterrupted whatever happens in the Oil Crescent, but as previous events have shown, when a group is determined enough to cause a production outage at an oil field, they have the means to do it, whether by blocking a pipeline or any facility at the field.""Continued production is vital to our economic and shared future. However, we will spare no effort to ensure all sector employees are protected and kept out of harm's way. Conflict only serves to deepen division in our country and jeopardize our national recovery"", Sanalla said earlier this week. True though this may be, there are too many rival groups vying for control of the country’s oil wealth to leave the industry out of politics as Sanalla suggested.



Libya produced a little over 900,000 bpd of crude in February, the latest month for which OPEC has production data. This was slightly up from January but down from the over 1 million bpd in production on average for the last quarter of 2018 before a massive outage at the country’s largest field, Sharara, occurred, suspending production for weeks. Again, the reason for the outage was clashes between armed groups.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Smart Money Is Piling Into OilEuropean Markets Defy The Biggest Oil Rally In A DecadeGermany’s “Circle Of Five” Roiled In New Scandal

The American Petroleum Institute (API) reported a build in crude oil inventory of 4.1 million barrels for the week ending April 5, coming in over analyst expectations of a ­2.294-million-barrel build.Last week, the API reported a surprise build in crude oil of 3.0 million barrels. A day later, the EIA confirmed the build, but a much more significant, shocking markets with a report of a 7.2 million buildup in inventory. Including this week’s data, the net build is now 7.53 million barrels for the 13-week reporting period so far this year, using API data.


WTI was trading down on Tuesday before the data release at $64.02, down $0.38 (-0.59%) on the day at 12:29pm, although up week on week. The Brent benchmark was also trading down on the day at $70.77, down $0.33 (-.46%) at that time. The Brent benchmark was also up week on week.The recent string of price hikes has catapulted oil to near 5-month highs as US sanctions on Iran and Venezuela, unrest in Libya, and continued OPEC production cuts all factor into the mix. So much so, in fact, that high US production, as well US inventories—the market’s most transparent metric for oil inventories—have taken somewhat of a backseat.The API this week reported a draw in gasoline inventories for week ending April 5 in the amount of 7.1 million barrels. Analysts estimated a much smaller draw in gasoline inventories of 2.009 million barrels for the week.US crude oil production as estimated by the Energy Information Administration showed that production for the week ending March 29—the latest information available—rose to an average of 12.2 million bpd—another new all-time high for the United States.



Distillate inventories decreased by 2.4 million barrels, compared to an expected a draw of 1.3 million barrels for the week.Crude oil inventories at the Cushing, Oklahoma facility fell by 1.3 million barrels for the week.The U.S. Energy Information Administration report on crude oil inventories is due to be released on Wednesday at 10:30a.m. EST.By 4:40pm EST, WTI was trading down at $64.10 and Brent was trading down at $70.66.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads from Oilprice.com:The ‘Marginal’ Producer Driving The Oil Price RallyOil & Gas Discoveries On The Rise As Oil Majors Dive InShell Ventures Into China’s Shale Oil

ExxonMobil, France’s Total, and Australia’s Oil Search have signed a gas agreement with Papua New Guinea, outlining the fiscal terms for a new liquefied natural gas (LNG) project in the Pacific island, estimated to cost US$13 billion and thought to double Papua New Guinea’s LNG exports from the Exxon-operated PNG LNG plant.The gas agreement for Papua LNG allows the three partners to begin the Front-End Engineering Design (FEED) phase of study that will lead to the final investment decision (FID) on the project in 2020, Total said in a statement on Tuesday.The project of 5.4 million tons per annum (Mtpa) capacity will consist of two LNG trains of 2.7 Mtpa capacity each. Total will operate the gas production, while the LNG plant will be developed in synergy with Exxon-operated PNG LNG project through an expansion of the existing plant in Caution Bay, the French company said.“We are very pleased with the progress of this competitive LNG project that benefits from the brownfield synergies with existing liquefaction facilities and the proximity to Asian markets,” Total’s chairman and CEO Patrick Pouyanné said.



“It will further strengthen our position in the Pacific basin and ensure our future LNG portfolio growth,” he noted.According to Peter Botten, Oil Search’s Managing Director:“FEED is expected to result in a Final Investment Decision in 2020, which will ensure that first production from our new, globally competitive, LNG trains is available in 2024.”If Papua LNG makes it through the final investment decision next year, it will add to supply of the super-chilled fuel in the middle of next decade, when LNG demand is expected to have continued to rise.



In 2019, at a time in which LNG spot prices in Asia are down compared to the previous two years, the global LNG market could be set for a record year of project sanctions, according to Wood Mackenzie’s estimates from January this year.“Frontrunners in the race to hit FID include the US$27 billion Arctic LNG-2 in Russia, at least one project in Mozambique and three in the US,” WoodMac says.  By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Germany’s “Circle Of Five” Roiled In New ScandalOil Markets Set For Further ‘’Disruption’’The ‘Marginal’ Producer Driving The Oil Price Rally

The Mexican government may consider creating a small network of gas stations that would sell gasoline at lower, “fair prices”, if gas station operators in the country don’t keep gas prices in check, Mexico’s leftist President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said on Tuesday.López Obrador—in office since December 1, 2018—called on gas station operators in Mexico to sell gas at lower prices by cutting their profit margins, Reuters quoted the Mexican president as saying at a regular news briefing on Tuesday.The government will publicize which gas stations in Mexico sell gasoline at the lowest prices, said López Obrador.“If this doesn’t work... to reach our goal of no price increases, we would consider creating a network of gas stations... enough so that stations sell at fair prices,” Lopez Obrador said at today’s briefing, as carried by Reuters.



At the end of last year, Lopez Obrador ordered the Mexican military to begin a major crackdown on fuel theft across Mexico, which resulted in days of gas shortages in Mexico City and other cities in the country.Leftist López Obrador also wants a greater role for Pemex in reversing the downward trend in Mexican oil production.Pemex’s crude oil production continues to decline—according to Pemex figures, its crude oil production averaged 1.813 million bpd in 2018. To compare, Pemex’s crude oil production averaged 2.429 million bpd in 2014, falling to 1.948 million bpd in 2017.Related: Oil & Gas Discoveries On The Rise As Oil Majors Dive InLópez Obrador and Pemex have grand plans for reversing the decline, with the government coming to the rescue of Pemex, as the oil firm itself said in December. A new strategic plan aims to guarantee “the country’s energy security and sovereignty” and targets to raise crude oil production to 2.48 million bpd by the end of this administration’s term in office—the end of 2024.



One hundred days into office, López Obrador has already cancelled upcoming oil and gas auctions and banned fracking in moves undoing his predecessor’s energy reform that opened Mexico’s oil industry to foreign investment in 2013 for the first time in seven decades.“For all practical purposes, energy reform in Mexico is dead,” Tony Payan, director of the Mexico Center at Rice University’s Baker Institute, told Houston Chronicle’s Sergio Chapa last month.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Oil Hits 5-Month High On Libya TurmoilShell Ventures Into China’s Shale OilOil Markets Set For Further ‘’Disruption’’

India is not booking Iranian crude oil due to load in May, as refiners in one of Iran’s key oil customers are waiting for more clarity from the U.S. on whether India will get its sanctions waiver extended, Reuters reported on Tuesday, citing four sources.  The U.S. waivers for eight key Iranian oil customers, including the biggest buyers China, India, Japan, and South Korea, expire in early May.While the U.S. Administration says that it continues to pursue zero Iranian oil exports, analysts expect Washington to extend waivers to at least a few of the currently exempted buyers, with reduced volumes allowed under the new waivers, as the Administration wouldn’t want to push oil prices too high.



According to Reuters’ sources today, India hopes to have more clarity within ten days on whether the U.S. will extend the sanctions waiver and on the volumes of oil that India would be allowed to purchase in case its waiver is extended. Under its current exemption from the U.S. sanctions on Iran, India is allowed to buy some 300,000 bpd of Iranian oil.As the ‘waivers window’ is shrinking as we approach early May, buyers may be rushing to buy what they can before April to squeeze in under the current waiver in case waivers are not extended, according to analysts.



Japanese refiners, for example, are unlikely to continue buying Iranian crude from April onwards, the president of the Petroleum Association of Japan, Takashi Tsukuoka, said last month, as quoted by Reuters.Two South Korean refiners have bought an unspecified amount of U.S. superlight oil to test it as a potential replacement for Iranian condensate, Reuters reported last week, citing sources.  South Korea, meanwhile, is discussing a waivers extension with U.S. officials and is calling on the Trump Administration to show “utmost flexibility” in allowing Seoul to continue importing Iranian oil, Korean outlet KBS WORLD reported on Tuesday, quoting a South Korean official.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Oil Hits $70 On Libya Unrest, Crisis In VenezuelaNigeria Boasts Oil Production Cost of $23 Per BarrelPlatts Survey: OPEC Oil Production Down To More Than 4-Year Low

Canada’s oil and gas industry could shed another 12,500 and more jobs this year, which would bring the total job losses over the past five years to 23 percent of the 2014 total, which stood at 226,500. These are among the findings of a report by PetroLMI, the labor market information service for Canada’s oil and gas industry, a division of Energy Safety Canada.The reasons PetroLMI lists for the job losses expected for this year contain few surprises, and include “low commodity prices, a decline in capital spending and uncertainty over market access.”



“Many exploration and production and oil sands companies reported only limited capital and production guidance for 2019 because of the uncertain market conditions,” said PetroLMI’s vice president, Carol Howes, in a comment on the report’s findings.This is the latest sign that Canada’s oil and gas industry has a long way to go before it recovers despite the efforts of the Alberta government, which last year imposed obligatory production cuts on oil companies operating in the province to arrest the decline in prices.



While the move turned out to be successful, it had a boomerang effect, making Canadian crude less appealing to refiners. Chinese companies, which went on a shopping spree when Western Canadian Select was trading at a US$50 discount to WTI per barrel, completely stopped buying it when prices began to rise. U.S. refiners—the largest market for Canadian heavy crude—also became less willing to pay more for the crude. This led to a buildup in crude oil inventories in February, despite the cuts.The natural gas segment is not faring much better, according to the PetroLMI report. “Stalled progress on the development of new pipeline and liquefied natural gas (LNG) infrastructure projects, heightened uncertainty, however, and lowered investor confidence,” the report’s authors said.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Saudis Threaten ‘Nuclear Option’ To Kill PetrodollarEV Superchargers Are Already Here… But There’s A CatchGoldman: The Renewables Revolution Is Good For Big Oil

Venezuela will not stop shipping crude oil to its political ally Cuba despite U.S. sanctions, the country’s foreign minister said as quoted by Reuters.“When the conventional power of capitalism attacks you, you have to know how to respond through non-conventional means, always respecting international law,” Jorge Arreaza said.The official’s statement follows the imposition of more sanctions by Washington on Caracas. This time the sanctions targeted 34 tankers owned or operated by PDVSA along with another vessel and two companies involved in shipments of Venezuelan oil to Cuba.



Washington is calling the oil deal between Venezuela and Cuba “oil for oppression”.Cuba is heavily reliant on subsidized Venezuelan oil shipments, which is why Washington is apparently trying to hit two birds with one stone by stopping these shipments. The leader of the Venezuelan opposition, Juan Guaido, last month ordered the suspension of these deliveries, but PDVSA’s management is still loyal to the Maduro government, so the order had more of a symbolic significance than anything else.The Venezuelan crisis has already forced Cuba to adjust its energy sources, and the country increased its imports from Russia and also last year signed a contract for more oil product deliveries from Algeria, another long-term partner.



Yet Venezuelan oil and oil products have continued to play an important role in Cuba’s energy supply, not least because it has been, from a certain perspective, free. The two have a barter deal; Cuba sends highly trained doctors and other personnel to Venezuela in exchange for the barrels.According to Reuters shipping data, the latest cargo of Venezuelan oil products to Cuba left the port of Jose last Thursday: liquefied petroleum gas. In the second half of March, Reuters added, four tankers—two loaded with crude and two with oil products—left Venezuela for Cuba.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Oil Hits $70 On Libya Unrest, Crisis In VenezuelaNigeria Boasts Oil Production Cost of $23 Per BarrelPlatts Survey: OPEC Oil Production Down To More Than 4-Year Low

Despite concern from some investors that Saudi Aramco is basically the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the oil giant’s debut U.S.-dollar bond has attracted orders for more than US$100 billion—the highest demand for an emerging market bond ever, Reuters reported on Tuesday, hours before Aramco was set to price the bond.Saudi Aramco was expected to raise US$10 billion with its first-ever international bond, and is expected to price the six-part bond issue later on Tuesday. Aramco’s bond issue is divided into six tranches—of 3, 5, 10, 20, and 30 years, and a three-year floating rate bond.  The high demand for the oil company’s bond shows strong investor appetite, despite warnings from analysts and concerns of some investors that Saudi Arabia’s government will continue to exert influence on Aramco’s operations, production, tax rates, and dividends.



The record-breaking demand for the bond could be seen as a measure of interest in Aramco’s initial public offering (IPO), which has been postponed numerous times, but which Saudi Arabia currently claims is on track to take place some time in 2021.However, analysts see potential equity investors—if an IPO indeed takes place in the coming years—more concerned about the strong linkage between the Saudi government and Saudi Aramco than bond investors in the current bond issue. Potential shareholders in Aramco could be anxious that the Saudis would favor returns to the government from the company’s operations rather than thinking of returns to equity investors.Early last week, Aramco received high first-time credit ratings from Fitch Ratings and Moody’s before the launch of the international bond.



But both Fitch and Moody’s—while praising the oil giant’s strong balance sheet, a very conservative financial profile with low debt, low costs of production, and strong profitability—noted that their respective ratings are capped by the very close linkage between Aramco and the government of Saudi Arabia. Aramco’s rating would have been higher were it not for the close link between the company and the government, the rating agencies said.

Drivers in the United States are paying more at the pump over the last eight weeks, as retail gasoline prices now averages $2.75 per gallon in the US, according to GasBuddy, who compiles millions of data points from 135,000 gas stations across the US.Gas prices have ticked upward $0.50 per gallon over the last 90 days. Crude oil prices, a component of gasoline prices, have also risen over the last three months, with WTI climbing from $48.52 per barrel on January 7 to $64.34 per barrel today.While the nationwide average gas price rises, West Coast gasoline prices—specifically California—have risen even higher, and the Golden State will soon see prices exceed $4 per gallon on average, the liks of which hasn’t been seen for over five years.



Further complicating matters, California has seen some refinery outages including Valero’s refinery in the Bay Area which was shut down after air quality concerns. Phillips 66 refinery in LA was also shut down after a refinery fire, and Chevron’s El Segundo refinery—the largest in the sate—has been down for more than a week.“It really is going to be ugly this week in the West Coast, and any further issues could lead to more spikes, but for the rest of the country expect the rise to continue for a ninth straight week with little good news on the horizon,” Patrick DeHaan, head of petroleum analysis for GasBuddy said.The average cost of a gallon of gasoline was $3.884 in Los Angeles on Monday, surpassing the price at the pump in even Hawaii.

China is set to import massive amounts of LNG in 2019 as part of its determined push to switch away from coal and toward the lower emissions natural gas, but this robust demand is unlikely to curb the current inventory glut in Asia, according to Reuters, citing Fereidun Fesharaki, chairman of energy consultancy FGE.While China’s LNG demand growth is set to increase by 14 percent in 2019 over 2018 levels—between 30 billion and 40 billion cubic meters—it’s lower than the 2018 demand growth of 18 percent, according to data from the National Development Reform Commission. This demand growth is also likely to be lower than supply, which has increased dramatically over the last year as Australia, United States, and Russia increase production.



New production for LNG this year is expected to surpass LNG demand by 2 percent, according to Reuters calculations. This lopsided equation is unlikely to improve LNG prices which have plummeted about 60 percent in the last six months alone.On the demand side of the equation, these low LNG prices are still above pipeline gas prices, and as the new Russia pipeline comes onstream to carry gas to China, demand for LNG may falter, CNPC’s Ling told Reuters last week, although this is still many months away from completion.



The Russia to China pipeline, dubbed the Power of Siberia, is expected to come online in December 2019.China continues its effort to switch away from coal, with an eye on lowering coal’s percentage of its energy mix to 35 percent in 2040 to 60 percent in 2017, according to BP estimates as published in the BP Energy Outlook 2019. China’s domestic natural gas production has so far been unable to ramp up as quickly as they would like, leaving imports to fill the gaps on the road to reduced coal consumption.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:China-South Sudan Oil Deal Raises Red FlagsAramco’s Mega Debt Deal Is A Raging SuccessOil & Gas Discoveries On The Rise As Oil Majors Dive In

The United States is looking to create a strategy for developing critical minerals such as lithium in a bid to bolster domestic supply for electric vehicles (EVs) and lessen dependence on lithium imports, especially from China.Early next month, U.S. government officials are expected to meet with senior managers from carmakers and lithium mining companies to possibly launch a U.S. national strategy for boosting American processing facilities of lithium, Reuters reports, citing sources familiar with the plans. According to two of the sources, U.S. Senators, as well as officials from the Department of State, Department of the Interior, Department of Energy, and the U.S. Geological Survey plan to attend the meeting scheduled to take place in early May.



Lithium is the key mineral for the EV makers from Tesla to all the legacy automakers who are venturing en masse into the EV market.The U.S. holds around 5 percent of the global market of lithium-ion battery production, which is dominated by China with a share of almost two-thirds. China is also home to most of the lithium processing factories in the world, according to data from Benchmark Minerals Intelligence, cited by Reuters.In January 2019, there were nearly 5 million passenger EVs on the road globally, Angus McCrone, Chief Editor at BloombergNEF (BNEF), wrote in an article earlier this year. China will continue to be the leader in terms of volumes sold this year, with some 1.5 million of EV sales, accounting for around 57 percent of the global market, McCrone said.



Even the steep cuts in Chinese EV subsidies announced at the end of March are unlikely to deter China’s fast volume growth, Fitch Ratings said in a note on Monday.“We expect demand in the world’s largest EV market to be supported by increasingly attractive product offerings, as well as wider commercial use of passenger EVs, in addition to a potential ""pull-forward"" effect in 2Q19,” Fitch Ratings said.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Aramco’s Mega Debt Deal Is A Raging SuccessEV Superchargers Are Already Here… But There’s A CatchSaudis Threaten ‘Nuclear Option’ To Kill Petrodollar

Aramco is planning to spend some US$16 billion on contracts with small and medium-sized enterprises in a bid to expand cooperation with this segment of the economy, Reuters reports, citing Saudi media.Every year, the Saudi oil giant spends some US$45.33 billion (170 billion riyal) on various services, Al Arabiya quoted the company’s deputy director of procurement and supply, Mohammed bin Ayed al-Shamri as saying. At least part of this money could be used to stimulate the growth of small and medium enterprises in an economy trying to wean itself off the oil that has been feeding it for decades.The sum pales in comparison with Aramco’s growth strategy for the future. In addition to several refinery projects in Asia, which will cost it a few dozen billion dollars, the oil giant is also expanding internationally in other ways, eager to diversify away from just crude oil production and exports.



Last November, Aramco’s chief executive Amin Nasser said the company will spend US$500 billion over the next ten years to expand internationally, with a fifth of the total amount earmarked for petrochemical projects and US$160 billion for natural gas projects.Nasser noted that the investment sum was separate from the US$70 billion it is planning to splash on the acquisition of a majority stake in local petrochemical major Sabic, which Aramco recently said it will fund with a combination of its own cash and money raised through an international bond.Related: Goldman: The Renewables Revolution Is Good For Big Oil“We need a major acquisition for us to be in different markets quickly,” Nasser told Bloomberg in November, referring to the Sabic acquisition. Petrochemicals demand is seen by many analysts as the primary crude oil demand driver of the future, so it makes sense that a company the size of Aramco is looking to gain greater exposure to this segment of the industry.



Plans are for Aramco to use almost a third of its daily production rate, or some 3 million bpd of crude oil, to produce chemicals. Also, the company eyes a twofold increase in its refining capacity by 2025. “You can absorb market volatility when you are balanced between upstream and downstream,” the chief executive said. “This is where our strategy is going.”By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:China-South Sudan Oil Deal Raises Red FlagsAramco’s Mega Debt Deal Is A Raging SuccessOil & Gas Discoveries On The Rise As Oil Majors Dive In

A senior Russian official has suggested Russia will press for an end of the OPEC+ production cuts after the end of June when the original agreement expires, Reuters reports.Kiril Dmitriev, head of the country’s direct investment fund, has been a staunch supporter of the OPEC+ cooperation since the beginning, which makes his latest remarks all the more significant.“It is quite possible that given the improving market situation and falling stocks, (OPEC and its allies) could decide in June this year to abandon supply cuts and subsequently increase output,” Reuters quoted Dmitriev as saying.



“This decision will not mean the end of the deal but a confirmation that participants continue their coordinating efforts when it is important not only to cut but to increase output depending on market conditions,” the official added in keeping with his original stance on the partnership between the cartel and Russia.Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia’s Energy Minister also had comments to make about the agreement: Khalid al-Falih told media it was too early to say whether the agreement would be extended beyond the end of June, adding that next month would be crucial for where OPEC+ would go in the second half of the year.“JMMC will be a key decision point because we will certainly by then know where the consensus view is and, more importantly, before we ask for consensus, we will know where the fundamentals are pointing,” he said.Related: Oil Hits $70 On Libya Unrest, Crisis In Venezuela



The joint ministerial monitoring committee of OPEC+ is meeting in May.Russia’s oil companies have been reluctant to take part in the production cuts this time around. In fact, there were reports earlier this year that Rosneft and other state entities were pushing for an end of Russia’s participation in the pact so they could start ramping up production again.Saudi Arabia, on the other hand, is trying to convince the rest of OPEC and its partners to keep pumping at the reduced rate until Brent goes above US$70 a barrel for a more extended period of time than a day.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Platts Survey: OPEC Oil Production Down To More Than 4-Year LowEV Superchargers Are Already Here… But There’s A CatchNigeria Boasts Oil Production Cost of $23 Per Barrel

In a major policy shift during the weekend, Norway’s Labor Party—a long-time ally of the oil industry and the biggest party that is currently in opposition—said it would no longer support opening up the Lofoten archipelago to oil drilling, taking Norway a step closer to a permanent drilling ban in the area.The scenic Lofoten archipelago is currently off limits for oil drilling thanks to years of political compromises. The ruling Conservative Party, as well as Labor until very recently, supported in principle the launch of feasibility studies for potential development, but didn’t have the support from their junior partners when in power.Now with the Labor Party withdrawing its support to potential oil development, the Lofoten area will likely remain off-limits for oil exploration, as the biggest party joins the smaller parties in Norway’s Parliament who don’t want to risk damaging the pristine archipelago either.  



Environmentalists and smaller parties in Norway have been strongly opposed to any meddling with the beauty of the Lofoten, Vesterålen, and Senja islands.“It takes courage and vision to stand up for systemic change. The permanent protection from oil drilling and exploration in Lofoten in Northern Norway should serve as an example for the rest of the world,” environmental protection organization SeaLegacy said, commenting on the Labor Party’s decision.The major shift in position from the biggest party and long-time oil industry supporter, Labor, likely means that the area will never be tapped. 



Estimates have put the potential oil resources underneath the picturesque islands at between 1.3 billion and 3 billion barrels of oil equivalent, estimated to be worth US$60-65 billion.The shift in the Labor Party’s position on Lofoten drilling, however, could make the oil industry nervous that further shifts in political support for oil drilling could come in the future.According to Bloomberg, the oil drilling debate could now move to whether more areas in the Arctic Barents Sea should be open to oil drilling and development.  By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Saudi Arabia Threatens To Drop Dollar For Oil TradesSupermajor Shell Looks To Revitalize The Rust BeltNew Offensive Brings Libya To The Brink Of War

Oil products output at Europe’s largest oil refinery—Shell’s 404,000-bpd Pernis refinery in the Netherlands—will be reduced after workers started a strike on Monday, demanding higher wages.  “There will be impact on production but at this point we can’t say exactly what the exact impact will be because we don’t know yet,” a spokeswoman for Shell told Reuters today, confirming that the industrial action, which local trade unions threatened in March, had begun.In March, Dutch trade union CNV gave Shell seven days to meet their demands before announcing a strike.   At the end of last month, CNV said that workers would reduce production at the Pernis refinery and the Moerdijk chemical plant beginning on April 8 and would keep output at lower levels until workers’ demand are met.



The union had given no indications of the amount of output reduction, but Pernis is the largest oil refinery in Europe, and the point is to reduce output to a level that would force Shell to meet demands for higher wages.Unions want a 5-percent wages increase, while Shell offers a 2-percent raise this year and another 2.5-percent salary increase next year, according to Reuters.“We are taking it day by day, we will have another technical meeting with the unions this afternoon, and we will take it from there,” Shell’s spokeswoman told Reuters today.According to the FNV trade union, production at the Pernis refinery will be gradually cut to 65 percent of the facility’s capacity today, as part of the strike for higher wages.



The reduction will be kept in place until Wednesday night, after which the trade union will discuss where negotiations are going and what to do next, FNV trade union’s spokesman Egbert Schellenberg told Reuters on Monday.Shell has just launched a new unit at Pernis in October last year to enhance performance and reduce environmental impact by enabling the processing of more oil into cleaner transportation fuels.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Saudis Threaten ‘Nuclear Option’ To Kill PetrodollarEV Superchargers Are Already Here… But There’s A CatchGoldman: The Renewables Revolution Is Good For Big Oil

“The Ministry of Energy, Industry and Mineral Resources affirmed today that recently circulated claims that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is threatening to sell its oil in currencies other than the dollar are inaccurate and do not reflect Saudi Arabia’s position on this matter,” a statement from the Saudi Press Agency reads. This is the official state news agency of the Kingdom.The statement follows reports that Riyadh was considering switching from the greenback to other currencies in its oil trade in response to anti-OPEC legislation plans in the U.S. Congress.Reuters reported last week, citing unnamed sources, that the switch from U.S. dollars to other currencies had been discussed in senior Saudi circles and that it had also been shared with U.S. government officials from the energy department.



The reported threat takes OPEC’s—Saudi Arabia’s—offensive against the No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels Act a step further after last month UAE oil minister, Suhail al-Mazrouei, reportedly told lenders at the meeting that if the bill was made into law that made OPEC members liable to U.S. anti-cartel legislation, the group, which is to all intents and purposes indeed a cartel, would break up and every member would boost production to its maximum.According to the SPA statement, however, “The Kingdom has been trading its oil in dollars for decades which has served well the objectives of its financial and monetary policies.”The traditionally close relationship between Washington and Riyadh began to strain in the wake of the 2014 oil price collapse and the straining intensified after the public outcry in the West over the killing of Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi, a vocal critic of Crown Prince Mohammed.



Tension flared higher when a group of U.S. legislators introduced the so-called NOPEC bill seeking to make OPEC members accountable under U.S. cartel legislation. According to the Reuters sources, Riyadh kept dropping the dollar for oil trading up its sleeve as “the nuclear option.”By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Saudis Threaten ‘Nuclear Option’ To Kill PetrodollarGoldman: The Renewables Revolution Is Good For Big OilEV Superchargers Are Already Here… But There’s A Catch

Vice President Mike Pence announced that the United States will add 34 PDVSA owned or operated vessels to the sanctions list on Friday, according to Reuters. The announcement came during the Vice President’s Friday Venezuela-focused speech at Rice University’s Baker Institute of Public Policy in Houston—an invitation-only event.The sanctions not only target the 34 PDVSA vessels but also two firms that transport Venezuela crude oil to neighboring Cuba, Pence said, adding that this may not be the final thing added to the sanctions, as the US mulls even more sanctions, this time targeting the financial sector.The event on Friday at Rice likely met with a captive audience, as Houston is home to a very large Venezuelan population in its Katy suburb dubbed Katyzuela. Naturally, many Venezuelan’s fleeing their homeland had served in its oil business, and Houston had much to offer along that line of the work.



The US originally levied sanctions against Venezuela to get Nicolas Maduro to step down. The United States and many other nations have since recognized Maduro’s opposition, Juan Guaido, as the legitimate president of Venezuela.Related: One Last Warning For The U.S. Shale PatchMaduro has yet to succumb to international pressure even as its financial means come up short. Maduro has responded only by cracking down on his opposition, first by slapping him with a travel ban, second from holding public office, and most recently stripping him of his parliamentary immunity. Guaido and Maduro both remain undeterred by the external pressures placed on them.



Venezuela’s oil industry, on the other hand, has proven less resilient. Venezuela’s crude oil production has taken quite a hit, with March’s production dropping to 740,000 barrels per day—a 16 year low—according to an S&P Platts survey published on Friday.A flurry of blackouts has also wreaked havoc in its oil industry—responsible for 90% of its revenues—and oil exports are expected to fall even further this month.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:U.S. On The Hunt For Iranian “Ghost Tankers”Tesla Lagging Behind Competitors In European EV MarketsWhy No One Is Interested In Building EV Infrastructure

Weeks after Norway’s government proposed that the country’s US$1-trillion fund divest from pure exploration and production oil companies, the cabinet said on Friday that it will allow the world’s biggest sovereign wealth fund to invest in unlisted renewable energy infrastructure.“The Government is now allowing for the Government Pension Fund Global to be invested in unlisted renewable energy infrastructure. The investments shall be made within the scope of the special environment-related mandates only,” the Norwegian government said in a statement.Norway is also doubling the upper limit on unlisted green energy investments from US$7 billion (60 billion Norwegian crowns) to US$14 billion (120 billion crowns).



“The market for renewable energy is growing rapidly. A major part of the renewable energy investment opportunities is found in the unlisted market, especially in unlisted infrastructure projects. Expectations of significant investments going forward mean that this market is of interest to institutional investors such as the Government Pension Fund Global,” according to the Norwegian government.“We are not stipulating that the Fund shall be invested in unlisted renewable energy infrastructure, but are enabling Norges Bank to make such investments if deemed profitable,” Norway’s Finance Minister Siv Jensen said.Related: Is This The End Of Colorado’s Shale Boom?



The world’s largest sovereign wealth fund—created three decades ago to safeguard and manage Norway’s oil wealth for future generations—made headlines last month, when the government proposed that the fund divest from oil and gas exploration companies.The move by the Norwegian government and the fund comes at a time when investors are increasingly pressing major oil companies to start taking climate change seriously and to prepare their business portfolios for a world of peak oil demand, whenever that may come.Norway, however, claims that its decision is motivated by financial reasons, with the country aiming to cut exposure to the oil price risk.

Shell and Japan’s Tokyo Gas Co Ltd have signed a long-term liquefied natural gas (LNG) deal, whose price will include a link to coal prices, in an innovative type of LNG contract aimed at diversifying price indexation.Typically, long-term LNG contracts for Asia are linked to the price of oil, while U.S. LNG sales are priced off the U.S. natural gas benchmark Henry Hub.Industry observers told Reuters that the Shell-Tokyo Gas deal is believed to be the first time in which a Japanese LNG customer has used a coal pricing formula in an LNG contract.



According to Christopher Goncalves, chair of the energy practice at Berkeley Research Group, who spoke to Bloomberg, pricing an LNG contract to coal is a kind of a risk management strategy for companies competing with coal-fired power generation and would be attractive in markets with solid shares of coal generation, including the Asian markets Japan, China, and India.Under the heads of agreement, Shell Eastern Trading will supply Tokyo Gas with around 500,000 tons of LNG per year between April 2020 and March 2030, the Japanese company said in a statement on Friday.Shell Eastern Trading and Tokyo Gas have been discussing a new type of LNG agreement that can contribute to creating LNG demand, Tokyo Gas said, noting that “as a result, for the first time among the two companies, Shell and Tokyo Gas have come up with an innovative pricing formula that is based on coal indexation and included this to the agreement.”



“Our broad portfolio enables us to provide reliable LNG supply as well as tailored solutions including flexible contract terms under a variety of pricing indices,” said Steve Hill, Shell’s Executive Vice President said.“With our long-term relationship and joint consideration, we were able to achieve an innovative agreement that would enhance further diversification of price indexation pursued by Tokyo Gas,” said Kentaro Kimoto, Tokyo Gas’s Managing Executive Officer.   By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Oil Hits $70 On Libya Unrest, Crisis In VenezuelaNew Offensive Brings Libya To The Brink Of WarThe World’s Cheapest Natural Gas

Nigeria’s Petroleum Minister Emmanuel Ibe Kachikwu has said that he isn’t aware of any plans of U.S. oil and gas supermajor ExxonMobil to exit upstream operations in OPEC’s African member.ExxonMobil is considering selling some of its stakes in onshore and offshore fields in Nigeria, and those stakes could potentially raise US$3 billion, Reuters reported earlier this week, citing banking and industry sources.  Exxon has recently held talks with Nigerian companies to see if there is interest in its assets in Nigeria, some of Reuters’ sources said, as the U.S. supermajor is now predominantly focused on boosting production in the Permian and developing the huge oil discoveries offshore Guyana.Exxon is set to soon open in Nigeria the so-called data room with details about the oil and gas fields it plans to divest from, one source told Reuters.



According to the sources, Exxon officials have recently discussed with Nigerian companies stakes in onshore oil fields, in which Exxon participates in joint ventures with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). The U.S. major, however, is also mulling over selling stakes in offshore oil fields.Exxon is one of Nigeria’s largest foreign oil operators and its production in 2017 stood at 225,000 bpd.Speaking to reporters at an oil industry event in Nigeria this week, Minister Kachikwu said, as carried by Nigerian outlet The Guardian:“I am not aware of that. I have not been officially informed. You saw the chairman of ExxonMobil today talking about their long-term plan and he didn’t mention that.”



“Obviously, we will engage them, whether this is true or not,” the minister added.“I am connected enough to the ExxonMobil system worldwide and I haven’t seen anything like that. It will be a bit of surprise to me and I would not believe this until I am sure,” The Guardian quoted Kachikwu as saying.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Saudi Arabia Threatens To Drop Dollar For Oil TradesNew Offensive Brings Libya To The Brink Of WarWhy Oil Markets Need New OPEC+ Cuts

Brent Crude prices are expected to average $62.50 a barrel next year, down from $65 this year as slowing global economic growth could impact oil demand growth, Dmitry Marinchenko, senior director at Fitch Ratings, told Reuters in an interview published on Friday.Fitch sees Brent Crude prices falling further down in coming years, to average $57.50 a barrel by 2022.According to the ratings agency, global economic growth will slow down to 2.8 percent this year and next, compared to 3.2-percent growth for 2018.



“If the global growth slowdown becomes more pronounced, or even if recession materialises, then demand for oil could fall sharply, which is the main risk for global oil prices,” Marinchenko told Reuters.Just before OPEC and allies decided in December to launch a new round of production cuts to rebalance the market and support oil prices, Fitch said that “we believe that supply controls will support medium-term oil prices in the range of USD60-USD65 a barrel for Brent crude. In the longer term, we continue to expect prices to fall below USD60/bbl driven by the falls to marginal producers' full-cycle costs.”At the beginning of December, Fitch expected Brent to average $62.50 a barrel in 2020 and $60 per barrel in 2021, reflecting the rating agency’s expectations that OPEC and its Russia-led allies “will manage output to keep average prices above USD60/bbl in the medium term, although its ability to secure prices above USD70/bbl may be limited by US pressure.”



Early on Friday, Brent Crude was just below the $70 mark—at $69.11, down by 0.42 percent on the day at 06:35 a.m. EDT. WTI Crude was down 0.21 percent at $61.97.OPEC and partners are meeting in June to review their pact, and according to Fitch’s Marinchenko, the future of the agreement will largely depend on how much supply Venezuela and Iran will be providing to the market at the time. Quotas may need to be revised and readjusted, as oil production in Venezuela will continue to drop, Marinchenko told Reuters.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Sharp Rise In Rig Count Pressures Oil PricesSaudi Arabia Threatens To Drop Dollar For Oil TradesThe World’s Cheapest Natural Gas

Venezuelan PDVSA expects a sharp decline in oil production this month with the four upgraders operating in the country running a lot lower than capacity, Reuters reports citing company documents and sources close to the company.The four upgraders in Venezuela turn its superheavy crude into liquid crude that can be loaded on tankers and exported. A string of blackouts in the last few weeks, however, have caused extended outages at crucial oil facilities including the upgraders. These have a combined capacity of 700,000 bpd.Now, two of these, Petropiar and Petromonagas, have been idle since early March when the first outage hit sanction-stricken Venezuela. The two upgraders are operated by joint ventures between PDVSA and Chevron and Rosneft, respectively.



The other two—Petrocedeno, co-owned by French Total and Norway’s Equinor and PDVSA’s 100-percent owned Petrosanfelix—shut down in late March. Petrocedeno and Petropiar, however, were in the process of being restarted, the documents seen by Reuters revealed.Despite the upgrader outages, Venezuela exported a solid amount of crude last month, with TankerTrackers.com noting the fast recovery in exports after the outages caused a slump to 650,000 bpd at one point. The average for the month, according to the data provider, stood at  a little over 898,000 bpd, about 100,000 bpd lower than the February figure.The recovery is indeed remarkable because the power outages that crippled an already ailing country also hit Venezuela’s main export terminal, the port of Jose. The terminal remained closed for several days.



Meanwhile, Washington plans to further tighten the sanction noose around Caracas’ neck. Earlier this week, a U.S. official told Reuters “(We will) continue to take action to ensure Venezuela’s energy resources are preserved for the legitimate government of interim president Juan Guaido, for the people of Venezuela, and the reconstruction of a country destroyed through mismanagement and corruption.”By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Saudi Arabia Threatens To Drop Dollar For Oil TradesSupermajor Shell Looks To Revitalize The Rust BeltNew Offensive Brings Libya To The Brink Of War

A New York District Judge ordered the Securities and Exchange Commission and Elon Musk to settle their differences regarding a tweet by the Tesla CEO out of court.“Take a deep breath, put your reasonableness pants on, and work this out,” Reuters quoted Judge Alison Nathan as saying during the hearing.SEC took Musk to court after he tweeted that Tesla will manufacture half a million cars this year. The tweet, however, was quickly followed by another one, clarifying that “Meant to say annualized production rate at end of 2019 probably around 500k, ie 10k cars/week. Deliveries for year still estimated to be about 400k.”



The watchdog immediately turned to the court system, asking Judge Nathan to hold Elon Musk in contempt for violating a deal the regulator struck with the Tesla chief executive last year, which requires him to get the approval of the Tesla board of directors before tweeting anything that could “be material to investors.”In its filing to Judge Nathan, the regulator accused Musk of not asking the approval of Tesla’s board of directors for any tweets posted since the agreement was made. The watchdog said it had asked the Tesla board if the CEO had approached it for approving tweets, and the board responded in the negative.“It is therefore stunning to learn that, at the time of filing of the instant motion, Musk had not sought pre-approval for a single one of the numerous tweets about Tesla he published in the months since the court-ordered pre-approval policy went into effect,” the SEC said in the filing.



Musk first drew the attention of the Securities and Exchange Commission with his tweeting habits last summer when the Tesla CEO said on Twitter he was planning to take the company private and had already secured funding.It was this phrase, “funding secured”, that alerted the Securities and Exchange Commission, which launched a probe into this claim, prompting Musk to come forward with the revelation that he had for years been in talks with the Saudi sovereign wealth fund to take the company private.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Supermajor Shell Looks To Revitalize The Rust BeltNew Offensive Brings Libya To The Brink Of WarWhy Oil Markets Need New OPEC+ Cuts

Chevron Canada has emerged victorious from a bitter battle over a decades-old court case in which thousands of Ecuadorian residents collectively sued Chevron for alleged water and soil contamination. The Supreme Court refused on Thursday to hear a request to review a lower court decision, rendering a final verdict that dismissed all claims against Chevron Canada Limited, according to The Progress.While final in Canada, the case may not be final everywhere.In the case that just won’t die, the lawsuit has imposed on various courts in various jurisdictions for decades, and the lawsuit may still find its way into other courts in other states.



A US appeals court in 2016 blocked the enforcement of the $9.5 billion judgement handed down by an Ecuadorian court against Chevron. The US appeals court supported a lower court ruling in 2014 that found the case against Chevron, initiated in an Ecuadorean court, was the product of fraud and racketeering, complete with fraudulent evidence and bribery of the Ecuadorean judge.Undeterred by the two lower court rulings in the US, the case was submitted to the US Supreme court, which refused to hear the appeal. But the lawyers didn’t stop there, wanting to take even more stabs at the lawsuit by trying the case in Canada, this time targeting Chevron’s Canadian arm.  It also tried its hand in Gibraltar, Brazil, and Argentina, also to no avail. Even the Hague has heard the case. It, too, ruled in Chevron’s favor, saying that the fraudulent Ecuadorian judgement “violates international public policy” and “should not be recognised or enforced by the courts of other States.”The Hague ruling holds Ecuador liable for cost or damage to Chevron if the judgement were to be enforced anywhere in the world.



Chevron has never even operated in Ecuador, but it purchased Texaco Petroleum in 2001, and TexPet—together with state-owned Petroecuador, operated there between 1964 and 1992. TexPet disentangled itself from Ecuador in 1992, returning its share in the projects to Petroecuador. Chevron says that TexPet spent millions remedying the area now under dispute, adding that it had been fully released from further liability in 1998 by Ecuador.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads from Oilprice.com:New Offensive Brings Libya To The Brink Of WarWhy Oil Markets Need New OPEC+ CutsShale Is In A Deep State Of Flux

While Tesla was working hard to ramp up production of Model 3, the EV maker faced challenges in deliveries and its total vehicle deliveries in the first quarter slumped by 31 percent from the previous quarter and were well below analyst estimates.Tesla delivered around 63,000 vehicles in Q1, up by 110 percent compared to the first quarter of 2018, but 31 percent lower than the vehicles delivered in Q4 2018, the EV maker said in a statement.Of the total 63,000 vehicles delivered in Q1 2019, some 50,900 were Model 3 and 12,100 were Models S and X.



“Due to a massive increase in deliveries in Europe and China, which at times exceeded 5x that of prior peak delivery levels, and many challenges encountered for the first time, we had only delivered half of the entire quarter’s numbers by March 21, ten days before end of quarter. This caused a large number of vehicle deliveries to shift to the second quarter. At the end of the first quarter, approximately 10,600 vehicles were in transit to customers globally,” Tesla said.The carmaker warned that the lower-than-expected deliveries will impact its bottom line in Q1, but tried to appease the market that it ended Q1 “with sufficient cash on hand.”“Because of the lower than expected delivery volumes and several pricing adjustments, we expect Q1 net income to be negatively impacted. Even so, we ended the quarter with sufficient cash on hand,” Tesla said.



Analysts had expected Tesla’s total Q1 deliveries to be upwards of 70,000 vehicles at the very least and were quite disappointed with the delivery numbers.“Tesla’s 1Q19 vehicle production & deliveries report was substantially worse than expected,” CNBC quoted J.P. Morgan analyst Ryan Brinkman as saying in a note to clients.The market was also disappointed, with Tesla shares sinking nearly 9 percent at 10:33 a.m. EDT.  By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Shale Is In A Deep State Of FluxWhy Oil Markets Need New OPEC+ CutsWhat’s Next For Algeria As Bouteflika Steps Down

The Q1 plunge in the deals’ value comes after the full-2018 deal value hit a four-year high of US$82 billion, Drillinginfo said.“The market for upstream deals came to a halt in late 2018 with the combined pullback in oil prices and equities,” Drillinginfo M&A Analyst Andrew Dittmar said, commenting on the analysis.“Since then, oil has rebounded by 20 percent and E&P stocks are up 15 percent, albeit with nearly all those stock price gains taking place in early January. However, deals haven’t returned in a meaningful way and we believe that is being largely driven by Wall Street,” Dittmar noted.The key reasons for the 10-year-low in deal value were the 40-percent slump in oil prices at the end of 2018, pressure from Wall Street for oil and gas companies to deliver free cash flows, and weak debt and equity markets for funding M&A deals, according to Drillinginfo.



Looking forward to Q2, Drillinginfo expects the deal-making in U.S. oil and gas to remain slow and subdued, yet with some rebound this quarter.“In theory, the current struggles of smaller E&Ps sets the stage for consolidation, with larger players able to leverage premium valuations and operating efficiencies to acquire smaller competitors. Whether these operators will step up remains to be seen,” Drillinginfo Senior Director Brian Lidsky said. By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:No, You Can’t Get Paid To “Go Solar”: Beware Of Energy ScamsShale Is In A Deep State Of FluxExpect An Extension Of Iran Sanction Waivers

Tanzania’s government will start this month talks with major international firms to define the commercial terms for a deepwater liquefied natural gas (LNG) project off the coast of the east African country expected to be worth US$30 billion.Negotiations are set to begin this month and to conclude by September, The East African news outlet quoted Tanzania’s Energy Ministry as saying.Major international companies have been exploring for gas offshore Tanzania and have found sufficient quantities for a potential LNG plant.The development of such project, however, has been stalled due to the lack of a host government agreement (HGA) setting the legal, fiscal, and commercial terms of the project.



“A deep-water LNG plant is a large project that requires large upfront investments. To ensure that all parties benefit from such a project, a stable and predictable framework for more than 30 years of the plant is essential,” Equinor spokesperson Erick Haaland told The East African.“We trust that the government of Tanzania has a long-term view on this major industrial investment,” Haaland added.Norway’s Equinor has been operating in Tanzania since 2007 when it signed a Production Sharing Agreement (PSA) for Block 2 with Tanzania Petroleum Development Corporation (TPDC). Equinor’s Tanzanian unit is the operator of the block with a 65-percent participating interest, while U.S. ExxonMobil is partner with a 35-percent working interest. TPDC has the right to participate with a 10-percent stake.Equinor has made nine discoveries with estimated volumes of more than 20 Tcf of gas in place.



Royal Dutch Shell holds stakes in two blocks adjacent to Equinor’s block 2. According to Shell’s website, “all these blocks together hold sufficient gas to enable a shared onshore LNG liquefaction plant.”The government of Tanzania has allocated land for this facility in Lindi, located on the southern Tanzanian coast.Now the government and the international majors need to hammer out the legal and commercial framework of the LNG project, which Tanzania says would be done by September.

French oil and gas supermajor Total aims to capture more of the growing Chinese battery and liquefied natural gas (LNG) markets and has just struck two separate deals to gain market shares in the world’s largest electric vehicle (EV) market and the world’s top LNG demand center.Total’s subsidiary Saft has signed an agreement with China’s privately held Tianneng Group to create a joint venture (JV) to expand their lithium-ion battery production, the supermajor said on Thursday.Manufacturing will take place at the Changxing Gigafactory, with a potential capacity of 5.5 gigawatt hours (GWh), several GWh of which are already in operation.



The joint venture will focus on the development, manufacturing, and sales of advanced Li-ion cells, modules, and packs for the Chinese and global markets, targeting the e-bikes, EVs, and Energy Storage Solutions (ESS) markets.“This JV will allow us to make a step change and significantly increase our footprint in the Chinese Li-ion market that will represent over 40% of the global demand by 2025 and to develop our worldwide activities,” Saft CEOGhislain Lescuyer said.



In a separate deal announced earlier this week, Total and Guanghui International Natural Gas Trading Co—a subsidiary of Xinjiang-based integrated energy company Guanghui Energy Co—signed a long-term deal under which Total will provide LNG for a period of 10 years to Guanghui’s regasification terminal in Qidong, Jiangsu Province.The LNG will be sourced from Total’s global LNG portfolio, which the French group aims to significantly grow in the coming years. Total holds a 10-percent share of the global LNG market, it said in the statement.“This new supply contract is in line with Total’s strategy to expand its presence in the Chinese LNG market, which grew by over 41% in 2018 and will continue to be a key driver of the LNG markets growth in the future,” Laurent Vivier, Senior Vice-President Gas at Total, said.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:China Can’t Get Enough Of Brazilian CrudeTrump Battles For Key Oil & Gas ProjectsReuters: OPEC’s Oil Production Drops To Lowest Since 2015

Nigeria’s Petroleum Minister Emmanuel Ibe Kachikwu admitted that reducing oil production to the quota assigned by OPEC is a challenge, not least because of the start of production at the Egina oil field.The offshore field will have a capacity of 150,000 bpd but, Kachikwu said, “We’re not there yet.”Still, Nigeria is hoping the oil production cut deal OPEC agreed with its non-member partners led by Russia will be extended for another six months beyond the June deadline, Kachikwu told local media.



Interestingly, Nigeria doesn’t have much to do with the success of the deal, which has helped Brent climb to almost US$70.  According to Bloomberg data, the West African country pumped some 1.92 million bpd in March, up by 90,000 bpd from February. Kachikwu, however, said production in March averaged 1.7 million bpd, slightly above the OPEC quota of 1.685 million bpd.OPEC agreed to take 800,000 bpd off the market last December, with Russia and several other producers agreed to remove an additional 400,000 bpd for a total cut of 1.2 million bpd. Exempt from the previous cuts agreed in 2016, Nigeria had to be convinced to join these cuts, which Saudi Arabia took care of.According to the Nigerian Petroleum Minister, the deal had succeeded in propping up prices “to a point where both consumers and producers are at least a bit comfortable. I would like to see that go on.” 



Some large importers would probably disagree that prices above US$60 for Brent are comfortable for everyone, but most sellers are certainly happier at this price level. There is doubt, however, that Russia will agree to an extension since it doesn’t need oil to be as expensive as most Middle East producers do. There have been reports that Moscow may only agree to a three-month extension, which would weigh on prices.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads from Oilprice.com:China Can’t Get Enough Of Brazilian CrudeTrump Battles For Key Oil & Gas ProjectsReuters: OPEC’s Oil Production Drops To Lowest Since 2015

Gender bias could have a link to climate change, a new study has suggested, with men who perceive their masculinity as threatened by a certain choice more likely to respond to the perceived threat by making an environmentally bad choice.Forbes author Caroline Centeno Milton reports that the study, co-authored by researcher Aaron Brough from Utah State University and fellows from another four academic institutions, looked the possible relationship between gender and sustainable decision-making.The researchers conducted seven experiments involving more than 2,000 participants and found that the environmentally responsible behavior tended to be perceived as more feminine by both those who engaged in it and those who observed it.



Such “feminine” behavior was supposedly seen as a threat to the masculinity of a significant enough number of the male participants to lead the researchers into suggesting gender stereotypes and their effects spread to things like environmentally responsible or irresponsible behavior.In one of the experiments, for example, the participants had to recall an experience in which they’d done something positive or negative for the environment. The ones that recalled a pro-environment experience rated themselves as more ‘feminine” than the ones that recalled an anti-environment experience.What’s more, male participants seemed more concerned with the maintenance of their masculine identity, which could also explain the not-too-environmentally good choices they made in the experiments.



The results were apparently consistent across the experiments, leading the authors to conclude gender identity was a factor in behavior that could influence the sustainability of choices we make regardless, it seems, of what area we make this choices in.The authors have called what they’ve observed the Green-Feminine Stereotype. In the abstract to their study, originally published in 2016, they note “evidence that the concepts of greenness and femininity are cognitively linked and shows that, accordingly, consumers who engage in green behaviors are stereotyped by others as more feminine and even perceive themselves as more feminine.”By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Read From Oilprice.com:Goldman Sachs: U.S. Drillers Aren’t Hedging EnoughThe One Thing That Could Derail The U.S. Oil BoomChina’s Power Play To Get Its Hands On Foreign Oil

Two South Korean refiners have bought an unspecified amount of U.S. superlight to test it as a potential replacement for Iranian condensate, Reuters reports, citing sources. The country is currently negotiating an extension of the sanction waiver Washington granted it last November.Whatever the outcome of those negotiations, South Korean refiners are preparing for low Iranian condensate intake as the U.S. plans to reduce the amount of oil it permits Iranian oil buyers to continue importing in line with its goal to cut the country’s oil exports to zero.The buyers of the U.S. light, the source said, are South Korea’s largest refiner, SK Energy, and its smallest one, Hyundai Oilbank.



“The crude’s API seems to be 48 degrees so in a way it’s possible (to replace Iranian condensate) but again we need to check the oil’s quality,” Reuters quoted one of its sources as saying.South Korea is a major importer of Iranian condensate, but light crude from the U.S. shale patch—especially the Permian—is comparable in terms of properties. The light grades are used to produce naphtha, a feedstock for petrochemicals.According to the Reuters sources, the seller of the light crude is Anadarko, although the company did not confirm this particular export. A spokesman only said Anadarko was exporting West Texas Light and added the company expected that “those volumes will continue to grow in the future.”



South Korea is already a big buyer of U.S. crude, not least because it’s close political ties to Washington and a willingness to keep things this way. According to a recent analysis from S&P Global Platts, it could import up to 40 million barrels of U.S. crude in the first half of this year alone, especially since U.S. light crude has become cheaper than heavier Saudi grades that the country had been importing.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:China Can’t Get Enough Of Brazilian CrudeSupermajor Shell Looks To Revitalize The Rust BeltShale Is In A Deep State Of Flux

German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier received on Wednesday the symbolic ‘last piece of black coal,’ marking the end of Germany’s two centuries of hard black coal production, while the country struggles to keep up with European peers in curbing emissions.Germany closed its last black coal mine in December 2018.In January this year, Germany became the latest large European economy to lay out a plan to phase out coal-fired power generation, aimed at cutting carbon emissions—a metric in which Berlin has been lagging in recent years.



A government-appointed special commission at Europe’s largest economy announced the conclusions of its months-long review and proposed Germany to shut all its 84 coal-fired power plants by 2038. While Germany will mostly seek to replace coal capacity with renewables, the country’s suppliers of natural gas expect to benefit from the coal exit because natural gas-fired capacity could offer steady supply.Germany, where coal hard coal and lignite combined currently provide around 35 percent of power generation, has a longer timetable for phasing out coal than the UK and Italy, for example—who plan their coal exit by 2025—not only because of its vast coal industry, but also because Germany will shut down all its nuclear power plants within three years.



The government ordered in 2011 the immediate shutdown of eight of its 17 reactors in the wake of the Fukushima disaster in Japan, and plans to phase out nuclear by 2022.The closure of all nuclear reactors in Germany by 2022 means that Germany might need to retain half of its coal-fired power generation until 2030 to offset the nuclear phase-out, German Economy and Energy Minister Peter Altmaier said earlier this year.According to the coal commission’s phase-out proposal—which needs the approval of the government— some 24 coal-fired plants will be shut by 2022. Then, by 2030, Germany is expected to still have eight coal plants operating.

Venezuela exported a little over 980,000 bpd on average in March despite a string of severe blackouts, Reuters reported, citing documents from state oil company PDVSA and its own data.The blackouts suspended operations at Venezuela’s largest oil export terminal Jose and, according to TankerTrackers.com, caused a slump in exports to 650,000 bpd, the co-founder of the tanker data provider, Samir Madani, told Reuters. The catchup, according to Madani, was impressive.Source: TankerTrackers.com



This suggests PDVSA, against all odds, was able to quickly ramp up shipments when power was restored.The Reuters figures are higher than those from Kpler, a France-based energy commodity shipments tracking provider, which calculated Venezuelan March exports at an average daily of 928,000. However, Kpler estimated these had fallen by 355,000 bpd from February, dipping below 1 million bpd for the first time in more than five years.Reuters numbers for February had Venezuela’s average daily oil exports at 990,355 bpd.TankerTrackers.com calculated the March decline from February at around 100,000 bpd, from over 995,470 bpd in February to 898,383 bpd in March, Madani told Oilprice.Related: Did Aramco Just Open Pandora’s Box?



The bulk of what Venezuela exported last month went to China, India, and Singapore: these three destinations constituted 74 percent of PDVSA’s oil exports in March. That’s up from 70 percent in February, Reuters noted.As the South American country grapples with its numerous problems, the U.S. plans to tighten the sanction noose around it soon. Beginning in May, importers of Venezuelan crude that use U.S. subsidiaries in their transactions with PDVSA or the U.S. banking system would have to stop buying the commodity as a grace period granted by Washington to these entities expires.“(We will) continue to take action to ensure Venezuela’s energy resources are preserved for the legitimate government of interim president Juan Guaido, for the people of Venezuela, and the reconstruction of a country destroyed through mismanagement and corruption,” a U.S. official told Reuters earlier this week. What’s more, Washington was considering extending the sanctions to non-U.S. companies buying Venezuelan oil even if they do not use the U.S. banking system.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:The Country Where Electric Cars Outsell Petrol CarsVolkswagen Eyes Electric Pivot Amid Growing CriticismTexas Natural Gas Prices Plunge To All-Time Low

U.S. Congress should debate whether to reduce the emergency crude oil stored in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR), because America’s oil production boom has diminished its reliance on imports, U.S. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry said at a Senate hearing on Tuesday.“Do we need that big of a reserve, particularly with the growth of the pipeline infrastructure we have and the growth in that infrastructure that’s going to occur over the next decade?” Reuters quoted Secretary Perry as saying at a hearing before the U.S. Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.The Strategic Petroleum Reserve is a U.S. Government complex of four sites with deep underground storage caverns created in salt domes along the Texas and Louisiana Gulf Coasts.



As of March 29, 2019, the SPR held a total of 649.1 million barrels of crude oil, including 254.6 million barrels of sweet crude and 394.5 million barrels of sour crude oil.The current storage capacity of the SPR is 713.5 million barrels.The SPR was set up in the 1970s when the Arab oil embargo created a fuel crisis in the United States.



According to Secretary Perry, the world has changed a lot since the emergency reserve was created, with the U.S. now the world’s top oil producer. Therefore, Congress should consider what the proper size of the reserve should be and whether the administration should rent part of the storage capacity to private companies, Secretary Perry said.  In February, the U.S. Department of Energy said that it planned to sell up to 6 million barrels of crude oil from the SPR, with deliveries taking place in April and May.Although the sale does not appear to be aimed at easing possible supply concerns, deliveries will be taking place around the time in which the U.S. waivers for Iran’s oil customers to continue importing Iranian oil will expire in early May. Venezuela’s oil exports are also likely to have further dropped by that time due to the U.S. sanctions on its oil industry.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Alberta Oil Inventories Rise Despite Production CutsOil Prices Spike On Shale SlowdownNew Energy Tech Is Hot Among Billionaires

Chinese imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) could rise to around 80 million tons by 2025 from 54 million tons in 2018, according to Ling Xiao, a senior official with the China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC).The coal-to-natural gas switch and the rise of the share of gas in China’s energy mix will be the key drivers of growth, Reuters quoted Ling as saying at the LNG2019 conference in Shanghai on Wednesday.China’s breakneck demand surge of the past two years is expected to slow down this year as Beijing is determined to avoid severe shortages by boosting pipeline connectivity, building more storage and import terminals, and raising domestic natural gas production.



“Economic slowdown, a more considered approach on coal-to-gas switching and increased domestic infrastructure availability will mean LNG demand will slow in 2019, from the 40-45% growth we have seen in 2017 and 2018,” energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie said in its 2019 LNG outlook in early January.“But China will still grow at around 20%, by far the largest source of LNG demand growth in the global market,” according to WoodMac.The pace of Chinese import growth will also depend on LNG prices and contracts, because they will have to compete with pipeline gas, according to Ling of CNPC, whose gas imports represent some 60 percent of all of China’s gas imports.



Russia’s giant Gazprom will begin natural gas deliveries to China via the Power of Siberia pipeline ahead of schedule, as early as December 1, 2019, Alexey Miller, Chairman of Gazprom’s Management Committee, said earlier this year.“LNG import prices are not competitive with pipeline gas now, and the opening of the Russia pipeline will pose further threat to LNG imports,” CNPC’s Ling said, as carried by Reuters.Shorter and cheaper LNG contracts are the only way in which LNG can be really competitive to pipeline gas, according to the official.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Oil Falls On Large Crude Inventory BuildOil & Gas Cash Flow Hits All-Time HighTrump Battles For Key Oil & Gas Projects

Following weeks of huge nationwide protests, Algeria’s President of 20 years, Abdelaziz Bouteflika, stepped down from the top office of the oil and gas-rich African nation member of OPEC.Mass protests across Algeria erupted several weeks ago when Bouteflika announced he would run for a fifth term as president. Those protests forced him to rescind that decision, but the momentum against him failed to subside. Instead, it had increased and intended to do so until he steps down entirely.Exxon’s negotiations with Algeria for the development of local shale gas resources are being delayed because of the widespread anti-government protests in the North American country, Reuters reported two weeks ago, citing industry sources.



The report came as no surprise as it comes on the heels of other media reports that energy companies are getting nervous about their Algerian plans amid the unrest and widespread protests in the nation rich in oil and gas.Algeria produces around 1 million barrels of oil per day (bpd). According to the latest available figures by OPEC, Algeria’s crude oil production in February stood at 1.026 million bpd. Under the OPEC+ deal for production cuts, Algeria should reduce its output to 1.025 million bpd, down by 32,000 bpd from its October level of 1.057 million bpd. The North African country is home to the world’s third-largest shale gas reserves, estimated at some 2,000 trillion cu ft, according to the Algerian government. Algeria is already an important gas supplier to Europe and is looking to increase its market share there.



However, the country’s shale gas fields are concentrated in the south, where the population is against gas exploration. Development plans for the area were already stopped once by local protests last year, but Sonatrach, the state energy company, pledged to continue seeking ways to convince the local community leaders that the plans will benefit them.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Alberta Oil Inventories Rise Despite Production CutsOil Prices Spike On Shale SlowdownNew Energy Tech Is Hot Among Billionaires

Canada is not doing enough to reduce its carbon footprint, the federal Environment Commissioner, Julie Gelfand, said in her parting comments.Gelfand, as quoted by the Globe and Mail, said a string of federal governments have failed to advance the country’s efforts in fighting climate change, calling this “disturbing” and calling for more effort to be put in this direction.The failure to live up to promises, however, may be a result of simply too ambitious goals. Canada has committed to reduce its carbon emissions by 30 percent below levels from 2005 and do this by 2030. However, recent calculations suggest it would not be able to fulfill this: emissions will only fall by 19 percent below the 2005 level by 2030.



Gelfand’s comments come on the heels of a federal report on climate that will no doubt stoke the fires of environmentalism. The report said Canada was warming at a rate double the global average and this was most pronounced in the North. What’s more, the authors of the report said many of the changes already visible are irreversible.""While both human activities and natural variations in the climate have contributed to the observed warming in Canada, the human factor is dominant,"" the report said. ""It is likely that more than half of the observed warming in Canada is due to the influence of human activities.""“For decades, successive federal governments have failed to reach their targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and the government is not ready to adapt to a changing climate,” the outgoing Environment Commissioner said.



She went on to add that the Liberal government should have stopped subsidizing the oil industry as the subsidies have made investment in cleaner energy sources more challenging. The Trudeau government promised to phase out fossil fuel subsidies in keeping with a commitment by Canada along with several other countries to dispense with these subsidies by 2025.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Alberta Oil Inventories Rise Despite Production CutsOil Prices Spike On Shale SlowdownNew Energy Tech Is Hot Among Billionaires

Three major Iran oil importers have stopped buying from the sanctioned country ahead of the expiry sanction waivers granted to eight such countries, the U.S. special envoy for Iran, Brian Hook, said as quoted by Reuters.“In November, we granted eight oil waivers to avoid a spike in the price of oil. I can confirm today three of those importers are now at zero,” Hook told media without naming the three countries.Two of the three are most likely Japan and South Korea, which both suspended their purchases of Iranian oil well ahead of the reimposition of the U.S. sanctions in November in anticipation of the waivers they scored with Washington. These waivers, however, did not restart imports of Iranian crude immediately. Eventually, Japan and South Korea restarted imports of Iranian crude in January, for a couple of months.



Japan is currently negotiating an extension of the November waiver and so is South Korea. India is also trying to secure permissions from Washington to continue buying Iranian crude. China has indicated it has no plans to stop importing oil from Iran.There have been reports the U.S. will extend the waivers to at least four of the eight original countries granted exemptions from the sanctions in order to avoid a price shock that would ultimately hurt the Trump administration’s popularity at home. Hook, however, reiterated the “path to zero” goal.“There are better market conditions for us to accelerate our path to zero,” he said. “We are not looking to grant any waivers or exceptions to our sanctions regime.”



“This has denied the regime access to well over $10 billion in (oil) revenue - a loss of at least $30 million a day.” The official added the sanctions had reduced Iranian oil exports by as much as 1.5 million bpd since May last year.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Bullish Hedge Funds Send Oil SoaringThe Next Frontier In Energy StorageOil Hits 2019 High On Shale Slowdown

Worldwide demand for liquefied natural gas (LNG) will increase at a rate of 2 percent every year in the next fifteen years, the chief executive of one of the world’s top LNG providers, Qatar Petroleum, said on Tuesday.“China, along with India, will continue to lead Asia as the main drivers behind the growth of global LNG demand,” Saad Sherida Al-Kaabi, Qatar’s Minister of State for Energy Affairs and President and CEO of Qatar Petroleum, said at the LNG2019 conference in Shanghai.Over the past decade, Qatar Petroleum has delivered more than 50 million tons of LNG to China, which is equal to more than 22 percent of China’s LNG imports in the last ten years, Al-Kaabi said at the conference, as carried in a Qatar Petroleum statement.



Qatar, the world’s top LNG producer, aims to further boost its export capacity to meet growing demand, especially on the Asian market, and to retain its top exporter status which has been challenged lately by Australia and the United States.Qatar Petroleum has already awarded a number of contracts related to Qatar’s LNG expansion project aimed to boost LNG production capacity from 77 million tons now to 110 million tons per year by 2024, the Qatari state firm said today.Related: China Can’t Get Enough Of Brazilian Crude“As the largest LNG producer we are also expanding our capacity in many parts of the world. This includes adding 16 MTA from our Golden Pass LNG export project in the United States with our long-term strategic partner ExxonMobil. This project is under construction and should be in operation by 2024,” Al-Kaabi said.



Qatar Petroleum and ExxonMobil have also set up an international joint venture marketing company, Ocean LNG, which will be responsible for marketing all LNG production from Golden Pass, the Qatari minister added.“Qatar is among the frontrunners developing new low-cost export capacity, based on its huge potential to tap into liquids-rich gas and leverage its vast existing infrastructure complex at Ras Laffan,” the International Energy Agency’s (IEA) World Energy Outlook (WEO) Energy Analysts Peter Zeniewski and Tae-Yoon Kim said in a commentary on the global gas market earlier this year.In the past, gas supply globally was dominated by one major pipeline exporter, Russia, and a single LNG giant provider, Qatar.

French supermajor Total said on Tuesday that it had started up production at the Kaombo Sul oil development, adding 115,000 bpd to bring Total’s overall production capacity to 230,000 bpd, equivalent to 15 percent of Angola’s output.Kaombo Sul is the sister project of Kaombo Norte and the second Floating Production Storage and Offloading (FPSO) unit at the Kaombo project. Total started up production at Kaombo Norte in July last year.“This second FPSO stands out as an excellent example of standardization to reduce costs and improve efficiency. Its start-up will contribute to the Group’s cash flow and production growth in 2019 and beyond,” said Arnaud Breuillac, President Exploration & Production at Total.



Last year, Total’s production in Angola averaged 211,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd).Angola, for its part, has been struggling in recent years to offset a decline in production as many fields mature.After the oil price crash of 2014, Angola’s economy had suffered from the low oil prices and the country had also been struggling to attract international investments in its deepwater higher-breakeven oil resources.



Last year, Angola introduced several new measures to try to boost its oil production and its attractiveness for international investment. President Joao Lourenco signed in the summer of 2018 a decree to create an agency that would sell and manage oil blocks instead of state oil firm Sonangol.Earlier in 2018, Angola halved the tax rates on the development of oil discoveries with fewer than 300 million barrels of reserves. Angola cut the petroleum production tax on so-called marginal fields—those with below 300 million barrels of reserves—to 10 percent from the typical 20 percent tax. The tax reforms also halved the petroleum income tax on marginal fields to 25 percent from 50 percent.According to OPEC’s latest available figures, Angola’s crude oil production averaged 1.457 million bpd in February 2019, up by 22,000 bpd compared to January, despite the fact that under the new OPEC+ deal, Angola’s cap is at 1.481 million bpd—higher than its February production.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Big Oil Is Heading OffshoreFederal Judge Reinstates Ban On Drilling Oil In ArcticExpect Higher Oil Prices As OPEC Clashes With Trump

Russia continued to gradually reduce oil production in March, but it missed its production cut target under the OPEC+ deal, data from Russia’s Energy Ministry showed on Tuesday.As at the end of March, Russia cut its oil production by 225,000 bpd compared to October, excluding output from production sharing agreements (PSAs), while production was reduced by 190,000 bpd from October levels, if PSAs are taken into account, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said in a statement carried by the Energy Ministry. As part of the OPEC+ production cuts between January and June, Russia is taking the lion’s share of the non-OPEC cuts and pledged to reduce production by 230,000 bpd from October’s post-Soviet record level of 11.421 million bpd, to 11.191 million bpd.



Russian production in March stood at 11.298 million bpd, according to energy ministry data in tons, calculated in million bpd by Reuters using a 7.33 barrels/tons ratio.In early March, Novak said that Russia would speed up its oil production cuts and plans to reach its share of the OPEC/non-OPEC output reduction by end-March or early April.Moscow, however, has repeatedly said that due to weather and geological conditions in the cold Russian winter, it cannot cut its oil production too quickly.



In mid-January, Khalid al-Falih, the energy minister of Saudi Arabia—the OPEC kingpin and key Russian ally in all OPEC/non-OPEC production policy deals since early 2017—had said that Russia was moving with the cuts “slower than I’d like.”Russian oil companies are currently sticking to the production cuts through June, but they have not discussed production plans for the second half of the year and have decided that they would do so after April, Vagit Alekperov, president and CEO of Russian oil producer Lukoil, said last month.Last week, reports had it that Russia—always the reluctant actor in OPEC+ cuts extensions—may not support an extension of the deal for the full six months until the end of the year.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Big Oil Is Heading OffshoreFederal Judge Reinstates Ban On Drilling Oil In ArcticExpect Higher Oil Prices As OPEC Clashes With Trump

China’s three state oil and gas companies plan to increase their spending on oil and gas by 20 percent this year, bringing the total to some US$74.4 billion (500 billion yuan) for the first time in five years.Nikkei Asian Review reports PetroChina, CNOOC, and Sinopec sourced foreign oil to satisfy as much as 70 percent of their needs as of 2018, with natural gas dependency on imports at 45 percent. Heeding a call from Beijing to boost the country’s energy security amid ongoing tensions with the United States, the three are now seeking to increase their production both at home and abroad.PetroChina last month said it will increase its spending by 17.4 percent this fiscal year, which the company can accommodate comfortably after it reported a 130-percent rise in net profits for financial 2018. Most of this will go into oil and gas production, at 80 percent, with the company focusing on domestic natural gas production, two LNG projects—in Russia and Canada—and the acquisition of a stake in an oil field in Abu Dhabi.



China’s second-largest oil producer, CNOOC, plans to boost spending to US$10.4-11.9 billion (70-80 billion yuan) from US$9.31 billion (62.6 billion yuan) last year.Sinopec plans a 41-percent increase in investments this year, to almost US$12 billion (80 billion yuan) focusing on oil.China’s oil demand is still on the rise despite short-term worry about depressed economic growth and its effect on this demand, but according to a recent report from Morgan Stanley, it will peak in 2025 as electric vehicle adoption increases. In that, the authors of the report noted, China would be unique among industrialized countries where economic growth has traditionally gone hand in hand with fuel demand growth.



For now, however, demand remains strong and the extent of China’s dependency on imports remains a cause for concern in Beijing.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Reuters: OPEC’s Oil Production Drops To Lowest Since 2015Expect Higher Oil Prices As OPEC Clashes With TrumpBig Oil Is Heading Offshore

ExxonMobil is considering selling some of its stakes in onshore and offshore fields in Nigeria, and those stakes could potentially raise US$3 billion, Reuters reported on Tuesday, citing banking and industry sources.  Exxon has recently held talks with Nigerian companies to see if there is interest in its assets in Nigeria, some of Reuters’ sources said, as the U.S. supermajor is now predominantly focused on boosting production in the Permian and developing the huge oil discoveries offshore Guyana.Exxon is set to soon open in Nigeria the so-called data room with details about the oil and gas fields it plans to divest, one source told Reuters.According to the sources, Exxon officials have recently discussed with Nigerian companies stakes in onshore oil fields, in which Exxon participates in joint ventures with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). The U.S. major, however, is also mulling over selling stakes in offshore oil fields.



Exxon is one of Nigeria’s largest foreign oil operators and its production in 2017 stood at 225,000 bpd.Nigeria, however, has been a difficult international scene for supermajors in recent years with militant violence disrupting export pipelines and streams and pipeline vandalism leading to spills.Exxon is now primarily focused on getting the most out of the Permian and of the Guyana discoveries, which are its key growth areas for the coming years.Exxon plans to significantly boost its earnings and cash flows through 2025, also thanks to asset sales.



“Cumulative cash flow from operations and asset sales over the period from 2019 to 2025 is $24 billion higher than what was communicated at last year’s analyst meeting, including $15 billion from anticipated asset sales from 2019 to 2021,” Exxon said last month.In its Investor Day presentation in early March, one of Exxon’s key upstream messages was to aggressively enhance its portfolio competitiveness by executing industry-leading exploration opportunities, improving operations, and increasing divestments.

Washington is considering the addition of more sanctions against Iran and these could be announced next month, a government official who wished to remain unnamed told Reuters.“We just want a continued chilling effect,” the source said. “We want businesses to continue to think doing business with Iran is a terrible idea at this point,” he added, saying the new sanctions will target new, as of yet unsanctioned sectors of the Iranian economy.



As regards the waivers Washington granted eight Iranian oil importers last November, the official repeated the adage that we’ve been hearing from pretty much everyone in the administration speaking to the media: the goal to bring Iranian oil exports to zero remains the ultimate goal. Extension of the waivers may not be granted even though some importers including India are already negotiating such extensions to keep the flow of cheap Iranian crude coming in.According to the official who spoke to Reuters this week, U.S. crude oil will help plug the hole left by Iranian crude on the international markets, but this is doubtful price-wise: U.S. crude, for geographical and consequently transportation reasons, is costlier than Iranian crude and likely to remain so in the observable future.



This, however, does not mean it is not being bought. South Korea, for one, turned into the biggest buyer of U.S. crude this year despite being granted a sanction waiver. India, however, will be hard pressed to switch from Iranian to U.S. crude: it depends on exports for more than 80 percent of its oil consumption and at this level of import dependency, every cent matters, especially for an emerging economy.Despite Washington’s insistence on the zero Iranian oil exports, most analysts seem to agree that at least five importers will get a waiver extension, including South Korea, China, India, Japan, and Turkey. This would mean Iran will be—officially—exporting 1.1 million bpd next month.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Goldman Sachs: U.S. Drillers Aren’t Hedging EnoughThe One Thing That Could Derail The U.S. Oil BoomChina’s Power Play To Get Its Hands On Foreign Oil

Royal Dutch Shell said on Tuesday that it would be leaving the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers (AFPM) group because of ‘material misalignment’ in climate-related positions—the first major oil and gas group to quit the refining lobby over climate policy disagreements.In its Industry Associations Climate Review published on Tuesday, Shell said that it had reviewed its memberships of industry associations in light of Shell’s climate-related policy positions. Of the 19 associations it reviewed, Shell found that “there was material misalignment with one industry association, American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers (AFPM).”“We have decided not to renew our membership of AFPM in 2020,” the oil major said.Shell’s reasons for quitting AFPM include the association not having stated support for the Paris Agreement, which Shell supports, as well as AFPM’s position that doesn’t support carbon pricing.



“Shell has supported carbon pricing initiatives at the state and federal level, such as the California cap-and-trade programme,” the supermajor said.Shell investor, The Church of England Pensions Board, welcomed the oil and gas group’s decision to leave AFPM.“This is an industry first. With this review Shell have set the benchmark for best practice on corporate climate lobbying not just within the Oil and Gas but across all industries. The challenge now is for others to follow suit,” said Adam Matthews, Director of Ethics and Engagement for the Church of England Pensions Board.Shell was one of the first supermajors to start setting climate goals amid increased investor pressure for transparency.



Last month, Shell announced its first-ever short-term goals to cut the carbon footprint of its operations and product sales as the oil and gas industry is under intense investor and shareholder pressure to address climate change.In December last year, in an industry first, Shell said that it plans to set short-term targets for reducing the net carbon footprint of the energy products it sells, and to link those targets with executive remuneration.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Oil & Gas Cash Flow Hits All-Time HighDid Aramco Just Open Pandora’s Box?Oil Prices Spike On Shale Slowdown

Venezuela’s President Nicolas Maduro announced that he had replaced the country’s electricity minister amid a string of three nationwide blackouts that sparked protests against the lack of basic services including water supply.Reuters quoted Maduro as saying the new minister is an electrical engineer. This, however, is unlikely to help much with the root causes of the crisis, which some observers have attributed to years of underinvestment in power plants and the grid. Maduro himself blamed the first blackout on the United States, calling it sabotage.The news about the new appointment follows an announcement from earlier this week that electricity will be rationed for at least a month following the third blackout in a month. The rationing, Maduro said, will help the authorities deal with the consequences of the power outages.



The blackouts are the latest in a host of woes for the sanction-stricken country. The first one crippled the already ailing economy and paralyzed Venezuela’s oil industry. So did the second one, which shut down the country’s most important oil export terminal, the port of Jose, temporarily suspending vital shipments of oil amid a shrinking client base.This may shrink further as reports emerged last week that Washington was pressuring commodity traders to stop buying Venezuelan crude even if the deals were not in violation of the U.S. sanctions against Venezuela.The country’s oil industry has also suffered from the power outages just when Venezuela needs to export more of its falling production. The blackouts extended from the port of Jose to the four upgraders that process Venezuela’s superheavy crude into a liquid making it fit for exporting.



According to a recent Reuters survey, Venezuela’s production fell by 150,000 bpd as a result of the blackouts, adding to an ongoing decline resulting from a lack of maintenance and seriously aggravated by the U.S. sanctions targeting Venezuela’s oil industry specifically as the main revenue generator for the Maduro government.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Oil Prices Spike On Shale SlowdownDid Aramco Just Open Pandora’s Box?Trump Battles For Key Oil & Gas Projects

Oil-rich Libya, torn between a UN-backed government based in Tripoli and an alternative administration and institutions in the east, could see the years-long political crisis solved this month by the creation of a single government, according to eastern strongman General Khalifa Haftar.Haftar leads a self-styled Libyan National Army (LNA) with a base in the eastern city of Benghazi. LNA is the main opponent of the UN-backed Libyan government based in the capital Tripoli in the west.“Libyans will have a single cabinet this month,” the English version of Arab newspaper Asharq al-Awsat quoted Haftar as saying.This past weekend, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres said that he was hopeful for a solution to the eight-year long conflict in Libya after a high-level meeting in Tunis.



“The UN Secretary-General acknowledged that there are difficulties, but stressed that a window of opportunity has been created by the recent historic meeting in Abu Dhabi between Libya’s Prime Minister, Faiez Serraj, and a key rival military leader, the Commander of the Libyan National Army, Khalifa Haftar,” the UN said in a statement on Saturday.Since the toppling of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011, the division in Libya’s political landscape has resulted in frequent attacks on oil fields and infrastructure from various groups. For years, Libya has been struggling to keep its oil production above 1 million bpd, compared to 1.6 million bpd before the civil war began.Related: Big Tech Joins Renewable Energy Buyers AllianceForces loyal to Haftar control the four oil ports in the so-called Oil Crescent in the east and the major oil fields there.In February, Haftar forces took control over Sharara, the largest oil field in Libya, located in the south and capable of pumping 315,000 bpd.



In early March, the Sharara oil field returned to operations after being closed for production in December, when clashes between militant groups forced the National Oil Corporation (NOC) to declare a force majeure.Sharara has been one of the main reasons why Libya is widely seen as a wild card in global oil price forecasts. Since it accounts for around a third of the country’s total oil output, Sharara, like the export terminals in the Oil Crescent, has become a natural target for various groups vying for power and control over Libya’s oil wealth.

Iran’s Oil Minister Bijan Zangeneh arrived in Moscow on Monday for senior-level talks regarding the global oil market and energy cooperation between Iran and Russia, the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) reported.Zangeneh will be meeting with Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak to discuss energy-related issues, according to Iranian media.Russia, the leader of the non-OPEC group of nations part of the OPEC+ deal, was reportedly the deal broker that convinced Iran to agree to the wording of the production cut deal that began on January 1 and currently expires in June.



Iran, alongside Libya and Venezuela, was exempted from the production cuts at the OPEC/non-OPEC meeting in December, due to the U.S. sanctions on its oil industry.The visit of the Iranian oil minister in Moscow comes a month before the United States is due to decide whether to extend all or some or none of the waivers it had granted to key Iranian oil customers when it re-imposed the sanctions in early November.The U.S. waivers for eight key Iranian oil customers, including China, India, Japan, and South Korea, expire in early May.



While the U.S. Administration says that it continues to pursue zero Iranian oil exports, analysts expect Washington to extend waivers to at least a few of the currently exempted buyers, with reduced volumes allowed under the new waivers, as the Administration wouldn’t want to push oil prices too high.Russian oil companies, on the other hand, are currently sticking to the production cuts through June. The firms have not discussed production plans for the second half of the year and have decided that they would do so after April, Vagit Alekperov, president and CEO of Russian oil producer Lukoil, said last month.Last week, reports had it that Russia—always the reluctant actor in OPEC+ cuts extensions—may not support an extension of the deal for the full six months until the end of the year.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Reuters: OPEC’s Oil Production Drops To Lowest Since 2015Expect Higher Oil Prices As OPEC Clashes With TrumpBig Oil Is Heading Offshore

Tesla’s Model 3 has started to reach eastern European countries like Poland, where electric vehicle (EV) are not as popular as they are in Western European countries like Norway for example, in part due to their prices.Since Tesla started overseas shipments of its most affordable sedan Model 3 earlier this year, at least 10 such models have been delivered to Poland over the past three weeks, Tomek Ga?, one of the first owners of an EV in Poland and an EV consultant for companies, reports for CleanTechnica.Tesla began shipments of Model 3 to Europe in early February this year, with countries in Western Europe the first markets to receive Model 3s.



While it will take time for deliveries in Eastern Europe to take off, Norway—Europe’s EV leader—saw Model 3 registrations at a total of 6,129 vehicles as of April 1, according to teslastats.no.Last year, nearly one in three new car sales in Norway were pure EVs, with the EVs share at 31.2 percent, while the EVs and plug-ins total share stood at 49.1 percent, in a nation with a population of just over 5 million people. Tesla Model 3 topped the global EV sales ranking compiled by CleanTechnica and EV Volumes for 2018. In fact, Tesla as a brand dominated the top 5, with all three of its models there. The Nissan Leaf and BAIC EC-Series were also among the top five EVs sold in 2018.



In absolute terms, Tesla Model 3 sales topped 140,000, with Chinese BAIC’s EC-Series at about 90,000 vehicles and the Nissan Leaf slightly lower than that. Tesla challengers from BMW, Toyota, Renault, and Mitsubishi were far down the list.The ranking suggests that the Model 3 may indeed turn out to be the car that will tip Tesla’s fortunes into positive territory, after a string of mass production delays and an even longer string of quarterly losses reported by Tesla.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Goldman Sachs: U.S. Drillers Aren’t Hedging EnoughThe One Thing That Could Derail The U.S. Oil BoomChina’s Power Play To Get Its Hands On Foreign Oil

President Donald Trump has circumvented a court order blocking the authorization of the controversial Keystone XL oil pipeline project and has issued a permit for the project.Preliminary work on Keystone XL ground to a halt last October after a Montana district court judge who ordered the suspension of construction work on the Keystone XL pipeline on the grounds that violations were made in the government’s environmental review.The court has asked the government to review its assessment and revise it, taking into account the changes in the oil markets since 2014, the latest in climate change, and the presence of “cultural resources” along the route of the pipeline that was planned to carry heavy oil from Alberta to U.S. refineries.



The 830,000 bpd pipeline will run from the Albertan oil sands through Montana and South Dakota, ending in Nebraska, where it would connect to the existing pipeline network that goes on to the Gulf Coast. The court’s ruling came a little more than a month after TransCanada said that construction of the pipeline could begin in 2019. The company has still not made the final investment decision on the pipeline.Now, according to a financial analyst who spoke to Bloomberg, President Trump has invalidated the environmental assessment review process by issuing this new permit.



“It looks like the intent is to wipe the slate clean and replace the previous presidential permit with this new one,” Katie Bays from Height Securities said.Across the border, Canada’s National Energy Board in January approved some minor preliminary work on the project that would make life a little bit easier for Albertan oil producers by boosting export capacity. The work would include tree and foliage clearing around parts of the route that the pipeline will follow, NEB’s approval came after TransCanada made a request to perform the clearing works.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Saudi Aramco Gets High First-Ever Credit RatingsTrump’s Foreign Energy Policy Could Haunt Him In 2020Big Oil Is Heading Offshore

Venezuela’s president Nicolas Maduro announced 30 days of electricity rationing after a third blackout hit the struggling South American country. The Associated Press quotes Maduro as saying on Sunday the rationing would help the government deal with the blackouts that have also affected adversely water supply and communications.They also sparked protests, reinforced by calls to people to take to the streets by National Assembly president and opposition leader Juan Guaido. Guaido called on Venezuelans to go out and protest the lack of basic services caused by the blackouts. Maduro, for his part, has blamed the first major blackout that sank Venezuela into darkness for days on the U.S., calling it a sabotage attempt seeking to topple him from power.



According to local reports, the police were peaceful but groups of Maduro supporters called colectivos had been dispersing protesters in some parts of Caracas with threats and gun shots. Maduro has called on the colectivos and other government supports to keep the peace amid the blackouts.The blackouts are the latest in a host of woes for the sanction-stricken country. The first one crippled the already ailing economy and paralyzed Venezuela’s oil industry. So did the second one, which shut down the country’s most important oil export terminal, the port of Jose, temporarily suspending vital shipments of oil amid a shrinking client base.



This may shrink further as reports emerged last week that Washington was pressuring commodity traders to stop buying Venezuelan crude even if the deals were not in violation of the U.S. sanctions against Venezuela.The blackouts are also wreaking havoc on production—already in decline—as the heavy crude upgraders that turn Venezuela’s extra heavy oil into a liquid transportable by tankers also shut down where there is no power. Backup generation capacity has proven difficult to come by judging by the fact that the second outage shut down Jose and the upgraders for several days.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Sources: Saudis Admit They Want $70 OilTrump Boosts U.S. Presence In Taiwan StraitWorld’s 2nd Largest Oil Company Sees Huge Drop In Profit

Crude oil will remain in the range between US$65 a barrel and US$75 a barrel, according to the Omani oil minister, Mohammed bin Hamad al-Rumhy. Reuters quoted a report by Oman’s state news agency as saying the minister had reiterated the country’s commitment to the OPEC+ production cut agreement.A Brent crude price of US$75 per barrel would be welcome news for Saudi Arabia, but not so welcome to its most important ally in the OPEC+ agreement: Russia. Unlike Saudi Arabia, which needs much higher prices to make its budget work this year, Russia is in fact better off with cheaper oil as it would stimulate more exports.



So far, Moscow has played along, though there have been indications that the playing along has been a bit reluctant and reports from Russia have confirmed the reluctance: the state oil companies and Lukoil would much rather expand production than cut it. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia is trying to convince its partners to extend the cuts beyond June.According to Reuters, Russia may be willing to continue cutting, but not until the end of the year as Saudi Arabia would prefer it. Three months is what Russia is more likely to agree to and this will likely have an effect on prices once it is reported. If the world’s second-largest producer of oil decides to pull out of the cut deal altogether, a price slump would be inevitable.Related: US Oil Production Dips For First Time In Nearly Six Months



Last month, Goldman Sachs said it expected OPEC and its partners to reduce global supply sufficiently by April, using what commodities chief Jeffrey Currie called a “shock and awe” strategy. This would push prices above US$70 a barrel, Currey said at the time, before OPEC announced how it would wind down the cuts without shocking the market.Extending the cuts into the second half of the year would help keep them higher but the extension is far from certain as Saudi Arabia would need to convince some of its fellow OPEC members such an extension is indeed in everybody’s best interest and not just the Kingdom’s.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Expect Higher Oil Prices As OPEC Clashes With TrumpThe Oil Rally Is Set To ContinueBig Oil Is Heading Offshore

A study has suggested Caucasian Americans’ diet is contributing significantly more to climate change than the diets of other demographic groups in the country. The study, published in the Journal of Industrial Ecology, said white people contributed the most to greenhouse gas emissions, at 680 kg of carbon dioxide equivalent annually, but added that the Black demographic had the highest contribution to land impacts related to food.The study set out to “fill in the gaps” in research about how various dietary habits affect the environment along the whole supply chain from land resources to water and energy. It focused on three demographic groups—White, non-Hispanic Back, and Latino—since they represent 92.4 percent of the U.S. population and looked into their eating habits to glean some insight into the relation between these habits and what it calls the food-energy-water nexis.



The study’s authors note that the White population, as portion of the U.S. total, was 61.3 percent, with Latinx—a term the authors of the study call intersectional and non-binary to reflect the latest term trends in social sciences—accounting for 17.8 percent and the Black population accounting for 13.3 percent.In light of these proportions it’s hardly surprising the White population’s diet was a greater contributor to climate change in terms of greenhouse emissions. However, the study also suggested that the White group’s diet was a greater contributor to climate change because of its higher consumption of what the authors call “environmentally intense” food items.



“Results indicate that Whites tend to consume the highest rates of environmentally intense food items, except for the apples food item, when compared to their Black and Latinx counterparts,” the authors wrote. “Comparing Whites to Latinx, Whites consume significantly more than Latinx for five of the seven environmentally intense food items. This pattern remains the same for beef meat although the difference between Whites and Latinx beef meat is marginally significant.”By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Expect Higher Oil Prices As OPEC Clashes With TrumpA Perfect Opportunity In Oil Tankers?US Oil Production Dips For First Time In Nearly Six Months

Venezuela’s largest oil export terminal is has resumed operations and is now operating at 100 percent capacity after a blackout took it offline earlier in the week, according to Reuters sources, but chances are its problems are not over just yet.The most recent blackout was the second such blackout in about as many weeks, straining an already strained oil industry that serves as the lifeblood of Venezuela. The first blackout in early March shuttered the Jose oil port—Venezuela’s largest—after the Guri dam hydropower plant, supposedly responsible for supplying nearly 80% of the country with power, went offline.



Some oil production, too, was shut in as a result of both blackouts, which the Maduro regime claims was an act of sabotage at the hands of the United States.While the scale of the recent blackouts is profound, Venezuela’s power blackouts are nothing new, and most experts agree that the blackouts are likely the result of the severe neglect of its infrastructure that has gone on for many years.  Hugo Chavez and Nicolas Maduro both were forced to take extreme measures to deal with its power problems, including altering time zones to get the most out of daylight hours, instituting bans on electricity-heavy appliances such as clothes and hair driers, and entire public-sector shutdowns.



The recent string of power blackouts not only choked off Venezuela’s only real revenue stream—crude oil—it plunged its citizenry into a whole new brand of horror as hospitals went without power and food supplies came up short.It is unlikely with its oil revenue stream drying up that Venezuela will have the funds to invest in its failing critical infrastructure without the aid of a foreign entity with a large wallet. Even its foreign oil interests are no longer providing it with a revenue stream as new sanctions are restricting financial transactions from its partnerships in both Jamaica and Dominican Republic oil refineries.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads from Oilprice.com:Sources: Saudis Admit They Want $70 OilTrump’s Last Chance To Subdue Gasoline PricesOil Rig Count Falls As WTI Hits $60

Unable to secure a waiver extension from Washington to continue buying Iranian oil, Japanese refineries are putting the brakes on further imports in order to give payments enough time to be processed under the existing waiver.In total, Japanese refiners purchased over 15 million barrels of Iranian crude from January through March, but the waiver expires in early May and payments still have to be processed for those cargoes, Reuters reports, citing industry sources and data from Refinitiv Eikon.In order to avoid sanctions violations, all necessary transactions with banks and insurance companies must be finalized before the waiver expires, with the last cargo set to arrive in Japan on April 9.



A handful of countries have received waivers from Washington since sanctions were imposed on Iran, including Japan, China, India, Italy, Greece, Turkey, Taiwan, and South Korea. Iraq also received a waiver to continue importing electricity and natural gas from Iran. Earlier this month, Washington renewed that 90-day waiver.In the meantime, anonymous sources cited by Bloomberg indicate that the extension of sanctions waivers has become a hotly disputed topic in the corridors of Washington, with infighting between the National Security Council and the U.S. State Department growing as the expiration of the current sanction waivers draws near. The NSC camp, led by John Bolton, is lobbying for an end to waivers entirely; while the DoS camp, led by Mike Pompeo, is calling for waiver extensions for allies in need.Related: The One Thing That Could Derail The U.S. Oil Boom



Nonetheless, yesterday, Brian Hook, the State Department’s special representative for Iran, told VOA that the “policy of the United States is that we are not looking to grant any new oil waivers”.“We did have to grant eight oil waivers in order to avoid shocking the global oil markets and causing a dramatic increase in the price of oil. We have taken off roughly 1½ million barrels of Iranian crude, and we have avoided a price increase in oil. And that’s not an accident. We’ve done it very well and very carefully. 2019 is going to be a much better market for global oil supply, and the forecasters say that there will be more supply than demand. That gives us much better market conditions to accelerate our path to zero imports,” Hook said.By Damir Kaletovic for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Oil Rig Count Falls As WTI Hits $60New Middle East Alliance Shakes World PowersChina’s Power Play To Get Its Hands On Foreign Oil

Shell’s 400,000 bpd Pernis oil refinery in the Netherlands will see a reduction in output beginning on April 8, organized by striking workers seeking higher wages.Last week, the Dutch CNV labor union had given Shell seven days to meet their demands before announcing a strike. That deadline ended on Thursday night, and the union is now making good on its promise.According to the union, output will be reduced at both Pernis and the Moerdijk chemical plant beginning on April 8, Reuters reported Friday.



The union has given no indications of the amount of output reduction, but Pernis is the largest oil refinery in Europe, and the point is to reduce output to a level that would force Shell to meet demands for higher wages.Shell had launched major maintenance on 13 refinery units in late January, and that was scheduled to wrap up by the end of this month, according to Platts. It is unclear whether striking workers are intending to explicitly cut output or to refuse to close out maintenance work in order to resume full capacity production.Platts also cited Shell as saying that it had made a “fair wage offer” to workers at both facilities, which included an average 4-percent increase; however, the union is holding out for a 5-percent increase every year.



Last month, the union said that Shell had offered a 2.5-percent salary increase for 2019 and another 2-percent increase for 2020. Speaking of the ultimatum to Shell, CNV director Piet Verburg said that “of course, there will still be technical consultation on this, because a chemical company must be shut down extremely carefully. … The intention is to hit them, for example by reversing production.”Shell has just launched a new unit at Pernis in October last year to enhance performance and ostensibly reduce environmental impact by enabling the processing of more oil into cleaner transportation fuels.By Damir Kaletovic for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:China’s Mad Scramble To Boost Domestic Oil ProductionSources: Saudis Admit They Want $70 OilTrump’s Last Chance To Subdue Gasoline Prices

The Governor of Michigan, Gretchen Whitmer, has ordered the suspension of all work on a tunnel beneath the Straits of Mackinac that’s part of a project for the replacement of a section of the Line 5 crude oil pipeline operated by Enbridge.The order followed an opinion by the state’s new Attorney General, Dana Nessel, who said the bill that allowed the construction of the tunnel violated the state constitution because “it went beyond what the bill’s title reflected,” the Associated Press reports. The AG’s opinion has the force of a law unless a court overrules it, the AP notes.Enbridge issued a response, stating “Enbridge worked in good faith with the Michigan government on the tunnel project,” adding, “We disagree with the Attorney General’s opinion and continue to believe in the benefits of the tunnel.”



The pipeline producer also noted that the project could help bt 'reducing the chance of a release of product to virtually zero,' 'preventing an anchor strike from a ship in the Straits of Mackinac,' and 'ensuring Michigan will continue to receive the economic benefits from Line 5.'Last December, The Michigan Legislature approved the Great Lakes pipeline project that envisages the replacement of a section of Enbridge’s Line 5 pipeline, which is 65 years old, and agreed to set up a state authority to oversee the construction of a tunnel for a section of the new pipeline.The new pipeline will replace two old ones and be set in a tunnel, to be drilled at a depth of 100 feet under the four-mile Straits of Macinac linking Lake Huron and Lake Michigan. As part of the deal, Enbridge will pay between US$350 and US$500 million for the construction of the tunnel for the pipeline. The project could take between 7 and 10 years to complete.Related: Russia Balks At Continued Oil Production Cut Alliance with OPEC



Former Governor Rick Snyder was quick to secure support for the bill approving the project before he left office, but it seems that was not fast enough. Both the new Attorney General and Governor of Michigan made their opposition to the Line 5 replacement project part of their election campaign last year. Governor Whitmer even called for the decommissioning of the existing pipeline on the campaign trail.Environmental concern about the area seems to be legitimate: a  report from a joint U.S.-Canadian advisory organization, the Science Advisory Board, suggested the Straits of Macinac is among more than a dozen locations in the region of the Great Lakes that are vulnerable to oil spills. However, proponents of the replacement project note that a new pipeline would be safer than the 65-old one. Line 5 carries crude oil and natural gas from Ontario to Wisconsin.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Sources: Saudis Admit They Want $70 OilTrump Boosts U.S. Presence In Taiwan StraitWorld’s 2nd Largest Oil Company Sees Huge Drop In Profit

Carlyle Group secured a 50-year lease on a land plot near Corpus Christi on the Texas coast in another step ahead on its US$1-billion oil export terminal project.The plot, Reuters reports, spans 200 acres and will be the site of the terminal and docks that will help take the increasing amounts of U.S. crude to international markets.The port authority of Corpus Christi meanwhile authorized the deepwater project, and dredging works that will make the future terminal accessible for larger tankers will begin this week.



The Carlyle project is one of eight planned for the U.S. Gulf Coast and the second at the Corpus Christi port. The private equity firm will invest US$400 million in the dredging works even though it has not yet made a final investment decision on the project.The export terminal and storage space enthusiasm is certainly understandable. However, it seems that not all eight projects will see the light of day.Reuters reported earlier this week shale oil and gas producers have started to reduce their capital spending plans under pressure for higher returns from investors. As a result, the flows of oil expected to the Gulf Coast might turn out to be lower than initially expected.



Some companies are already shelving projects or exiting them. Magellan Midstream Partners is one example: after on Monday the company announced a US$450 million downward revision to its capex outlook for the next two years, it said it will not proceed with a planned pipeline from the Permian to the Gulf Coast.The pipeline would have added 1 million bpd of capacity to the existing network but, according to the company, by the time it begins operating in mid-2020 this additional capacity would not be needed as other pipelines will be completed earlier than that and producers will be producing less than previously estimated.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:New Middle East Alliance Shakes World PowersThe One Thing That Could Derail The U.S. Oil BoomRussia Balks At Continued Oil Production Cut Alliance with OPEC

Venezuela has banned opposition leader Juan Guaido from holding public officer for a period of 15 years, according to Reuters, citing state comptroller Elvis Amoroso.Amoroso said the move was made after irregular financial disclosures and alleged spending that did not match his income. The investigation began sometime in February, just days after he declared himself interim president of the Latin American nation. Guaido has already been subject to a travel ban and frozen bank accounts pending Venezuela’s Supreme Court investigation that it undertook in January into “serious crimes violating constitutional order”.



Inside Venezuela Guaido has a tough road to hold, but outside of Venezuela, Guaido has found the favor of the United States and much of the rest of the world, a favor that calls into question just how long Maduro will be able to hold onto power.Speaking of power, that’s something that Venezuela is finding itself short on in recent weeks, as it suffered two major blackouts that halted oil production and oil exports from a country that holds the largest oil reserves in the world.



On Wednesday, Guaido announced that a mass mobilization plan was underway called “Operation Freedom”, a plan that was designed to force Maduro to step down. Guaido called on the masses to take to the streets to protest the recent power outages that the Maduro regime claims is an act of sabotage by the United States.Oil production and exports have declined steadily over the last few years, and there seems to be no end in sight to this freefall. Venezuela shuttered its largest oil-exporting terminal on Sunday due to the blackouts, restricting its oil exports even further. The port is essential for Venezuela as it must continue to ship oil to China and Russia to repay sizable loans.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:The World’s Largest Oil Company And Petrochemical Company MergeCan Energy Bring Peace To The Levant Basin?Oil Prices Fall As Trump Targets OPEC On Twitter

Libya’s oil revenues fell in February to $1.26 billion, according to its National Oil Company, as repeated oilfield closures continue to weigh on the troubled African nation.The oil revenues were $330 million less than January levels, while overall oil production had actually increased by 23,000 bpd in February, according to OPEC’s March Monthly Oil Market Report. Oil production in Libya fell in January to 883,000 bpd from 949,000 bpd in December 2018, rising to 906,000 bpd in February. Libya’s oil production averaged 811,000 bpd in 2017 and 952,000 bpd in 2018. March production is expected to be lifted further.



Libya continues to suffer from oilfield and port closures both due to inclimate weather and internal strife over who will control its great oil wealth that resulted in a force majeure over the last few months.Chairman of Libya’s NOC, Mustafa Sanalla, last month reiterated its plans to boost production to 2.1 million bpd by 2021 if—and that’s a pretty big if—it is able to improve its security situation.



To this end, BP said last October that it and Eni would be returning to Libya for a bit of risky business with exploratory drilling sometime during Q1 2019. Sanalla confirmed that BP was still interested in exploring oil in western Libya near its border with Algeria, and stressed that there were no security concerns in this area. Other foreign oil companies that may disregard the substantial security risks include Total SA, Repsol SA, and OMV AG, Sanalla told Bloomberg a couple weeks ago.Libya’s NOC is currently developing a new security plan to safeguard production from its prolific Sharara oilfield that has been plagued with unrest for years. Its output should be more than 300,000 bpd.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:The One Thing That Could Derail The U.S. Oil BoomOil Prices Fall As Trump Targets OPEC On TwitterThe World’s Largest Oil Company And Petrochemical Company Merge

South Africa is negotiating an oil deal with South Sudan, Energy Minister Jeff Radebe told media following reports that South Africa was in talks to build a US$1-billion refinery in Africa’s newest country.Radebe said the negotiations with South Sudan were not exclusive: Cape Town was seeking to reduce its exposure to the highly volatile oil prices by securing deals in the sector with other countries including Nigeria and Equatorial Guinea as well.South Africa is currently almost completely reliant on imported crude oil, but French Total recently announced a discovery off its shore that could contain as much as 1 billion barrels in total resources.



“It is gas condensate and light oil. Mainly gas. There are four other prospects on the license that we have to drill; it could be around 1 billion barrels of total resources of gas and condensate,” Total’s CEO Patrick Pouyanne said at the time.At the same time, South Sudan, which is home to most oil reserves of the old united country, is eager to start raising its oil production after a devastating civil war that has yet not ended completely.Before the civil war began, South Sudan produced 350,000 bpd of crude, but now production averaged 180,000 bpd. Plans are to boost this to 270,000 bpd and eventually restore the pre-war production level. The country has oil reserves estimated by BP at 3.5 billion barrels as of 2016. 



Reports of a US$1-billion refinery deal with South Africa first emerged earlier this year, saying Cape Town had already spent almost US$1.4 million (20 million rand) on the refinery project.  Radebe and the government were criticized by lawmakers of going about the deal in a secretive way. The Energy Minister dismissed the criticism saying all was “above board” in South Africa’s oil and gas negotiations with South Sudan.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:China’s Mad Scramble To Boost Domestic Oil ProductionSources: Saudis Admit They Want $70 OilTrump’s Last Chance To Subdue Gasoline Prices

At least five indigenous groups are looking to buy a stake in the Trans Mountain pipeline that the Canadian federal government bought from operator Kinder Morgan last year, CBC reports, adding that one of these groups yesterday met with finance minister Bill Morneau for early discussions of the issue.Participants in the discussion from the First Nations group said the talks were preliminary and not an acquisition discussion. The federal government has already stated it would rather sell the project once the expanded pipeline is built.""Any group that is interested in the Trans Mountain pipeline can be doing whatever they see fit from their perspective,"" Morneau told CBC, adding ""The government has not yet gotten to a decision point.""



In January, media reported that a group of First Nations was mulling over a bid for the project and would likely place it in April or May, the Vancouver Sun reported citing one representative of the group.There were even reports that the First Nations were discussing buying 100 percent of the pipeline.""We all want a safe and proper environment; the environment is so key,"" the chief executive of the Indian Resource Council said at the time. “""But we can continue to still do some economic development and have that balance. And that's what we need to strive for — to find that balance.""



The federal government of Canada last year bought the Trans Mountain expansion project from TransCanada for US$3.4 billion (C$4.5 billion) when the latter said it was reluctant to pursue the project in the face of too many delays and strong opposition from environmentalists and the new government of British Columbia. It then said it would seek other buyers for the project to carry it out. The expansion project will cost more than US$5 billion (C$7 billion).The Trans Mountain project is currently suspended while the British Columbia Court of Appeals hears a case brought against it by the government of the province and a First Nation that is against the project.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Oil Is Set To Rise, But The Rally May Not LastA Paradigm Shift In The PermianWhat’s Keeping Oil From Rallying To $75?

Sempra Energy has ambitions to become the top U.S. liquefied natural gas producer, the company’s chief executive told Reuters.Sempra has five LNG projects under development right now, in Louisiana, Texas, and Mexico, that together will have the capacity to produce 45 million tons of LNG. That’s more than what Cheniere Energy, the current leader in this space, plans to have in terms of capacity at its two LNG plants in Sabine Pass and Corpus Christi.Eventually, Sempra could become the second-largest LNG supplier in the United States if and when Cheniere builds its small-scale LNG trains now at the planning stage.



“We are going to move aggressively to unlock these five projects over the next three to five years,” CEO Jeff Martin told Reuters, noting the expected jump in LNG demand resulting from a large-scale shift from coal to cleaner fossil fuels.U.S. LNG capacity could reach a daily processing rate of 8.8 billion cu ft this year and rise further to 10.1 billion cu ft daily in 2020, from 3.8 billion cu ft daily in 2018. However, all this is contingent on the companies behind the projects securing long-term contracts with buyers.Related: Sources: Saudis Admit They Want $70 Oil



For now, this is challenging because of the price situation: LNG prices have fallen substantially over the past 12 months after a surge in new supply with two large-scale projects in Australia starting production last year. As a result, buyers are preferring to buy their LNG on spot markets rather than opt for long-term contracts that could end up being costlier.LNG projects cost billions of dollars to build and are often accompanied by cost overruns and delays. Companies with activities in the area need debt financing to go ahead with their plans, and lenders are a lot more willing to dispense the cash when they see long-term commitments from buyers.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Oil Is Set To Rise, But The Rally May Not LastA Paradigm Shift In The PermianWhat’s Keeping Oil From Rallying To $75?

The Japanese parliament approved an extension of insurance coverage for imports of Iranian crude oil effective from the start of April and expiring a year later. However, this does not mean Japanese refiners will continue buying Iranian crude if they do not score sanction waivers from Washington.Reuters reports Japan’s parliament approved the import insurance extension yesterday. Now, refiners are pressing the government to find a way to secure an extension to the waiver that Washington granted Tokyo and seven other importers in November.Despite the sanction waiver, Japan only restarted its purchases of Iranian crude last month, at a rate of just a little above 76,000 bpd, compared to almost 160,000 bpd a year earlier. S&P Global Platts reports this was the first time Japanese refiners took in Iranian crude in four months as they treaded with extra caution around Washington, which still aims to reduce Iranian oil exports to zero.



According to shipping data from S&P Global Platts, the last Japan-bound cargo of Iranian crude left earlier this month and should reach Japan by mid-April. The sanction waiver that the U.S. granted Japan and seven other importers expires on May 4.The chances for an extension seem slim right now. Washington’s special envoy for Iran, Brian Hook, earlier this week told VOA no new waivers will be granted after the expiry of the current ones.Related: Texas Needs 11,000 More Miles Of Pipelines



“The policy of the United States is that we are not looking to grant any new oil waivers,” Hook said. “We did have to grant eight oil waivers in order to avoid shocking the global oil markets and causing a dramatic increase in the price of oil. We have taken off roughly 1½ million barrels of Iranian crude, and we have avoided a price increase in oil.”“And that’s not an accident. We’ve done it very well and very carefully. 2019 is going to be a much better market for global oil supply, and the forecasters say that there will be more supply than demand. That gives us much better market conditions to accelerate our path to zero imports,” the official added.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Sources: Saudis Admit They Want $70 OilTrump Boosts U.S. Presence In Taiwan StraitWorld’s 2nd Largest Oil Company Sees Huge Drop In Profit

Idaho Power, the state utility, plans to retire all its coal power plants and generate all of its electricity from renewable sources by 2045, NPR reports, citing an announcement by Idaho Power.Idaho Power already gets almost 50 percent of the power it generates from hydropower and will also pursue solar and wind power to replace coal in its clean energy drive.For starters, the utility plans to retire two coal power plants by 2025 and eventually shut down the third and last one. Also, Idaho Power has sealed a deal to buy electricity that will be produced at a 120 MW solar farm that is yet to be built in the state.



With these plans, Idaho is joining other utilities in a renewable energy drive that seeks to reduce dependence on fossil fuels amid growing opposition spurred on by climate change reports.These efforts are already paying off: earlier this month the EIA reported electricity produced from renewable sources reached a record of 742 million MWh last year, an almost double increase over ten years. As portion of the total energy mix, renewables accounted for 17.6 percent.What’s more, most of this increase came from solar and wind: a 90-percent increase between 2008 and 2018. Wind power generation jumped the most, from 55 million MWh in 2008 to 275 million MWh in 2018. it was only exceeded by hydropower, which totaled 292 million MWh in 2018.



The Idaho utility did not mention what it planned to do with its three gas-fired power plants. Nuclear energy could also find a place in the new energy mix of the state. There are plans in place to test a new sort of modular nuclear reactor in Idaho. The modular reactors each have a generation capacity of 50 MW.""We'll be evaluating all kinds of new, existing and emerging technologies to help us reach our goal,” Idaho Power said earlier this month in response to a question about whether nuclear will be included in its cleaner energy mix. ""That includes looking into nuclear technology, such as the small modular reactors planned in eastern Idaho.""By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:China’s Mad Scramble To Boost Domestic Oil ProductionSources: Saudis Admit They Want $70 OilTrump’s Last Chance To Subdue Gasoline Prices

Enbridge’s much-debated Line 3 oil pipeline replacement chalked up one in the win column on Wednesday, according to Reuters who cited company statements.The Line 3 pipeline plan garnered approval yet again from the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission to replace in total over a thousand miles of pipeline.The approval for Line 3’s replacement actually came last year, but petitions were later raised by those opposing the project, asking for the commission to reconsider its approval. It dispensed with the petitions in December, but Minnesota’s governor challenged that ruling last month, the latest in a long string of setbacks for the pipeline project.



Today, Minnesota confirmed its earlier decision, denying all requests for reconsideration.The pipeline, which will help bring Canadian oil to US markets, is not only a win for Enbridge, but a win for Canada’s oil industry, which has suffered from a serious shortage of takeaway capacity that ate away at the price of its oil and created a huge discount to WTI.Despite the win, the project is not expected to begin carrying oil until at least H2 2020. Enbridge had originally planned to have the pipeline completely replaced by the end of 2019, but announced earlier this month that it would delay the completion by six months after hearing from the state of Minnesota that the timeline for collecting permits would take longer than originally thought.



Line 3 is expected to have a capacity of 370,000 bpd—not enough to completely eliminate Canadian bottlenecks, but enough to relieve much of the pressure on Canada’s oil industry.The Line 3 replacement is one of two major pipeline projects that Canada’s oil industry desperately needs. Earlier this week, reports emerged that the unknowns in Canada’s oil industry has cut into long-term crude oil contracts as traders took a wait-and-see attitude before diving in.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Oil Falls After EIA Reports Crude BuildVenezuela’s Oil Production In Jeopardy After New BlackoutTrump Weighs In On Controversial Occupied Territory

In the crowded U.S. LNG space, Tellurian Inc says it will likely make a final investment decision on its $30-billion Louisiana Driftwood export project during the first half of this year, alluding to a handful of customers for its planned first phase.If the FID comes through as planned, the first LNG could come out of this project by 2023, with full completion by 2026, Reuters cited Tellurian CEO Meg Gentle as saying on the sidelines of the BloombergNEF summit in New York.  The announcement follows Tellurian’s reported losses of nearly $126 million for 2018, on $10.8 million in revenue; nonetheless, that’s better than 2017 losses, which were nearly double.Tellurian’s Driftwood project, which would produce 27.6 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) of LNG when completed, is unique in that while is one of at least 12 such projects in the pipeline in the United States, it is going for something fully integrated. In other words, it’s planning to both build and own the export terminal, as well as produce its own gas, host its own pipelines, and sell its own LNG globally.



More than anything, Tellurian is eyeing the Chinese market.Gentle alluded to “positive” signs of forward movement between the United States and China over the past couple of months, and noted that China will be the largest LNG export market for the U.S.“They’re still growing at roughly 30 percent a year,” Gentle told Bloomberg in a video interview.“We are now developing stranded gas that doesn’t have a market and is stuck behind pipe in the U.S. And China is a huge market, so a conclusion to the trade deal will help that gas flow,” the Tellurian CEO added.



“Gas is going to go to China even if it ends up being on a short-term basis. So, it’s only a matter of whether there’s investment or long-term contracting […]. Otherwise, we’ll just leave it to the short-term market to sort it out.”In the meantime, there are rumors that Driftwood has been courting Qatar and Saudi Arabia. While Gentle did not confirm those rumors explicitly, she did hint at Middle East partners as well as Asian.“We are looking for partners, and actually I would say we are to the stage now that we are concluding documents with our partners.”By Damir Kaletovic for Oilprice.comMore Top Read From Oilprice.com:The World’s Largest Oil Company And Petrochemical Company MergeU.S. Squabbles Over New Iran Sanction WaiversVenezuela Main Oil Port Shuts Down Amid Blackout

As Canadian crude oil struggles with crippling rail bottlenecks, it is of minor comfort that Canada’s Imperial Oil has managed to re-start shipments from Alberta of a modest and undisclosed amount of crude this week.Yet, in a situation in which Canadian crude shipments by rail have halved since their record of just over 350,000 bpd in December, Imperial’s resumption of shipping at all is a hopeful sign.  In an email to Reuters, a spokesperson for Imperial said the company had resumed “a small amount of shipments that are economic under current conditions”.  Alberta’s crude glut led to a provincial government move in January to implement mandatory production cuts. Since then, the cost of shipping crude by rail has become uneconomical. Shipments of crude by rail have all but ended, and pipelines are at or near capacity.



For March, total volumes of crude-by-rail shipments were in the rage of 160,000-175,000 bpd, according to analysts at TPH Energy Research cited by Reuters. The overall data seems to show that rail shipments are slowly increasing, with Imperial appearing to provide further evidence. But it’s far from an end to Alberta’s oil glut, particularly when Imperial is not releasing any actual numbers of what they’ve finally managed to ship economically. For Imperial, the provincial government’s mandatory removal of 325,000 bpd from the market is cause for concern. Imperial is an integrated oil company, and this will affect profitability in its downstream segment. 



It also has meant that because of the gaping spread between Canadian crude and WTI, feedstock for Imperial’s refining operations is too expensive. In other words, there’s no margin in the end product. Imperial has three key assets in Alberta and is focused solely on oil sands, with the capacity to produce around 400,000 bpd, and plans to grow production by some 15 percent over the next couple of years, assuming government cuts and an ongoing rail bottleneck do not stand in the way too much longer.By Damir Kaletovic for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:China’s Mad Scramble To Boost Domestic Oil ProductionSources: Saudis Admit They Want $70 OilTrump’s Last Chance To Subdue Gasoline Prices

An oil terminal in tiny oil-rich Gabon has been shuttered following a union strike action on Tuesday, according to union statements carried by Reuters, in a move that may further sour foreign oil companies on its current offshore oil licensing round.The strike at VAALCO Energy’s terminal, which took offline 14,000 barrels per day, is expected to last five days, according to ONEP, the union responsible for organizing the workers’ strike. ONEP has organized other strikes in Gabon’s oil sector as recently as December, over six workers who were fired from French Total.This time around, the strike has been called over the issue of annual leave for its represented workers.



Gabon, which lies on the Atlantic Coast in Central Africa, though small, is a member of OPEC. Gabon first became a full member of the organization back in 1975, but terminated its membership in 1995. On July 1, 2016, Gabon re-joined the OPEC group of the oil exporting nations.Gabon’s oil production stands at 203,000 bpd as of OPEC’s latest Monthly Oil Market Report—a marked decline from the days of 300,000+ bpd decades ago. Still, Gabon is Africa’s fifth largest oil producer. Oil accounts for 80 percent of all Gabonese exports, 45 percent of Gabon’s GDP, and 60 percent of its fiscal revenue in recent years, according to the World Bank. It remains a vital component of Gabon’s economy.Gabon has substantial oil reserves, but efforts to attract foreign investments have been slow going, mired by regulatory uncertainties, stiff corporation taxes, and political instability, and it has moved its closing date twice for the current offshore licensing round, which is now set to end in September versus the original closing date of April.



A failed coup in January may have further spooked foreign oil companies that may otherwise be interested in its lucrative oil industry.ONEP said that today’s strike may be extended beyond the promised five days if its demands go unanswered.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Sources: Saudis Admit They Want $70 OilTrump Boosts U.S. Presence In Taiwan StraitWorld’s 2nd Largest Oil Company Sees Huge Drop In Profit

The U.S. Gulf Coast is set to become a net crude oil exporting region for the first time in a quarterly basis, signaling a shift in global oil flows that has been in the making for a while. This means the patterns of trade using Very Large Crude Carriers are also set for a change, Lloyds’ List reports.According to data from the shipping service, while there was one VLCC loading at a Gulf Coast port every six days in 2017, last year this rose to almost four VLCCs every six days. During the first 11 weeks of 2019, the total number of VLCCs loading at the Gulf Coast increased to 53, with the average daily amount of crude flowing out of the U.S. at 3.6 million barrels, according to EIA data.Most of this is going to Asia, with South Korea turning into the most active buyer of U.S. crude this year, surpassing China and Canada. Currently, according to Lloyd’s List, there are some 48.5 million barrels of U.S. crude traveling east on 23 VLCCs and three Suezmax tankers.



The Gulf Coast’s turning into a net exporter has prompted port expansion plans as currently there is only one port capable of handling the largest crude oil carries that can accommodate as much as 2 million barrels of the commodity. That’s the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port while others need to relay the load from smaller to larger tankers further out at sea as the waters around the ports are too shallow for them.Related: Sources: Saudis Admit They Want $70 OilOne expansion has already been completed, at the Ingleside terminal in Texas, which Occidental last year sold to a private equity-backed company. Now, the oil export terminal in Ingleside can handle VLCCs directly.



Another project—a larger one—is in the planning stage in Texas, too. Dubbed COLT, it will cost US$800 million and is currently awaiting regulatory approval. There are seven more export terminal expansion projects planned to handle the growing outflows of U.S. oil to the world.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Oil Falls After EIA Reports Crude BuildVenezuela’s Oil Production In Jeopardy After New BlackoutTrump Weighs In On Controversial Occupied Territory

A consortium is preparing to start building solar-powered car parks across Scotland as part of a trial project for so-called Smart Hubs that will feature both EV charging points and battery storage. The six trial sites will also include vehicle-to-grid facilities (V2G) so EVs can feed energy back into the grid when necessary.The Scotsman reports that the consortium behind the project involves several energy companies, among them Flexitricity, Turbo Power Systems, Flexisolar, and Smart Power Systems, which are hoping to have the pilot car parks ready later this year.The aim of the project, however, is not just a way of spurring greater EV adoption. The solar-powered car parks will also alleviate the potential pressure of EV charging on the grid, which, the daily notes, is already strained. If successful, the project will be expanded into other parts of the UK.



The UK has pledged to phase out gasoline and diesel cars by 2040, but the Scottish government is even more ambitious: it eyes 2032 as the year when there will be only EVs on its roads. The goal is truly ambitious, especially in light of estimates that say by 2030 there will be some nine million EVs on UK roads.While that’s not enough to replace the current ICE fleet, it is a substantial number, and having solar-powered charging sites would help the grid cope with the increased demand.“Electric cars and buses are going to be the principal method of transport in just a few years. However, we know that the current grid system will only be able to cope if smart charging and grid management are adopted across the network,” said a senior executive at one of the companies in the consortium behind the project, Flextricity.



“We now need to invest in smart technologies and change the way we operate power grids if we want to make the growth of electric vehicles a positive story for the UK. I believe smart vehicle charging will be the difference between the success and failure in reaching our electric vehicle ambitions,” Alastair Martin added.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Is The Nuclear Industry Abusing Subsidies?Venezuela’s Oil Production In Jeopardy After New BlackoutHedge Funds Are Buying Oil Again

A commission has been convened in Nigeria’s Bayelsa state to look into oil spills in the Niger Delta to try and hold oil companies more accountable, CNN reports, quoting the official who initiated the move.""This Commission will investigate the human and environmental impact of multinational oil company activity and is crucial to the prosperous future of the people of Bayelsa and their environment, Nigeria and hopefully to other oil-producing nations,"" the Archbishop of York, John Sentamu said.



The panel was convened by the governor of the Bayelsa state, who said in a statement ""The world has looked on for too long without taking the necessary collective action to put a stop to the damage being done by oil companies in Bayelsa. We must put the environment and the health and wellbeing of our communities first.""There were more than 12,000 spills in the Niger Delta between 1976 and 2014. More than half of these were caused by pipeline corrosion and tanker accidents. The rest were a result of mechanical error and sabotage, the Journal of Health and Pollution reported last year.



Oil companies have blamed most spills and pipeline leaks on sabotage and vandalism: cutting into pipelines to siphon fuel is not an uncommon practice in the Delta. It has in fact fueled a whole illicit refining industry in the region that the government has tried tackling in various ways, from violent shutdowns to, most recently, negotiations to make the illegal refineries come out from the shadow economy.The tension between Niger Delta communities and the federal government, however, are not over. The communities are demanding more revenues from the oil industry to be directed towards improving their living conditions and creating jobs in the Delta: the two factors that led to the rise of militant groups that caused quite a lot of headaches for field and pipeline operators in the region in the last few years.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Oil Falls After EIA Reports Crude BuildWhat Is Pushing China Back To Coal?Venezuela’s Oil Production In Jeopardy After New Blackout

Investments in the production of lower-sulfur fuels at refineries across the world have reached US$1 billion to date, a BP executive said at an industry forum in the UAE.“There’s been a huge amount of investment in refineries since 2015 and (it) will continue beyond 2020,” Eddie Gauci, BP’s global head of marine fuels, said as quoted by Reuters at the Fujairah Bunkering and Fuel Oil Forum.Refiners have been preparing for the entry into effect of a sulfur emission cap drafted by the International Maritime Organisation. The cap is 0.5 percent, down from 3.5 percent, and it enters into effect in January 2020.



The new rule has sparked a lot of speculation about where oil markets will swing in the coming months and years, with warnings about a possible shortage of middle distillates and an oversupply of light crude. What seems certain enough is there will be a lot of fuels in storage ahead of the entry into effect of the new rule.“We will see some floating storage of high sulfur or low sulfur for a period of time until the land-based infrastructure establishes some kind of equilibrium that’s in tune with what grades of fuel are called for in particular locations,” BP’s Gauci said.Earlier this month the International Energy Agency said in its annual Oil 2019 report, “The 2020 IMO marine regulation change is one of the most dramatic ever seen to product specifications, although the shipping and refining industries have had several years notice.”



So refiners are investing in preparatory activities, be it by adjusting their equipment to produce lower-sulfur fuels or, most immediately, in changing refinery maintenance schedules to capture the higher profit margins of middle distillates such as diesel and marine gasoil, which have a lower sulfur content, with an anticipated spike in demand later this year.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Oil Falls After EIA Reports Crude BuildVenezuela’s Oil Production In Jeopardy After New BlackoutChina Can’t Get Enough Of This Discounted Oil

The American Petroleum Institute (API) reported a build in crude oil inventory 1.93 million barrels for the week ending March 22, coming in under analyst expectations of a 1.1-million-barrel draw.Last week, the API reported a large surprise draw in crude oil of 2.133 million barrels. A day later, the EIA reported a draw of a much larger amount, estimating that crude inventories had drawn down by 9.6 million barrels. Including this week’s data, the net build of just 430,000 barrels for the twelve reporting periods so far this year, using API data.


WTI was trading up on Tuesday in the runup to the data release at $59.94, up $1.12 (+1.90%) on the day at 1:25pm. The Brent benchmark was trading up at $67.43, up $0.62 (+0.93%) at that time. While the WTI benchmark is trading up roughly $.70 week on week the Brent benchmark is trading down $.15 per barrel.Oil prices are still near four-month highs, with WTI even breaking the $60 mark earlier on Tuesday, as Saudi Arabia reaffirms its commitment to hold fast to its production cuts and hints that it is looking for at least $70 oil. Still, economic worries that threaten future oil demand serve as the current barrier for further price gains.Related: Trump’s Last Chance To Subdue Gasoline PricesThe API this week reported a draw in gasoline inventories for week ending March 22 in the amount of 3.469 million barrels. Analysts estimated a draw in gasoline inventories of 2.900 million barrels for the week.US crude oil production as estimated by the Energy Information Administration showed that production for the week ending March 15—the latest information available—resumed its 12.1 million bpd average—an all-time high for the United States.



Distillate inventories decreased by 4.278 million barrels, compared to an expected draw of 716,000 barrels for the week.Crude oil inventories at the Cushing, Oklahoma facility grew by 688,000 barrels for the week.The U.S. Energy Information Administration report on crude oil inventories is due to be released on Wednesday at 10:30a.m. EST.By 4:39pm EST, WTI was trading up at $60.04 and Brent was trading up at $67.52.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads from Oilprice.com:Sources: Saudis Admit They Want $70 OilSchlumberger Won’t Take New Full-Oilfield Management ProjectsMexico Scrambles To Save Its Sinking Oil Company

Saudi Arabia, through its oil behemoth Saudi Aramco, is looking to decreasing its carbon footprint by creating a global gas business, Aramco’s CEO Amin Nasser said during an industry event in China on Tuesday.The move is part of company’s strategy to boost efforts to grow its natural gas output, from both conventional and unconventional reserves. Saudi Aramco is already a top global oil producer but still lagging behind in gas production.The oil giant is expanding its gas sector under an ambitious $150 billion investment plan over the next 10 years that will see production rise to 23 Bcf/d from its current 14 Bcf/d. Saudi Arabia aims to export as much as 3 billion cubic feet of gas per day by 2030.Eventually, Aramco aims to use gas for 70% of its power generation. Any surplus gas would be exported, and China’s market is robust. Saudi Aramco said recently its natural gas reserves stood at 319.5 Tcf as of the end of 2017, up from a previously reported 302.3 Tcf.



As for China, Aramco is a major investor energy sector there and as of last month, was its biggest crude oil supplier, topping Russia.In February, Saudi Aramco announced a joint venture with Chinese companies NORINCOP Group and Panjin Sincen, to develop a $10 billion refining/petrochemical complex in northeast China’s Liaoning Province.Related: Texas Needs 11,000 More Miles Of PipelinesThe joint venture, agreed during Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman's two-day trip to China last month, is expected to be put into operation in 2024, and will promote the development of a fully integrated refining and petrochemical complex in Panjin.With the capacity to refine 15 million tons of oil and produce 1.5 million tons of ethylene and 1.3 million tons of paraxylene a year, the annual sales revenue of the company is expected to exceed $14 billion.



According to the agreement, Saudi Aramco holds 35 percent of the joint venture, Norinco and Panjin Xincheng hold 36 percent and 29 percent respectively.Also, Saudi Aramco also has considered making investments in liquefied natural gas projects in the Russian Arctic and the United States. According to some news report, the company is also eyeing investment in Australia, as of recently the world’s top exporter of LNG.By Damir Kaletovic for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:What’s Keeping Oil From Rallying To $75?Oil Markets Ignore Warning Signs Of Looming RecessionRussian Troops Land In Oil-Rich Venezuela

Norway’s state oil and gas major Equinor plans to join a battery technology investment fund worth US$180 million as part of a diversification strategy focused on renewable energy and storage, Fortune reports.Energy storage is drawing increasing attention in the industry as it is widely considered the factor that could guarantee the mainstream future of wind and solar power generation facilities, solving what is perhaps their biggest problem: intermittence.The fund Equinor has chosen for its investment, Volta Energy Technologies, has a marked focus on energy storage, investing in various technology businesses related to this segment in the industry.



Equinor, which used to be called Statoil, last year announced a rebranding program that centered on a change of name to reflect its ambitions to be perceived as a broader energy company rather than one focused solely on oil and gas. The rebranding was also part of its diversification drive.Energy storage is a natural focus of attention for energy companies as are renewables, since they are in the same industry. Equinor has been particularly active in wind power, with stakes in four offshore projects in the UK, one in Germany, and a large-scale offshore project in the United States. It also has a participation in a solar power project in Brazil and has invested in two companies developing solar power technology.Earlier today, media reported that the Norwegian company had also taken part in a funding round for a smart grid developer, Reactive Technologies. The round, according to the UK and Finland-based company, raised an eight-digit sum.



Equinor’s push into business areas different from its core oil and gas business reflects a government-level push for more renewables. Earlier this month, the Norwegian government approved a proposal by the country’s sovereign wealth fund to divest from pure-play oil and gas producers to reduce its exposure to oil and gas price volatility.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:What’s Keeping Oil From Rallying To $75?Oil Markets Ignore Warning Signs Of Looming RecessionRussian Troops Land In Oil-Rich Venezuela

The government of British Columbia has proposed tax incentives for energy companies with ambitions in the LNG segment, CBC reports, citing Finance Minister Carole James, who claims that such incentives would create thousands of jobs.""British Columbians are counting on us to attract LNG investment that meets strict conditions: delivering jobs and financial benefits to B.C., creating economic partnerships with Indigenous peoples and protecting our clean air, land and water,"" the minister said.The proposal was announced soon after the British Columbian government praised the final investment decision on the US$31-billion LNG Canada project, which was announced last October, after months of uncertainty.



LNG Canada will be the first liquefied natural gas production and export facility in the country, and according to federal PM Justin Trudeau, it “is the single largest private sector investment project in Canadian history.”LNG Canada is a project of Shell, with a 40-percent stake, Malaysia’s Petronas with 25 percent, PetroChina with 15 percent, Mitsubishi with 15 percent, and South Korea’s Kogas with 5 percent.Given the size of the investment and the potential job creation, it would make sense for the NDP government to seek to attract more energy projects in this segment while it continues to staunchly oppose the expansion of the Trans Mountain oil pipeline. However, there is opposition against LNG Canada as well.



Most recently, LNG Canada made headlines when work on the GasLink pipeline that would feed natural gas to the B.C. coast liquefaction facility was halted after a couple of indigenous artifacts were found at the construction site.The artifacts, according to the B.C. energy regulator, did not originate in the place where they were found. Some read this as the regulator insinuating that they were put there to stop work on the pipeline, which some First Nations are protesting against passing through their territory.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Oil Is Set To Rise, But The Rally May Not LastA Paradigm Shift In The PermianWhat’s Keeping Oil From Rallying To $75?

The unrelenting unrest in Algeria in the form of mass protests seeking to force President Abdelaziz Bouteflika out of office has investors worried; but so far, there are no signs that oil and gas output has been affected. On Tuesday, the International Energy Agency (IEA) told Reuters that Algerian production and exports had not been affected, but the agency continued to monitor the situation for new developments.Cause for concern has increased since ExxonMobil moved to halt talks over Algerian shale assets last week over the protests and what Exxon clearly views as dangerous instability. Protests began in mid-February with Bouteflika’s attempt to run for a fifth term as president. 



Those same protests succeeded in forcing Bouteflika to publicly announce he would not be running for a fifth term; however, protests have not ceased and show no signs of letting up until the president steps down. What Exxon is eyeing is a situation in which Bouteflika is forced to resign and what ensues in a political vacuum that leads to further unrest for the major oil producer. Investors are now closely watching what the military’s next move will be, with news emerging today that the military chief of staff has publicly taken sides with the protesters. Other political elite have also appeared to abandon Bouteflika, including some ruling party members and key business leaders. 



In the meantime, Algeria’s state-run oil company, Sonatrach, has priced its April-loading cargoes of Saharan blend at flat to Dated Brent, Reuters reports, compared to 30 cents above Brent for March cargoes. This will hit at the heart of the issue, which is that Bouteflika needs high oil prices to keep subsidizing his autocratic rule, and he’s not getting them. “The debate is now focused on politics, but the real iceberg is the risk of an economic crisis in the next couple of years and no one has a strategy to tackle this,” Riccardo Fabiani, Algeria analyst at Energy Aspects, a London-based consultancy, told the Financial Times. “Foreign reserves are falling very quickly and they probably have less than two years of import cover left.”By Damir Kaletovic for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Sources: Saudis Admit They Want $70 OilTexas Needs 11,000 More Miles Of PipelinesMexico Scrambles To Save Its Sinking Oil Company

Carbon emissions reached 33.1 gigatons last year, breaking their previous record even though the annual increase was relatively modest, at 1.7 percent, the International Energy Agency said in its new Global Energy & CO2 Status Report.The disheartening increase that came amid an even stronger push towards a shift from fossil fuels to renewables came on the back of new addition to the coal plant capacity of developing countries in Asia. This growth resulted in coal accounting for 30 percent of all energy-related CO2 emissions last year. What’s more, the new coal power plant additions in Asia more than offset plant closures in other parts of the world.



Despite the somewhat depressing data, which should not have come as a surprise in any case, there was some good news as well. Energy demand rose by 2.3 percent last year, which was almost double the average annual growth rate for the period since 2010, the IEA, noted, but most of that higher demand was satisfied with energy sources cleaner than coal and oil.Gas was the fastest-growing growing energy source in 2018, accounting for almost 45 percent of the increased energy demand. Oil demand also increased, but not so impressively. Together, fossil fuels covered some 70 percent of the higher energy demand.



Meanwhile, renewables adoption grew by a double-digit rate, which was certainly encouraging. Unfortunately, this rate of growth in new renewable installations could not keep up with the pace of rising energy demand. Still, solar, wind, and other renewable energy sources covered 25 percent of primary energy demand last year. This was thanks to more renewable power generation additions: in power generation, renewables accounted for 45 percent of demand growth in 2018.The IEA noted that electricity is turning into “the fuel of the future”, which will likely drive further renewable energy adoption in the years to come. Still, demand for fossil fuels will remain, with gas leading the way as the cleanest of the fossil fuels.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Oil Is Set To Rise, But The Rally May Not LastTesla Lagging Behind Competitors In European EV MarketsMexico Scrambles To Save Its Sinking Oil Company

Oil workers at Sharara, the largest field in Libya which has recently re-opened after a three-month hiatus, have demanded a salary increase of 67 percent as they try to return oil production at the site to its normal 315,000-bpd production rate, Reuters reported on Monday, citing a video that the workers have posted.The government decided to raise the salaries by 67 percent back in 2013, but the raise never materialized, while Sharara continues to suffer from frequent closures due to armed groups occupying it.According to Reuters, workers at two other oil fields in Libya are also demanding a salary increase by two thirds.



Libya’s internationally recognized National Oil Corporation (NOC) supports the salary hike demands, saying that oil workers continue to work under extremely difficult circumstances, adding that it was disappointing that a salary increase has not been included in Libyan government’s budget for this year.In early March, the Sharara oil field returned to operations after being closed for production in December, when clashes between militant groups forced NOC to institute a force majeure.Sharara has been one of the main reasons the North African country is widely seen as a wild card in global oil price forecasts. Since it accounts for around a third of the country’s total oil output, Sharara, like the export terminals in the Oil Crescent, has become a natural target for various groups vying for power and control over Libya’s oil wealth.



As of last week, Libya’s oil production was 1.2 million bpd according to Tripoli-based finance minister Faraj Bomtar, and a further increase is expected in the coming days. Sharara was said to be pumping 270,000 bpd as of March 19.While rising production at Sharara could boost Libyan oil production and revenues, security issues and frequent outages at the field and at other Libyan facilities and ports make market observers and OPEC cautious about predicting supply from the country.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:What’s Keeping Oil From Rallying To $75?Oil Markets Ignore Warning Signs Of Looming RecessionRussian Troops Land In Oil-Rich Venezuela

The fire at a petrochemical storage site at Deer Park, Texas, which blazed for days and halted some ship traffic at the Houston port, has intensified calls for increased scrutiny of oil and fuel storage facilities, potentially requiring tougher regulations for many proposed oil storage terminals along the U.S. Gulf Coast.A fire at the Intercontinental Terminals Company (ITC) that started on Sunday, March 17, continued until Wednesday and prompted many state agencies to start looking into the reasons of the incident. Residents of Deer Park and Galena Park were told twice last week to stay indoors, and schools canceled classes for several days.Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton filed on Friday an environmental lawsuit against ITC seeking injunctive relief and civil penalties in connection with the fire at the petrochemical site.



“The state of Texas works hard to maintain good air quality and will hold ITC accountable for the damage it has done to our environment,” Attorney General Paxton said. “ITC has a history of environmental violations, and this latest incident is especially disturbing and frightening. No company can be allowed to disrupt lives and put public health and safety at risk,” he added.The federal Chemical Safety Board said last week that it would investigate the fire, which engulfed 11 above-ground storage tanks.Investigations and reviews of the investigations could result in proposals for increased environmental scrutiny for many future storage facilities that are planned to accommodate the growing U.S. oil production for exports.



Harris County in Texas, the site of the ITC fire, plans to review the investigations and could propose amendments to state regulations, Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo told Reuters. “State lawmakers have a role here, too. They can make risk management plans readily available so emergency responders and the public have specific information on potential hazards at chemical facilities. Right now, they are difficult to obtain in the state of Texas,” Elena Craft, senior director for health and climate at Environmental Defense Fund, wrote in an op-ed in Houston Chronicle last week.“They can close the loophole that allows industry to avoid penalties for unauthorized pollution releases,” Craft said.

Global demand for high-sulfur fuel oil is expected to drop by 25 percent through 2025 because of the stricter emissions regulations for ship fuel beginning in 2020, Reuters quoted Bryan Milton, President of ExxonMobil Fuels and Lubricants, as saying at the Scotia Howard Weil 47th Annual Energy Conference in New Orleans on Monday.The new sulfur content regulations by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) as of January 1, 2020, limit the sulfur content in fuels for ships to 0.5 percent, slashed from the current 3.5-percent limit.The downstream sector globally is on the cusp of “one of the biggest shakeups ever,” the IEA said in its Oil 2019 annual report earlier this month, referring to the IMO rules as of next year.



The IEA estimates in the annual report that demand for high sulfur fuel oil (HSFO), the main vessel fuel since the 1960s, will plunge to 1.4 million bpd from 3.5 million bpd in just one year, and that there will be 4,000 scrubbers installed on large vessels by the end of 2020, consuming 700,000 bpd of fuel oil.At the same time, many shipping companies will prefer to use marine gasoil (MGO) instead of a new very low sulfur fuel oil (VLSFO), despite its higher price, the IEA notes, estimating that demand for MGO will jump from 890,000 bpd in 2019 to 1.98 million bpd in 2020. The drop in fuel oil demand and the rise of petrochemicals over the next few years will benefit the U.S. oil producers whose typical crude products are lighter, the IEA said.



Meanwhile, oil refiners around the world from Europe to the United States to Asia are preparing to capture high refinery margins for distillates like diesel and marine gasoil—as high as they can get.To this end, some refiners have changed their maintenance schedules for 2019, with planned refinery stoppages heavily geared toward the spring in the first half of the year, leaving more operating refining capacity for the fall of 2019, when the 2020 ship fuel change will be imminent.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Schlumberger Won’t Take New Full-Oilfield Management ProjectsWhat Norway’s Decision To Divest Means For US ShaleWorld’s 2nd Largest Oil Company Sees Huge Drop In Profit

Sour medium oil from Shell’s and BP’s Gulf of Mexico platforms is replacing Venezuela’s heavy oil for many U.S. refiners who are on the lookout for alternatives sources of crude after the U.S. sanctions on the Venezuelan oil industry, Reuters reported on Monday, citing trade sources and data.The two supermajors BP and Shell are also major operators and producers in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, and their crude is being purchased by U.S. refiners, with the medium sour Mars grade from the Mars platform operated by Shell with partner BP a favorite.Prices of Mars have increased after the U.S. imposed sanctions on Venezuela, boosted by tighter medium-heavy supplies, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said in its Oil Market Report for March.Mars crude prices have jumped to the highest in five years, Reuters reported on Monday, citing data it has reviewed, company executives, and market participants.



The largest U.S. refiner Marathon Petroleum Corp has been buying more Mars for the time being, CEO Gary Heminger told Reuters.Earlier this month, Heminger said that the U.S. sanctions on Venezuela’s oil industry had not had a significant impact on the company’s operations, as Venezuelan crude oil was a small percentage of the millions of barrels of oil the refiner buys every day.Most of the U.S. refiners have been reducing purchases of Venezuelan oil for some time, Heminger said earlier this month.Marathon Petroleum and Valero Energy have been buying Mars from Shell’s trading unit after the sanctions were imposed, while Phillips 66 has been buying the Southern Green Canyon grade from Shell, according to sources familiar with the trades who spoke to Reuters.



Shell and BP representatives refrained from linking higher interest for medium sour Gulf of Mexico crudes to the U.S. sanctions on Venezuela, but told Reuters there has been market interest.Gulf of Mexico production hit a record 1.679 million bpd in 2018, according to EIA data. Output is expected to further increase in 2019 as new fields are expected to come on stream.

The governor of Khuzestan, the biggest oil-rich province in Iran, has banned government officials from leaving it despite the danger of floods in the region, Radio Farda reports, citing a statement by Gholamreza Shariati.""Since there are some concerns over the basin of Karkheh River, forces have been assigned to check the floodgates, and do whatever necessary to confront a possible flash flood in the province,"" the Khuzestan governor said.The local meteorological service has warned there is a danger of floods in parts of the west and southwest of the country as well as freezing temperatures. While drought is a typical occurrence in the southern province of Khuzestan, now it’s another disaster threatening the region and putting the capabilities of local authorities to handle emergencies to the test.



The Khuzestan governor’s statement comes after Iran’s vice president, Eshaq Jahangiri, fired another governor for failing to return from a trip to Europe to oversee the management of the flood emergency in his area.According to a CIA file, Khuzestan accounts for almost 70 percent of the country’s oil production. More importantly, perhaps, the province produces almost all of Iran’s natural gas. It also houses four ports that are Iran’s largest exit point for various exports.Despite the oil wealth, Khuzestan is one of the poorest regions of Iran and it is also home to most of its Arab population, which, according to the CIA, accounts for two-thirds of the province’s total population.



This population, for its part, accounts for a small percentage of the total, at 6.5 percent, yet it is far from peaceful: last year, Arab separatists killed 29 people during a military parade in the latest outbreak of violence among a population that’s comparable in its strife to the communities in the Niger Delta.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:U.S. Didn’t Import Venezuelan Oil Last Week—For The First Time EverWhat’s Keeping Oil From Rallying To $75?Russian Troops Land In Oil-Rich Venezuela

Security forces at the Alaas field in northern Iraq have thwarted an attack by Islamic State militants, killing and injuring several attackers, Iraqi media report citing a statement from the operator of the field, North Oil Company.This is the latest in several attacks by the terrorist group on the field after it was driven out of the area in 2017. At the time, Alaas was one of the fields that IS set on fire during its retreat.While Baghdad celebrated the defeat of Islamic State after the battle for Mosul, the last remaining stronghold of the terrorist group in the country, even then there were military experts who warned that not all militants were destroyed in the push, warning that the group will sooner or later resurface.



According to security reports from the Kurdistan Regional Government from the last few months, this is already happening: according to the Kurdish forces, sleeper cells are waking up and terrorist activity is increasing.Indeed, the number of kidnappings, car bombings, assassinations of local community leaders and attacks on the grid have remained high even after the official end of the war with IS. The militants have also started targeting oil fields again. In early February, Iraqi media reported two attacks on oil police checkpoint staff in a single weekend.For now, the attacks are being thwarted successfully by the Iraqi security forces, which retook control of the northern oil fields around Kirkuk after the ill-fated independence referendum in the Kurdistan autonomous region. What’s more, the state-owned oil companies have ambitious oil production plans for the future.



Iraq had oil reserves of 153 billion barrels as of 2017, and in 2018 Oil Minister Jabar al-Luaibi said the actual reserves could be twice as large. If the higher estimate proves true, it would make Iraq the largest oil-rich country in the world, ahead of Venezuela, which claims that its reserves are just above 300 billion barrels, and also ahead of Saudi Arabia.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:What’s Keeping Oil From Rallying To $75?How Big Oil Could Become Big ElectricityWhat Norway’s Decision To Divest Means For US Shale

Amid growing global concern about the overuse of plastic, Austria’s oil and gas group OMV and Austrian Airlines have partnered to turn the plastic cups the airline’s passengers have used into synthetic crude that could be later processed into fuels or other plastic products.OMV said on Friday that it had started to process used plastic disposable cups from Austrian Airlines into synthetic crude at a pilot plant that uses a process known as thermal cracking.OMV’s ReOil pilot plant heats the plastic to over 400 degrees Celsius, and under this temperature the molecules of the plastic are cracked to produce synthetic crude oil.



“It would be better if we could convert old plastic into synthetic oil and use this resource either for producing new plastics or as energy for mobility. That would give us a circular economy for plastics, similar to paper,” says Wolfgang Hofer, Senior Expert New Technology, OMV Schwechat Refinery.The whole chain of converting plastic into synthetic crude oil goes like this: Austrian Airlines flight attendants collect plastic separately, a disposal company cleans and shreds the plastic cups and then sends them to the OMV ReOil plant, where the plastic is heated and turned into synthetic crude.                                                                                  According to OMV, 100 kilograms of used plastics can produce 100 liters of synthetic crude.



“The exceptional properties of plastic as a material mean make it hard to imagine life without it. In the ReOil pilot plant, we are able to turn the AUA drinking cups into synthetic crude and then process them into fuel or back into plastics,” Thomas Gangl, OMV Senior Vice President Refining & Petrochemicals, said in today’s statement.Airlines don’t have much of a choice in the fuel they use, as jet fuel is produced from oil, but many airlines have started to limit the use of plastic. American Airlines eliminated plastic straws in July 2018 and started to serve drinks with a biodegradable, eco-friendly straw and wood stir stick. Delta Air Lines said in October 2018 that it was working on removing single-use plastics onboard and in Delta Sky Clubs.

Despite the fact that several nuclear power plants have closed since 2010, last year’s U.S. nuclear electricity generation beat the previous record from 2010, as some plants commissioned uprates to boost generation capacity while facilities overall reduced the time for maintenance or refueling, the EIA said in its preliminary 2018 generation data.In 2018, U.S. electricity generation from nuclear power totaled 807.1 million megawatthours (MWh), slightly more than the previous peak of 807.0 million MWh in 2010, the EIA’s preliminary annual data showed.“The combination of uprates, shorter outage durations, and balance-of-plant thermal efficiency improvements led the U.S. nuclear power fleet in 2018 to see its highest capacity factor on record, at 92.6%,” the EIA said.



However, the 2018 record in nuclear electricity generation is unlikely to be beaten in the coming decades, because only two reactors are expected to come online in the near future, Georgia’s Vogtle Units 3 and 4 in 2021 and 2022, respectively. The new capacity from those two reactors will not be able to offset the closings of 12 reactors by 2025, based on the currently announced retirements, the EIA said.Related: Is Beijing Losing Its Footing In South China Sea?Between 2010 and 2018, only one new nuclear plant came online—the Tennessee Valley Authority’s (TVA) Watts Bar Unit 2 nuclear power reactor with 1.2 GW capacity, while seven nuclear power plants with a combined capacity of 5.3 GW retired between 2013 and 2018.Last year, nuclear electricity generation accounted for 19.3 percent of all U.S. utility-scale power generation, preceded by natural gas with 35.1 percent and coal with 27.4 percent, and followed by renewables including hydropower with 17.1 percent, EIA data shows.  



While wind, natural gas, and solar capacity will lead the new electricity capacity in the United States this year, coal-fired generation will account for more than half of scheduled capacity retirements, followed by natural gas with 27 percent, and nuclear with 18 percent, the EIA said in its inventory of electric generators in January.This year, two nuclear plants totaling 1.5 GW are currently scheduled to retire—the Pilgrim Nuclear Power Station in Massachusetts in May, and the remaining unit at the Three Mile Island Power Station in Pennsylvania in September.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads from Oilprice.com:Refiners Prepare To Profit From Dramatic Oil Product SwitchTrump’s Last Chance To Subdue Gasoline PricesU.S., Canadian Rig Count Plunges As Oil Retreats

The opposition-led National Assembly of Venezuela this week voted to suspend crude oil shipments to Cuba after its president, Juan Guaido, slammed these exports as “funding dark purposes” in a tweet from Sunday.The Economist Intelligence Unit reports that Guaido’s proposal was voted for unanimously and took immediate effect. However, it remains to be seen whether it will take actual effect as the Maduro government still seems to be in charge of PDVSA, the troubled national oil company.Last week, Guaido tweeted that Venezuela was sending around 47,000 bpd of crude to Cuba and these were worth US$2.58 million that would be better used at home.



“Venezuela needs more than ever to leverage its resources, rather than fund dark purposes. For years, Cuba's interference was allowed, justifying with an ideological brotherhood that was nothing more than giving away our oil,” the self-declared interim president of Venezuela said when Venezuela was struck by a large-scale power outage.Venezuela is Cuba’s largest oil supplier under a barter deal sealed by the late leaders of the two countries, Hugo Chavez and Fidel Castro. The deal envisaged Cuba getting regular shipments of crude in exchange for its highly trained doctors and other professionals to work in Venezuela.At one point during this partnership, Cuba was receiving more than 100,000 bpd of Venezuelan crude, an analysis by Oliver Pieper for Deutsche Welle said. Now, however, this is probably down by a half as Venezuela struggles to keep its fields producing. Even so, Venezuelan crude is an important part of Cuba’s energy mix and its elimination from this mix would almost certainly lead to power outages for Cuba as well.



According to the Economist Intelligence Unit, Guaido’s National Assembly cannot stop Venezuelan shipments of crude to Cuba unless the U.S., which was quick to recognize the opposition leader as the legitimate leader of Venezuela, imposed more sanctions, targeting shipping and insurance companies involved in Venezuela crude oil exports to the island.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:A Paradigm Shift In The PermianOil Is Set To Rise, But The Rally May Not LastU.S., Canadian Rig Count Plunges As Oil Retreats

Spain’s grid operator will invest billions of U.S. dollars by 2022 to accommodate and integrate a planned increase in the country’s renewable energy capacity, the grid operator Red Eléctrica de España said this week.Spain has an ambitious climate and renewables plan, which targets to have the country’s power generation go 100-percent renewable by 2050, and cut carbon emissions by 90 percent compared to 1990.As an interim target, by 2030, Spain plans to achieve a 21-percent reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions compared to 1990, have the share of renewables in final energy consumption at 42 percent, and generate 74 percent of its electricity from renewable energy sources.  



This plan, however, has been put forward by the Socialist government, whose 2019 budget was defeated in Parliament last month, resulting in Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez calling a snap election which will be held at the end of April.As José Rojo Martín of PV-Tech notes, the outcome of the elections will determine if the ambitious renewables plan will become reality.Nevertheless, the grid operator Red Eléctrica de España will invest a total of US$3.64 billion (3.221 billion euro) by 2022 in making the energy transition possible, it said in a statement on Thursday.



The planned investment for accommodating renewables accounts for more than half, or 53 percent, of the total US$6.8 billion (6 billion euro) investments the company will make by 2022.  Nearly half of the grid operator’s energy transition investment—US$1.7 billion (1.5 billion euro)—will go to integration of renewable capacity through new connections and access points. Another US$1 billion (908 million euro) is earmarked to boost the reliability of the system and security of electricity supply, US$490 million (434 million euro) will go to digitalization and technology, US$243 million (215 million euro) to energy storage projects, and US$61 million (54 million euro) to energy control systems.  By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:A Paradigm Shift In The PermianOil Is Set To Rise, But The Rally May Not LastU.S., Canadian Rig Count Plunges As Oil Retreats

Five U.S. Democratic presidential hopefuls would re-join—if elected president—the Iranian nuclear deal, from which U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew last year imposing sanctions on Iran’s oil industry, Al-Monitor reports, citing direct communication with spokespersons and aides for the Democrats who have declared they would run to win their party’s nomination.The five Democrats who would work to re-enter the nuclear deal include Senators Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and Kamala Harris, a mayor from Florida, Wayne Messam, and spiritual leader Marianne Williamson, Al-Monitor’s congressional correspondent Bryant Harris writes.Other Democratic candidates were either more evasive on their stance on Iran and the nuclear deal or didn’t return Al-Monitor’s request for comment. Those who did not respond include Beto O’Rourke, Amy Klobuchar, Kirsten Gillibrand, and Tulsi Gabbard, all of whom had voted for the deal with Iran in 2015.



According to various advocacy groups who talked to Al-Monitor, re-entering a deal with Iran is generally viewed as an important policy point for any Democratic presidential candidate to challenge President Trump.President Trump ended in May last year the United States participation in the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) as the Iran nuclear deal is officially known, saying that the deal is “unacceptable” and “The Iran Deal was one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has ever entered into.”The withdrawal of the U.S. from the deal meant the U.S. was re-imposing sanctions that had been lifted under the agreement between Iran and the global superpowers.



The U.S. re-imposed sanctions on Iran’s oil industry in early November and continues to target zero Iranian oil exports. Yet, Washington granted waivers to eight key Iranian oil customers which sent oil prices down because Saudi Arabia and Russia had preemptively boosted production to offset what was expected to be zero Iranian oil supply.The waivers are set to expire in early May, and the general view of analysts is that the U.S. will extend at least some of the exemptions for some of Iran’s oil buyers to avoid a spike in oil prices.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Is Beijing Losing Its Footing In South China Sea?Refiners Prepare To Profit From Dramatic Oil Product SwitchWhy OPEC’s Decision To Delay Makes Sense

Exxon could lose its lobbying access to the European parliament after no company representative showed up at a hearing on climate change denial, the Guardian reports.A member of the European parliament from the Green party has already submitted a request to ban the company.“This is the company that denied the science, despite knowing the damage their oil exploitation was causing; which funded campaigns to block action on climate and now refuses to face up to its environmental crimes by attending today’s hearing. We cannot allow the lobbyists from such corporations free access to the corridors of the European parliament. We must remove their badges immediately,” Molly Scott Cato wrote in her request.



The company, however, said it was prevented from attending the hearing because of “ongoing climate change-related litigation in the US”. In a statement sent to the British daily, Exxon elaborated: “We reject the false allegation that ExxonMobil suppressed scientific research on climate change. News reports that claim we reached definitive conclusions about the science of climate change decades before the world’s experts are simply not accurate and have long since been debunked.”Exxon has been targeted by environmentalists and other anti-oil groups at home, and just recently two municipalities in California—San Francisco and Oakland—renewed their fight to return their lawsuit against the supermajor and four other Big Oil companies to court.San Francisco and Oakland are suing Chevron, Exxon, Shell, BP, and ConocoPhillips for selling oil products despite their knowledge of the effect these products had on the environment. Last week, they approached a federal appeals court with a request to reinstate their lawsuits against the Big Oil companies, which a U.S. District Judge dismissed last year.



In Europe, Exxon has spent more than US$35 million on lobbying at the European Parliament since 2010, according to figures from the Corporate Europe Observatory cited by the Guardian.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Refiners Prepare To Profit From Dramatic Oil Product SwitchTrump’s Last Chance To Subdue Gasoline Prices“Perfect Storm” Drives Oil Prices Higher

The Mexican government plans to use money from a public income stabilization fund to help reduce the sizeable debt pile that state energy major Pemex has accumulated.Reuters reports, quoting the country’s deputy finance minister, that the fund is worth US$15.4 billion and the government plans to make it “counter cyclical.”“We’d like to design it as a counter cyclical fund, like the copper funds in Chile are designed, where the resources are used not when the government wants to, but when the economy makes them necessary... In times of abundance, you put money into these resources,” Arturo Herrera said, adding “As a second part of the fund, we’d like to use it to pay some of the debt obligations that Pemex has.”



The state company has around US$16 billion in bond payments due by the end of 2020, but its total debt is over US$100 billion. In an effort to slim this down, earlier this year the Obrador administration said it would inject US$3.6 billion into the company in the form of debt refinancing and tax cuts.The injection should also help Pemex boost local oil and gas production as a means of improving revenues and income despite a suspension of new oil and gas block tenders while the administration reviews the contracts the Pena-Nieto government signed with foreign oil companies in a bid to reverse a consistent decline in production.Related: U.S. ‘’Oil Weapon’’ Could Change Geopolitics ForeverPresident Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised that by the end of his term in office, Mexico will produce almost 2.5 million bpd of crude – a level close to the 2013 average of 2.522 million bpd and considerably higher than Mexico’s current average of less than 1.7 million bpd.



As part of the production decline reversal plan, Pemex also increased its spending plans for this year. In December, the company said it had budgeted US$23 billion for 2019, up by 15 percent on 2018. Half of the total will be directed towards exploration and production, with some onshore deposits also benefitting from the investment alongside shallow-water blocks. By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Oil Is Set To Rise, But The Rally May Not LastA Paradigm Shift In The PermianTesla Lagging Behind Competitors In European EV Markets

Iran has delivered for export the first shipment from a new development phase of the giant gas field South Pars, including 300,000 barrels of condensate, Iranian media report, quoting the operator of the South Pars phase 13 project.The delivery of the cargo for export was made last week, before Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani officially inaugurated four new phases of development at South Pars.This past weekend, Rouhani officially launched four new development phases at the giant South Pars offshore gas field, which will add 110 million cubic meters to the daily output of the field. The expansion costs US$11 billion, Reuters reports.



Last week, Iran’s Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said that South Pars would produce from 27 phases of development within a year.  After the U.S. sanctions on its oil industry returned and forced international companies to withdraw from doing business with Iran, the Islamic Republic is now developing various phases at the South Pars by itself and claims that it is doing a good job despite the U.S. sanctions.  France’s supermajor Total had signed a deal to take part in the development of phase 11 of South Pars. But after the U.S. withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal, Total said in May last year that it would not be in a position to continue the South Pars 11 gas project and would have to unwind all related operations before November 4, 2018, unless it was granted a specific project waiver—which it was not.



Iran, for its part, claims that its progress in energy continues despite the U.S. sanctions. At the launch of the new phases at South Pars, Rouhani said that “all the major projects, including the largest gas condensate refinery,” were brought on line, Iranian media report.“Americans did not want us to inaugurate any important projects during the current year, but we made all projects operational on schedule,” Rouhani said, according to Fars news agency.

While Iranian customers have started negotiations with the U.S. on possible waiver extensions to continue buying oil from Tehran, Iran’s oil exports so far in March are down from January and February to average around 1 million bpd-1.1 million bpd, Reuters reported on Thursday, citing industry sources and ship-tracking data.This compares to around 1.3 million bpd estimated Iranian exports for February.The U.S. waivers for eight key Iranian oil customers, including China, India, Japan, and South Korea, expire in early May. While the U.S. Administration says that it continues to pursue zero Iranian oil exports, analysts expect Washington to extend waivers to at least a few of the currently exempted buyers, with reduced volumes allowed under the new waivers, as the Administration wouldn’t want to push oil prices too high.



In January and February this year, Iranian crude oil exports were higher than expected, as several of Iran’s customers were using up their U.S. sanction waivers to continue importing Iranian oil, according to industry sources and shipping data, quoted by Reuters 10 days before the end of February.According to tanker-tracking data from Refinitiv Eikon and a source at a company tracking Iranian oil flows, Iran’s exports in February averaged 1.25 million bpd, while the January exports were between 1.1 million bpd and 1.3 million bpd, higher than the previously expected below 1-million-bpd level, which was seen in December.While tracking Iran’s oil exports has become an increasingly difficult task after the U.S. sanctions returned in early November, some of the key Iranian oil customers that received U.S. waivers resumed Iranian oil purchases in 2019 or increased imports to their respective ceiling allowed under the waivers, after an initial ‘wait-and-see mode’ for November and December purchases amid uncertainties who is getting waivers.Related: Tesla Lagging Behind Competitors In European EV Markets



As the ‘waivers window’ will be shrinking as we approach early May, buyers may be rushing to buy what they can before April in order to be able to complete transactions before May in case waivers are not extended, according to analysts.Japanese refiners, for example, are unlikely to continue buying Iranian crude from April onwards, the president of the Petroleum Association of Japan, Takashi Tsukuoka, said earlier this week, as quoted by Reuters.However, Tsukuoka added that refiners would continue importing Iranian crude if Tokyo agreed on a sanction waiver extension, which it was currently negotiating with Washington.

Reliance Industries has started selling oil products including the popular diluent naphtha to PDVSA from its Indian and European subsidiaries after it suspended oil product sales to the troubled Venezuelan company from its U.S. subsidiary to avoid getting punished for sanction violations.Reuters reports, citing shipping data, that India’s largest oil refiner had sent at least three tankers with oil products to Venezuela in the last few weeks and has scheduled another one to carry a load of gasoil.The news comes on the heels of another report from Reuters that quoted Azerbaijan’s energy ministry with a statement saying that Venezuela had stopped exporting crude to India, a key market along with China and Russia.



“Russia and China are seen as the main destinations because of the suspension of oil exports to India,”  the statement said, adding “[Venezuela Oil Minister] Quevedo said in order to prevent a sharp reduction, various measures are being implemented and diversification of the export market is underway.”The U.S. sanctions on Venezuela’s oil at the end of January essentially cut off Venezuelan exports to the United States. Washington has also warned other countries against buying oil from Nicolas Maduro’s regime and has been pressing India to refrain from buying Venezuelan crude.The U.S. cannot force other economies to completely stop buying Venezuelan crude under its sanctions, but this could happen if Washington imposes so-called secondary sanctions that would target companies based outside the United States.



Reuters reports Venezuela has been importing fuel and diluents at a daily rate of 160,000 bpd since the latest round of U.S. sanctions came into effect. It needs the diluents to make its extra-heavy oil liquid enough to be loaded on tankers. According to Reuters shipping data, there is a tanker at the Venezuelan Jose port right now about to start its journey to India despite Quevedo’s declaration of export suspension.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:A Paradigm Shift In The PermianTesla Lagging Behind Competitors In European EV MarketsCanada’s Natural Gas Crisis Is Going Under The Radar

Murphy Oil Corporation has signed a deal to sell its assets in Malaysia, becoming the latest U.S. company to exit projects abroad as it focuses on high-margin opportunities in U.S. shale.Murphy Oil will exit Malaysia after 20 years after it signed a deal with a subsidiary of PTT Exploration and Production Public Company Limited to sell its two primary Malaysian subsidiaries for US$2.127 billion in cash, payable upon closing and subject to customary closing adjustments, the U.S. firm said on Thursday.Murphy Oil will use the proceeds to return cash to shareholders through share buybacks and to cut debt, while it will be focusing primarily on the Eagle Ford shale play and on its operations in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.



A total of US$750 million of the remaining proceeds will be “earmarked for U.S. oil-weighted opportunities through potential acquisitions and/or the funding of both deep water projects and U.S. onshore opportunities,” the company said.“We will continue with our plans of investing in our high margin, oil-weighted Western Hemisphere opportunities, especially the Eagle Ford Shale and the Gulf of Mexico while maintaining our focused low-cost exploration program,” said Roger W. Jenkins, President and CEO.Last month, Marathon Oil said that it would be exiting the UK North Sea as it continues to focus on high-return U.S. shale oil operations. Houston-based Marathon Oil has signed an agreement with independent UK company RockRose Energy to sell its UK businesses, which held interests in several fields in the UK part of the North Sea.Related: U.S. On The Hunt For Iranian “Ghost Tankers”

Brazilian state-held oil firm Petrobras is re-evaluating a preliminary deal with China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) to build an oil refinery in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazilian economic newspaper Valor Economico reported on Thursday, citing a source from Petrobras’ management.Petrobras signed in October an agreement with CNPC’s subsidiary China National Oil and Gas Exploration and Development Company (CNODC) to carry out a feasibility study to assess the investment case for the COMPERJ refinery in Brazil. Once the study is completed, the companies plan to create a joint venture to complete the construction and operate the refinery. Petrobras will have an 80 percent stake in the joint venture, and CNPC will own the remaining 20 percent.However, according to Valor Economico’s source, the oil refinery partnership—which was struck during the previous top management of Petrobras—clashes with the ideas of new chief executive Roberto Castello Branco, who is pushing for divestments at Petrobras, including in the oil refinery business.



China, via CNPC and its various subsidiaries, has been forming partnerships around the world lately and has been investing in the oil industries of countries like Venezuela and South Sudan. China has also extended loans to Venezuela and South Sudan, in exchange for future repayment in crude oil.Meanwhile, CNPC’s listed arm PetroChina said on Thursday that it would be pursuing deeper cooperation with the U.S. energy sector, hoping that it could help the world’s two biggest economies to resolve their trade dispute.“Through this cooperation we can improve [the countries’] trade structure, which is conducive for the diversification of our energy import sources,” PetroChina’s president Hou Qijun said at the firm’s 2018 results release, as carried by South China Morning Post.  



The progress in the U.S.-China trade talks has made PetroChina more confident in seeking to expand its energy cooperation with the United States, which has the capability to become a top natural gas exporter at a time when China’s natural gas needs and imports are growing fast, according to PetroChina’s president.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads from Oilprice.com:U.S. Didn’t Import Venezuelan Oil Last Week—For The First Time EverOne Last Warning For The U.S. Shale PatchCanada’s Natural Gas Crisis Is Going Under The Radar

A federal judge blocked oil and gas drilling in part of Wyoming, claiming the Department of the Interior had not considered the implications of drilling with respect to climate change when it organized its lease sales.The Associated Press quotes U.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras as saying in his ruling that ""Given the national, cumulative nature of climate change, considering each individual drilling project in a vacuum deprives the agency and the public of the context necessary to evaluate oil and gas drilling on federal land.""Contreras added that the Bureau of Land Management needed to consider the environmental impact of oil and gas drilling from the past, the present, and the foreseeable future before they line up land plots to lease to drillers.



Interestingly, the ruling is on a case that predates the pro-oil Trump administration that has opened up more federal land to drilling. Bloomberg recalls the case was brought to court by two environmentalist groups back in 2016. The plaintiffs asked that drilling be stopped on federal lands in Wyoming, Utah, and Colorado. Contreras effectively put a stop to oil and gas drilling across 300,000 acres in Wyoming.Now, the Bureau of Land Management will need to conduct a new environmental review focusing on emissions before it issues new drilling permits.Meanwhile, an oil lease in the Gulf of Mexico yesterday attracted US$244 million in bids, signaling the oil industry’s renewed interest in the legacy producing region as production prices slip lower.



The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management tendered all federal territory open for drilling, 78.5 million acres in total. Bids were placed on 1.26 million acres, which is better than what the previous Gulf of Mexico auction attracted. After the Contreras ruling, interest in the Gulf might increase further if drillers decide onshore drilling in some parts of the States is becoming too risky an endeavor.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Is Beijing Losing Its Footing In South China Sea?Refiners Prepare To Profit From Dramatic Oil Product SwitchWhy OPEC’s Decision To Delay Makes Sense

Canada’s federal government does not consider the Albertan oil industry a priority despite its central importance to the provincial economy, the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers said after Ottawa released its 2019 budget.""They're recognizing that the investment levels are down, they're recognizing that prices are down and that unemployment is up, and yet they're not really taking any meaningful action to support our industry,"" the group’s vice-president of oilsands, Ben Brunnen, said as quoted by CBC.""The reality is, when we see those indicators all facing down, from an oil and gas perspective, and no recognition from the government of a willingness to support our industry, it's a pretty strong message towards our industry that we're not a priority for this government, and that's disappointing,"" Brunnen added.



The budget includes funds for retraining initiatives that could help with Alberta’s high unemployment problem, but according to CAPP, this is not enough.Alberta’s oil industry may not be a priority for Ottawa, but it certainly is a priority for everyone running in this year’s elections, scheduled for April 16. The Canadian Press reported this week that oil and gas investments and carbon tax were central topics on the campaign trail.Incumbent Premier Rachel Notley has promised to increase local oil and gas processing capacity while her rival from the United Conservative party, Jason Kenney, focused on the carbon tax approved by the Notley government.



Notley’s plan aims to reduce the amount of crude oil Alberta exports, therefore reducing the need for transportation capacity including pipelines—nowhere in sight—and oil trains. It should bring in tens of billions of dollars in fresh investments.Kenney, on the other hand, promised his first order of business would be to repeal the carbon tax that is “punishing” Albertans. This, he said, would save the province more than US$1billion (C$1.4 billion) every year “in one fell swoop.”By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:One Last Warning For The U.S. Shale PatchIs Beijing Losing Its Footing In South China Sea?Refiners Prepare To Profit From Dramatic Oil Product Switch

Petrofac workers on BP offshore platforms plan to walk out of all platforms as a result of an unresolved dispute regarding work rota arrangements.“The workforce are rightly demanding that their rotas be changed from the hated 3:3, and to have more time off with their families. So, we call on BP and Petrofac to listen to our members’ reasonable request, and to put the welfare of their workforce first,” City AM quoted a regional industrial officer for trade union Unite, John Boland, as saying.The workers are demanding a 3:4 ratio between leave and work, with three weeks of paid leave versus the two that platform operators and owners are offering. The votes in favor of industrial action have been overwhelming, according to Boland. The dates of the strike will be announced later.



This is not the first spark of disgruntlement among offshore platform workers in the North Sea. Earlier this month workers striked at four Total platforms operated by Petrofac and Aker. More than 200 workers voted for the industrial action, the BBC reported at the time. The 24-hour strikes were scheduled for two days in March and two days in April.Again, the issue were the rotas Total had imposed on the platform crews, a 3:3 scheme, which Unite claimed was a health risk.For now, the strikes have not disrupted production at any field, but if it gathers enough steam, it might have an effect on the normal operation of a recovering industry.



Earlier this week, Oil and Gas UK, the energy industry association, boasted that the UK’s North Sea had, since 2014, swung back into growth mode as far as production is concerned after 14 years of declines thanks to better recovery rates and several new discoveries. OGUK also warned that investments had to keep coming in order to avert another decline and keep production relatively stable in the coming decade.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:One Last Warning For The U.S. Shale PatchU.S. And China Hold Key To Higher Oil PricesWhy OPEC’s Decision To Delay Makes Sense

Middle Eastern oil producer Oman denied on Wednesday that it was part of an oil refinery project worth US$3.85 billion in Sri Lanka, announced by Sri Lanka officials on Tuesday.“No one on this side of the panel is aware of this investment in Sri Lanka,” Reuters quoted Salim al-Aufi, undersecretary of Oman’s ministry of oil and gas, as saying at a news conference on Wednesday.On Tuesday, Sri Lankan officials told reporters that the oil and gas ministry of the Sultanate of Oman would control 30 percent in the oil refinery project in Sri Lanka, while the majority holder would be Indian privately held Accord Group via Singapore-based investment vehicle Silver Park International Private Limited.



“This is the biggest foreign investment in the country’s history,” the Associated Press quoted Sri Lanka’s deputy minister of international trade, Nalin Bandara, as saying on Tuesday at the announcement of the project.Yet, it appears that Oman was neither involved in this investment nor was it aware of it, because al-Aufi said on Wednesday, “It came as news to me,” as carried by Reuters.   The project is for the construction of an oil refinery with a processing capacity of 200,000 bpd. Construction is expected to start within days and complete in 44 months, according to the Sri Lankan officials. Most of the refined oil products are expected to be exported from the Hambantota port, which is controlled by a Chinese company.



Growing Chinese influence in Sri Lanka has been a concern for India, which views the Indian Ocean as its strategic and historic area of influence.China, for its part, was on track until recently to be the largest investor in Sri Lanka, so a large-scale Indian investment would be a challenge to its investment ambitions, Reuters notes.Amid all of this, it appears that Oman—one of the smaller Middle Eastern oil producers and not a member of OPEC—wasn’t aware that it was involved in plans to invest in a refinery in Sri Lanka.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Oilfield Services Might Not Fully Recover Till 2025Gas Mergers Could Pressure Prices In EuropeHas The U.S. Lost The Nordstream 2 Battle?

The U.S. Administration has renewed for another 90 days a sanctions waiver for Iraq to continue importing energy from neighboring Iran despite the American sanctions on Tehran, an official with the U.S. State Department told Reuters on Wednesday.   “Iraq was granted a 90-day waiver to purchase energy imports from Iran,” the official told Reuters on condition of anonymity.This is the third waiver for Iraq—which depends on Iranian electricity and natural gas imports for part of its energy needs—that the United States has granted since it re-imposed sanctions on Iran’s oil, energy, and shipping industries in early November 2018.At the end of last year, the U.S. granted Iraq a 90-day extension to the initial 45-day waiver allowing Baghdad to continue imports of electricity from Iran after the U.S. sanctions on Tehran returned.



Major Iraqi power plants are dependent on Iranian natural gas supply, while Iraq also imports electricity from Iran, as Baghdad’s power generation is not enough to ensure domestic supply.Iraq has argued that it needs more time to find alternative sources of electricity supply if it is to avoid more and more power outages, which is one of the main reasons for protest rallies in the heart of Iraq’s oil region in the southern city of Basra last summer.The United States, for its part, has been urging Iraq to become energy independent, at least energy independent from Iran.Related: Trump’s Last Chance To Subdue Gasoline PricesAt his keynote address at the CERAWeek energy conference in Houston last week, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that the U.S. is encouraging countries to partner with the U.S. for their energy security.



“We’re reminding them that we’re simply better to do business with than Russia, China, or Iran,” Pompeo said, calling out Iran for the energy influence it exerts over Iraq.  “Perhaps there’s no clearer example than in Iran. Iran uses its energy exports to exert undue influence all across the Middle East, most particularly today on Iraq. While the United States is working to develop an independent, sovereign Iraq, Iran is using its energy to create a vassal state,” Secretary Pompeo said.

Norway’s taxation legislation allowing companies to claim refunds for exploration costs is not the same as state aid, the EFTA Surveillance Authority (ESA) said on Wednesday after examining a complaint filed by environmental non-profit organization Bellona.Bellona filed a complaint with the European Free Trade Agreement (EFTA) Surveillance Authority in August 2017, arguing that Norway’s annual cash refund constitutes unlawful state aid.Norway introduced the refund system in 2005 “to reduce the entry barriers for new actors and encourage economically viable exploration activity,” under its petroleum taxation system.



Under the measure that provides exploration cost refunds, companies that incur a loss may choose between an immediate refund of the tax value of exploration costs from the taxation authorities and carrying forward the losses to a later year when the company may have taxable income.Bellona has argued that the exploration costs refunds are discriminatory against petroleum activities other than exploration and against renewable energy such as solar and wind, and therefore constitutes unlawful state aid from the Norwegian state by giving a selective advantage to certain companies.“Having scrutinised it on the basis of a comprehensive complaint, ESA is satisfied that this tax rule does not entail state aid”, ESA’s President Bente Angell-Hansen said in a statement today. 



“ESA has now concluded that the measure is not selective,” the authority added, noting that “According to EEA state aid rules, a measure that is not selective does not constitute state aid.”The European Economic Area (EEA) unites the EU member states and the three EEA EFTA states, Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway.Meanwhile, Norway’s government proposed last week to expand the area that will be offered for oil and gas exploration in the 2019 licensing round of acreage in mature areas, hoping that more discoveries could be made to offset an expected decline in Norwegian oil production from the mid-2020s onwards.

Japanese refiners are unlikely to continue buying Iranian crude from April onwards, the president of the Petroleum Association of Japan said as quoted by Reuters.However, Takashi Tsukuoka added they would continue importing Iranian crude if Tokyo agreed on a sanction waiver extension, which it was currently negotiating with Washington.This makes Japan the second country to try and negotiate a waiver extension, after India entered identical talks earlier this month. Washington has signaled it would probably agree to some form of an extension as long as the importing countries agree to reduce their intake of Iranian crude.



Japan has been very strict in following Washington’s lead in the sanction department, but it has also indicated that finding an alternative to Iranian crude might be tough.“Japan has told the U.S. that the sanctions should not negatively affect Japan’s stable supply of energy and Japanese companies’ operations,” one government official in Tokyo said, commenting on the waiver negotiations to Reuters.Japanese refiners stopped buying Iranian crude ahead of the November 4, 2018, deadline set by Washington to all countries doing business with Iran before economic sanctions returned. A month later, Tsukuoka told media local refiners would restart buying Iranian crude in January, adding ""We aim to lift as much as possible over January-March to keep our hope for the next [period].""



Before the U.S. sanctions snapped back, Iran accounted for 5 percent of Japan’s crude oil intake, and as Tsukioka said last September, Tokyo was going to try to maintain a good relationship with Tehran despite the sanctions.This will be difficult to accomplish in light of Washington’s plans to gradually press Iranian oil exports as low as they can get without plunging the oil market into a panic that would cause prices to shoot up.Japan—like Iran’s other major imports including China, India, and South Korea—is highly dependent on imported fuels.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:U.S. On The Hunt For Iranian “Ghost Tankers”Morgan Stanley: Oil To Rise To $75 This SummerOil Prices Shoot Up On Large Inventory Draw

BP is planning to start powering some of its operations in the United States with electricity produced by solar farms, Bloomberg reports, quoting the chief executive of an affiliate, Lightsource BP.The UK-based supermajor bought a 43-percent stake in Lightsource two years ago, committing to spend US$200 million on the company over a period of three years.“It’s a no brainer for them to play in solar,” Lightsource’s chief executive Katherine Ryzhaya told Bloomberg. “They’re doing it for financial reasons.”



Indeed, solar power is becoming increasingly competitive as production costs fall and efficiency rates rise, the former faster than the latter. Also, there is the reputation management element that supermajors are no doubt pursuing by turning to renewables to power their oil and gas business.Last year, even Exxon, which is notorious for its conservative attitude to renewables, sealed a deal with Danish renewable energy company Orsted to buy 500 MW of electricity produced by solar and wind farms to power its oil production in the Permian. Although the terms of the contract remained undisclosed, it was the largest such contract featuring an oil company as a party as of 2018.Like Exxon, BP has been the target of a lot of criticism—and lawsuits—regarding its attitude to climate change and renewable energy use, not to mention the fallout of the Deepwater Horizon disaster.



The Lightsource move, therefore, makes sense for the supermajor in more than one way. It is also in tune with a commitment to reduce its carbon footprint from earlier this year, while continuing to increase production.Earlier this month, BP also announced it had struck a partnership with the Environmental Defense Fund to work together on reducing methane emissions in the oil and gas industry globally. The collaboration will focus on methane reduction and management technology, the company said at the time.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Trump’s Last Chance To Subdue Gasoline PricesRefiners Prepare To Profit From Dramatic Oil Product SwitchWorld’s Top Commodity Trader Sees Peak Oil Demand Looming

OPEC and its non-OPEC allies could sign in June a pact to make their oil market-managing policies formal, Suhail Al Mazrouei, the energy minister of one of OPEC’s largest producers, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), said on Wednesday.“When we meet in June hopefully we are going to be finalising [the charter],” Al Mazrouei said in Abu Dhabi today, as carried by The National.“The draft is almost finished for us here in the UAE. All of the countries have provided their comments. The draft is almost ready,” the UAE minister noted.



The charter is ready and has been sent to different countries to look at it, Al Mazrouei said, adding that questions remain regarding when and where it could be signed and who would actually be signing it.OPEC has sought for months to institutionalize its partnership with the Russia-led alliance of non-OPEC producers with which it has been managing oil supply since January 2017.  In June last year, Saudi Arabia’s Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said at a joint OPEC/no-OPEC panel meeting that in order to deal with the challenges and complexities of the oil market balances, “we need to build upon our successful cooperation model and institutionalize its success through a broader and more permanent strategically focused framework.”



The December OPEC+ meeting in Vienna also committed “to build on the success achieved thus far, through further institutionalizing the framework for regular and lasting cooperation under the draft Charter of Cooperation between Oil Producing Countries, which was endorsed in principle and to be finalized and ratified by the participating countries.”Russia, however, signaled at the end of 2018 that formalizing the alliance may not be such a good idea. OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers are highly unlikely to create some kind of a formal joint organization for managing the oil market due to the additional bureaucracy and to the risk of falling prey to a proposed U.S. legislation that could open the cartel and allies to antitrust lawsuits, Russia’s Energy Minister Alexander Novak said at the end of December.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Trump’s Last Chance To Subdue Gasoline PricesOPEC Threatens To Kill U.S. ShaleIEA Warns Of Looming Oil Market Deficit

Despite its notoriety as a legacy producing region, the UK’s continental shelf yielded 20 percent more oil and gas in the last five years after 14 consecutive years of production declines, the industry’s association, Oil and Gas UK, said in its latest annual Business Outlook.The figure for 2018 was 1.7 million barrels of oil equivalent daily and it covered 59 percent of the country’s oil and gas demand, the industry body noted, adding that newly approved projects last year exceeded the total number for the previous three years combined, at 13. These, OGUK said, will tap into 400 million barrels of oil equivalent. Capital spending on these projects is estimated at around US$4.37 billion (3.3 billion pounds).



Exploration in the UK’s North Sea is definitely picking up and this year could see the drilling of up to 15 new wells, the association also said. This is momentum that needs to be maintained, the association noted, as expectations were for another decline in production to begin after 2020.Over the longer term, the investment flow will need to keep flowing into new exploration and production to keep output rising. In its Vision 2035, OGUK estimated the industry needed to add another generation to the productive life of the UK’s continental shelf and said this would need investments of around US$264.8 billion (200 billion pounds).



Meanwhile, ownership and operatorship patterns are changing, the industry body said in its report. Private equity firms are increasing their holdings in the UK continental shelf, and so are some energy independents. Interestingly enough, these independents are focusing on legacy fields, to which they are applying a “fit-for-purpose” approach.This focus may have something to do with the low rate of successful discoveries, which sank to a record low last year. Even so, optimism about exploration persists, perhaps thanks in no small part to the fact that two of the biggest conventional oil and gas discoveries in the UK’s continental shelf were made last year, Glendronach and Glengorm.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Oil Prices Shoot Up On Large Inventory DrawTrump’s Last Chance To Subdue Gasoline PricesOilfield Services Might Not Fully Recover Till 2025

Nursultan Nazarbayev, the President of Kazakhstan of 30 years and the last Soviet-era leader in power in a former Soviet republic, unexpectedly resigned on Tuesday, but is widely expected to retain power over the country’s politics and policies.Nazarbayev, viewed as an autocrat as many of the other rulers of Central Asian nations, noted in his resignation speech that during his three-decade tenure since 1989 Kazakhstan managed to attract foreign investment in its commodities industries and set up a sovereign wealth fund thanks to oil and gas revenues.Kazakhstan has tripled its oil production over the past 30 years and is currently taking part in the OPEC/non-OPEC deal to reduce output. Kazakhstan’s production cap under the agreement is 1.86 million bpd, down by 40,000 bpd from its November production level. 



 “I have made a difficult decision for myself - to resign from the powers of the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan,” Nazarbayev said in an address on Tuesday, but noted that he would remain the Chairman of the Security Council, “which is vested with serious powers.”“That is to say, I am staying with you,” said Nazarbayev in what analysts see as a prepared political transition that would still give the now former president considerable power over Kazakhstan.Nazarbayev, who was the only president of independent Kazakhstan until yesterday, handed over the presidential power to the Chairman of the Senate, Kassym-Jomart Kemelovich Tokayev, until the end of the presidential term in office, April 2020. Kazakhstan is slated to hold presidential and general elections next year.



In order to comply with the OPEC+ deal, Kazakhstan will shut down most of the production at its giant Kashagan field—one of the world’s largest offshore oil fields—by nearly 200,000 bpd in April and May, before ramping up again in June, Energy Minister Kanat Bozumbayev said just a few days ago.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Oilfield Services Might Not Fully Recover Till 2025Gas Mergers Could Pressure Prices In EuropeHas The U.S. Lost The Nordstream 2 Battle?

South Sudan, ravaged by years of conflict, should immediately stop contracting expensive and nontransparent oil advances, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said in its latest report on the African nation, which has taken loans from Chinese companies with the promise to repay them with proceeds from future oil revenues—from oil it has yet to get out of the ground.South Sudan is still struggling to return to the level of oil production it had at the start of this decade, after the civil war and the oil price crash nearly halved its oil output.South Sudan broke from Sudan in 2011 and took with it around 350,000 bpd in oil production. But then civil war in South Sudan broke out in 2013 that further complicated oil production. The oil price crash the following year additionally affected oil income and oil production in South Sudan.



Hoping to out an end to this war, South Sudan’s government and rebels signed a power-sharing agreement in September 2018. Oil production at some oil fields that were shut in at the start of the conflict has resumed. Strugglingto get it’s oil industry back on its feet, South Sudan is now looking to pump more than 350,000 bpd of oil by the middle of next year, compared to current production of just 140,000 bpd, South Sudan’s Oil Minister Ezekiel Lul Gatkuoth said earlier this year.However, until more oil is really pumped out of the ground, South Sudan should carefully manage oil revenues and stop taking oil advances and focus on spending those revenues on immediate peace-related purposes instead, according to the IMF.Related: Oil Slips As Alberta Relaxes Oil Production Cuts



“On the management of oil revenues, the mission urges the authorities to immediately stop contracting oil advances that are expensive and nontransparent. This measure will also help to ensure that oil revenues will be fully available for financing budgetary spending,” the IMF said.In addition, those oil advances are tightening South Sudan’s finances, the fund said, noting that “Fiscal conditions for the remainder of 2018/19 will be constrained by large repayments of oil advances. With a tight resource envelope, the authorities should strictly prioritize core peace-related spending and payment of civil servant salaries.”Apart from extending loans, Chinese companies are also dominant in South Sudan’s oil industry. Oil Minister Gatkuoth met with CNPC in Beijing earlier this month and urged the Chinese state energy conglomerate “to bring new production on-stream at its concessions by exploring for new oilfields.” By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Cuba Faces Oil Crisis As Venezuela CrumblesHas The U.S. Lost The Nordstream 2 Battle?Gas Mergers Could Pressure Prices In Europe

Venezuela has suspended crude oil exports to India, one of its key markets until very recently, Reuters reported on Tuesday, citing a statement from the energy ministry of Azerbaijan, where Venezuela’s Oil Minister Manuel Quevedo is on a visit for this past weekend’s OPEC+ panel meeting and for talks with his Azeri counterpart.“Russia and China are seen as the main destinations because of the suspension of oil exports to India,” Reuters quoted the Azeri ministry as saying in a statement after a meeting between the Venezuelan and Azeri oil and energy ministers on Tuesday.“Quevedo said in order to prevent a sharp reduction, various measures are being implemented and diversification of the export market is underway,” the statement further reads, as carried by Reuters.



India has been one of the largest buyers of Venezuelan oil and the second-largest customer paying in cash, following the United States. Russia and China, which Maduro sees as priority markets, are owed money by Venezuela that repays loans to Moscow and Beijing mostly with crude oil shipments.The U.S. sanctions on Venezuela’s oil at the end of January essentially cut off Venezuelan exports to the United States. Washington has also warned other countries against buying oil from Nicolas Maduro’s regime and has been pressing India to refrain from buying Venezuelan crude. Related: Cuba Faces Oil Crisis As Venezuela CrumblesLast month, U.S. National Security Advisor John Bolton warned countries and companies against buying crude oil from Venezuela after Manuel Quevedo said during a surprise visit to India that Venezuela was looking to sell more oil to the fast-growing Indian market.



In a tweet with a Bloomberg article on Venezuelan-Indian oil relations attached, Bolton wrote: “Nations and firms that support Maduro’s theft of Venezuelan resources will not be forgotten. The United States will continue to use all of its powers to preserve the Venezuelan people’s assets and we encourage all nations to work together to do the same.”The United States has also pressed India to stop buying Venezuelan crude oil as a means of accelerating Nicolas Maduro’s removal from office.“We say you should not be helping this regime. You should be on the side of the Venezuelan people,” the U.S. envoy for Venezuela Elliott Abrams told Reuters in an interview published earlier this month.

Pemex will drill three times more new wells this year than previously planned, Reuters reported, citing the company’s chief executive. This should boost production by 300,000 bpd by 2022, which would be a new record, CEO Octavio Romero said at a presentation.Pemex has been struggling with declining oil and gas production for over a decade. The previous government opened up the industry to foreign investment by organizing several tenders for oil and gas blocks in a bid to reverse the fall. The new government, however, has suspended tenders until it reviews the contracts signed by the previous administration.



The Obrador administration has prioritized the increase in local oil and gas production and to this end earlier this year provided a US$3.6-billion lifeline for Pemex, who had accumulated uncomfortable amounts of debt—US$106 billion—over the past few years. Boosting production is crucial for the company and the government, which has promised better energy security for Mexico.“In Petroleos Mexicanos’ entire history, it has perhaps never developed 20 new fields in one year,” Romero told media, adding that these measures should help production begin to climb up as early as this year. At the moment, it is 1.68 million bpd but, Romero said, “We can expect this level of production to be maintained and that it will begin to grow from this year.”



President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised that by the end of his term in office, Mexico will produce almost 2.5 million bpd of crude – a level close to the 2013 average of 2.522 million bpd.As part of the production decline reversal plan, Pemex also increased its spending plans for this year. In December, the company said it had budgeted US$23 billion for 2019, up by 15 percent on 2018. Half of the total will be directed towards exploration and production, with some onshore deposits also benefitting from the investment alongside shallow-water blocks. Exploration in the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico, however, will be put on hold.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:World’s Top Commodity Trader Sees Peak Oil Demand LoomingMarkets Brace For U.S. Decision On Iran Sanction WaiversWhy Russia Fails To Comply With The OPEC+ Cuts

The Securities and Exchange Commission has approached a Manhattan court accusing Tesla chief executive Elon Musk of violating an agreement with the regulator that required him to seek approval from the company’s board for any tweet that might affect Tesla’s share price.Reuters reports, quoting the SEC court filing, that the regulator accused Musk of not asking the approval of Tesla’s board of directors for any tweets posted since the agreement was made. The watchdog said it had asked the Tesla board if the CEO had approached it for approving tweets, and the board responded in the negative.“It is therefore stunning to learn that, at the time of filing of the instant motion, Musk had not sought pre-approval for a single one of the numerous tweets about Tesla he published in the months since the court-ordered pre-approval policy went into effect,” the SEC told the judge in a Manhattan court.



Last month, The Securities and Exchange Commission has asked a judge to hold Elon Musk in contempt for violating a deal the regulator struck with the Tesla chief executive last year, which requires him to get the approval of the Tesla board of directors before tweeting anything that could “be material to investors.”The tweet that prompted the SEC move said that Tesla will manufacture half a million cars this year. The tweet, however, was quickly followed by another one, clarifying that he “Meant to say annualized production rate at end of 2019 probably around 500k, ie 10k cars/week. Deliveries for year still estimated to be about 400k.” Related: Oil Rises As OPEC Holds Off On Production Cuts DecisionMusk first drew the attention of the Securities and Exchange Commission last summer when the Tesla CEO said on Twitter he was planning to take the company private and had already secured funding.



It was this phrase, “funding secured”, that alerted the Securities and Exchange Commission, which launched a probe into this claim, prompting Musk to come forward with the revelation that he had for years been in talks with the Saudi sovereign wealth fund to take the company private.Yet the tweet and the following explanation caused changes in the Tesla stock price within two days, which allegedly affected shareholders who bought Tesla stock in the period and prompted the SEC to act.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:“Perfect Storm” Drives Oil Prices HigherTrade Tensions Are Keeping A Lid On Oil PricesWhy This Oil Price Rally Has A Limit

The Canada Pension Plan Investment Board announced it was expanding in U.S. shale gas through a US$3.8-billion joint venture with U.S. independent energy company Williams.The new company will be a pipeline operation and will focus on the Marcellus and Utica shale plays, which are the most prolific in natural gas production.The transactions leading to the establishment of the joint venture involve CPPIB buying a 35-percent stake in Williams’ wholly owned Ohio Valley Midstream pipeline system for US$1.34 billion and Williams buying out its partner Momentum Midstream in another pipeline system, the Utica East Ohio Midstream.



“This joint venture will provide CPPIB additional exposure to the attractive North American natural gas market, aligning with our growing focus on energy transition,” a CPPIB official commented, reflecting the rising interest in investments across the shale patchThis has been particularly true in shale gas-producing regions where drilling has boomed in recent years, but pipeline capacity has been slow to catch up, as Reuters notes in a report on the news.Earlier this month, this industry segment saw another large deal: Equitrans Midstream Corp. bought majority stakes in two pipelines connecting the Marcellus and Utica plays for US$1.03 billion from a Morgan Stanley-managed fund.



Chances are as demand for gas continues to rise and so does production in these prolific plays, we will see more deals of this kind. Unlike oil pipelines, it seems that gas pipeline at least in this part of the United States, are not such a matter of contention between the industry and the environmentalist lobby, which makes the segment ripe for M&A activity as drilling increases.However, there is opposition from landowners in the area whose territory pipeline builders are encroaching on.

The British Columbia government has admitted it has no power to stop the Trans Mountain oil pipeline expansion project but has argued it should have the power to limit the amount of crude oil that flows across its territory from Alberta, the Globe and Mail reports, citing a lawyer for the B.C. government.The argument was heard by the B.C. Court of Appeals where the NDP government of British Columbia took its case against the Trans Mountain project.“(B.C.) accepts it could not stop a federally regulated pipeline … But so too a federal undertaking is not immune from provincial environmental laws,” the lead lawyer for the plaintiffs, Joseph Arvay said. “The likelihood of an event [of an oil spill] is uncertain but carries the possibility of catastrophic impacts.”



The government of Alberta submitted their own statements regarding the issue, with the former asserting that the B.C. government “has repeatedly committed publicly to doing everything it can to prevent the (Trans Mountain) Pipeline Expansion Project from going ahead. It lacks the constitutional authority to do it directly, that is: stop the project or place sufficient roadblocks in its way that it cannot realistically proceed.”The federal government, for its part, has acknowledged the potential adverse environmental impact of an oil spill from the pipeline, but has signaled it will continue to support the Trans Mountain expansion project as a crucial piece of infrastructure to get Albertan heavy to international markets.In its statement for the court, Ottawa struck at the B.C. government for trying to find a loophole in the law to get its way.



It said B.C.’s attempt to restrict the flow of oil raised “a significant concern that the proposed legislation is in fact a legislative Trojan Horse, a bill that has been carefully crafted to appear constitutionally valid so that it might receive a preliminary judicial seal of approval in this reference, but which in substance is an unconstitutional ‘tool’ whose only logical purpose is to limit federally regulated pipelines and railways.”B.C.’s lawyers have insisted that the province has no “axe to grind” with pipelines in general and was motivated by purely environmental concerns. The case has attracted a lot of attention from the legislative profession as it basically comes down to how much power provinces have over infrastructure on their territory as opposed to the federal government, which is by law in charge of said infrastructure.

The UK is on track to import this month its highest volume of liquefied natural gas (LNG) since October 2015, as a wave of new global LNG supply and muted winter demand and low spot prices in Asia are boosting flows of the fuel to Europe.As many as 14 cargoes of LNG are set to arrive in the UK in March, Reuters reports, citing shipping data from Refinitiv Eikon. The surge in LNG imports has pushed down wholesale gas prices in Britain to their lowest in 18 months, according to Reuters data.In addition, UK wholesale gas prices have halved since September last year—a highly unusual occurrence because winter is a peak natural gas demand season in Britain with gas used for heating.  



But the increased flow of LNG has been pushing prices lower.According to British Gas, the UK typically produces enough gas to meet 44 percent of its needs, while it imports 47 percent of its gas via pipelines from Norway and Europe, and another 9 percent in the form of liquefied natural gas (LNG).Yet, over the past six months, LNG supply has accounted for between 15 percent and nearly 30 percent of the gas supply to the UK, Reuters data shows.



Qatar used to be the overwhelmingly dominant LNG supplier to the UK until 2017. But in 2018, Britain imported a lot of U.S. and Russian LNG, which has diminished Qatar’s market share, according to Refinitiv Eikon shipping data. In 2017, Qatar’s market share was 87 percent, in 2018 it fell to 39 percent, and it has further dropped to 34 percent so far in 2019.Meanwhile, Asian LNG spot prices plunged to their lowest for this time of the year since 2016. The low LNG prices, however, have already started to spur some demand for May onward, especially from India, trade sources tell Reuters.

Saudi Arabia’s crude oil exports continued to fall at the start of this year after OPEC’s largest producer started to aggressively cut oil supply in December last year to prevent another glut, while the Kingdom signals that further cuts are coming.According to data by the Joint Organisations Data Initiative (JODI) database, which collects self-reported figures from 114 countries, Saudi crude oil exports dropped to 7.254 million bpd in January, down from 7.687 million bpd in December 2018.During the last month of 2018, OPEC’s de facto leader and the cartel’s key ally Russia realized their preemptive production ramp-up to meet a steep Iranian export shortfall would create another glut if they don’t implement another round of cuts, which they did, starting in January.



Saudi Arabia’s crude oil exports plunged by nearly 550,000 bpd to 7.687 million bpd in December, down from a two-year high in November, as the Kingdom started to limit supply after the U.S. granted waivers to eight Iranian customers and the market swung into oversupply. In November, Saudi Arabia’s crude oil exports had jumped by 534,000 bpd month on month to 8.24 million bpd—the highest level in two years after the Saudis boosted supply to the market to offset supply losses from Iran with the return of the U.S. sanctions on Tehran’s oil industry.Related: Oil Rises As OPEC Holds Off On Production Cuts DecisionLast week, Saudi Arabia signaled that it is determined to do ‘whatever it takes’ to rebalance the market and support oil prices by keeping its April crude oil exports at below 7 million bpd, despite requests for more than 7.6 million bpd of Saudi oil from its customers. The lower allocations by Saudi Aramco for April will also mean that the Kingdom’s oil production will be “well below 10 million bpd” in April, a Saudi official told Reuters.



In an interview with the Financial Times in February, Saudi Arabia’s Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said that the Saudis would cut production to around 9.8 million bpd in March, some 500,000 bpd below the commitment in the OPEC+ deal. Al-Falih also said that Saudi Arabia would be cutting its crude oil exports to near 6.9 million bpd this month, slashed from the November high of 8.2 million bpd.  By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Venezuela’s Latest Nightmare: Crude Oil In The Tap WaterWhy This Oil Price Rally Has A LimitOPEC Threatens To Kill U.S. Shale

Venezuela may re-route crude oil that was initially bound for the United States to Russia and other countries, Manuel Quevedo, Venezuela’s Oil Minister and head of the state oil firm PDVSA, said on Monday.Venezuela, under U.S. sanctions on its oil industry since the end of January, will decide where its own crude oil will go, and one of its key goals is to boost ties with Russia, Reuters quoted Quevedo as saying on the sidelines of an OPEC+ panel in Baku, Azerbaijan, today.Russia is the staunchest supporter and ally of Nicolas Maduro’s regime in the political power struggle in the Latin American country sitting on top of the world’s largest oil reserves, while the U.S. and many European nations have recognized Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó as the legitimate interim president. Russia has stood by Maduro for years and has poured billions of U.S. dollars in Venezuela in the form of loans and oil investments.



In another sign of the closer Maduro-Russia ties, Quevedo said in Baku this weekend that he would visit Moscow in early April to open the PDVSA office that Maduro had ordered moved from Lisbon to the Russian capital earlier this month.Related: LNG Sector Dangerously Dependent On Chinese DemandVenezuela’s key oil export terminal Jose is now back in operation, Quevedo also said at the meeting in Baku.



Earlier this month, a massive power outage in Venezuela shut down oil production and processing operations as well as the main oil export terminal.Meanwhile, more than 6 million barrels of Venezuelan crude oil on 11 tankers, initially bound for the U.S., are sitting stranded in the Atlantic due to the U.S. sanctions, Reuters reported last week. PDVSA is now asking for prepayment for oil shipments, but the U.S. firms are not allowed to pay PDVSA because of the sanctions; instead they are directed to deposit the payments in escrow accounts to which the Venezuelan opposition, not Maduro’s regime, has access.This situation has resulted in U.S. refiners Valero Energy and Citgo, the U.S. unit of PDVSA, proposing to return crude oil loaded before the sanctions were imposed, while Chevron has unsuccessfully tried to legally pay for oil it had contracted to buy, Reuters reported, citing an internal document of the Venezuelan state oil firm it had seen.

Elon Musk is not giving up on the potentially huge but largely undeveloped electric vehicle (EV) market in India, saying that he ‘would love’ Tesla to be there this year or next.Replying to a Twitter follower, Musk has recently said “Would love to be there this year. If not, definitely next!,” adding a couple of heart emoticons for India.Tesla has not started making electric vehicles in India yet because of some challenging government regulations, Musk said in May last year.Replying to a user commenting on a map of Tesla Superchargers that Musk had tweeted, the EV maker’s chief executive wrote last May:



“Would love to be in India. Some challenging government regulations, unfortunately.”In May 2017, Musk tweeted, “Maybe I’m misinformed, but I was told that 30% of parts must be locally sourced and the supply doesn’t yet exist in India to support that.”A month later, in June, Tesla’s CEO said that he was “In discussions with the government of India requesting temporary relief on import penalties/restrictions until a local factory is built.”Although India and China are similarly sized with regards to their huge populations, India is lagging far behind China in terms of passenger EV adoption, with just 6,000 passenger EVs, compared to China’s 1.35 million passenger EVs, according to data from Bloomberg NEF.



In August last year, Bloomberg NEF (BNEF) analysts said that India was more focused on electrifying public transport, taxis, and three-wheelers, which comes at the expense of private passenger EVs.“We remain optimistic on India’s e-bus market, but do not expect large numbers of passenger EVs to be sold until the latter half of the 2020s,” BNEF analysts said.India’s biggest electrification drive in transportation is taking place in the three-wheeled e-rickshaws which can maneuver in the crowded streets, Bloomberg’s Jill Ward and Anindya Upadhyay wrote in October last year. India has 1.5 million e-rickshaws—more than the total number of passenger EVs in China, they found.  By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:How The Californian Oil Boom DiedWhy This Oil Price Rally Has A LimitIEA Warns Of Looming Oil Market Deficit

Chinese refiners are expected to process more than 13 million barrels of crude oil per day for the first time ever in the third quarter this year, a Reuters survey of 20 refiners showed on Monday.The rise in processing rates at China’s refineries is also expected to result in a worsening glut of refined oil products on the domestic market, and some refiners may opt to reduce run rates or focus on chemicals in order to avoid direct competition in transportation fuels, which will further dampen refining margins in China and the region.In the first two months of 2019, Chinese refineries processed 102.49 million tons of crude oil, or 12.68 million bpd—the highest on record and a 6.1-percent increase compared to the same period last year, according to China’s customs data.



Most of the processed crude came from imports of crude oil, which continued to increase this year compared to the same months of 2018. In February, China imported 39.22 million tons of crude, or 10.23 million bpd, up 21.6 percent on the year. In January, imports stood at 42.6 million tons or 10.03 million bpd, up 4.8 percent on the year.Going forward, at least eight refineries in China will enter maintenance or overhauls in the second quarter, which will result in lower processing rates in April-June, according to the Reuters survey and calculations.But then in Q3, a total of 800,000 bpd in new refining capacity from two large refineries is expected to come online, likely boosting the collective Chinese refineries’ processing rate to a new record of more than 13 million bpd, but dragging down margins as it would exacerbate an already large transportation fuel oversupply.



Zhejiang Petrochemical and Hengli Petrochemicals are each expected to have their respective 400,000-bpd refineries up and running at full capacity by the end of the third quarter this year, according to the Reuters survey.

Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani officially launched four new development phases at the giant South Pars offshore gas field, which will add 110 million cubic meters to the daily output of the field. The expansion cost US$11 billion, Reuters reports.Last week, Petroleum Minister Bijan Zanganeh said South Pars will produce from 27 phases of development within a year. He added production from the field—the world’s largest—would reach more than 750 million cubic meters later this year. Iran’s total to date stands at 841 million cubic meters daily, which should rise to 880 million cubic meters daily by next March and 950 million cubic meters daily in the year after that.South Pars was supposed to be developed by French Total and Chinese CNPC in partnership with the local national oil company. However, when U.S. sanctions snapped back last November, Total was forced to retreat and quit the project. At the time, expectations were that CNPC would take over its 50.1-percent share in the project and continue working on it on its own. However, the Chinese state giant also has substantial exposure to the U.S. banking system, which effectively put a stop to work on Phase 11.



Now, Zanganeh says, Iran is in talks with the Chinese company to resume work on the project as China is a major destination for Iranian gas.Related: How The Californian Oil Boom DiedThe South Pars field is the biggest gas deposit in the world, shared by Iran and Qatar. The 20-year development project, of which Total and CNPC were a part of, envisaged bringing gas production from the field to 2 billion cu ft of gas daily. Now, Iran is going it alone, apparently, and planning more exports.First, however, it needs to settle an export dispute with Pakistan, one of the world’s fastest-growing gas markets.



“As far as gas exports to Pakistan are concerned, legally speaking, we are in the position of claimant, and they also have political excuses, saying they are under pressure from the UAE and Saudi Arabia, but we have a valid contract; Pakistan cannot find any gas cheaper than Iran’s,” Zanganeh said this weekend.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Why This Oil Price Rally Has A LimitOPEC Threatens To Kill U.S. ShaleIEA Warns Of Looming Oil Market Deficit

Kazakhstan will shut down production at its giant Kashagan field to comply with production cuts agreed by OPEC and its partners in December.S&P Global Platts quoted the country’s energy minister, Kanat Bozumbayev, as saying ""Output there is currently between 300,000 and 350,000 b/d, so it will be a significant cut, almost 200,000 b/d. We expect that in April and May we will have a low output level, then in June it will pick up and so our average output for the six months will be less than 1.8 million b/d.""



A cut of 200,000 bpd would be equal to what Russia agreed to remove from its daily production rate as part of the deal with OPEC. It is also a substantial portion of Kazakhstan’s overall production, which in February stood at 1.893 million bpd.Kashagan is one of the world’s largest offshore oil fields, with reserves of 13 billion barrels of crude and in-place resources of as much as 38 billion barrels. Its development has been challenging, mainly because of climatic and geological peculiarities, and because of cost overruns that saw the final budget swell more than double on the initial US$20 billion to US$50 billion, but the field eventually came online in 2013. There have been plans to bring the field’s production rate to half a million barrels daily.



It’s worth noting Kazakhstan’s minister apparently does not envisage a future in which the OPEC+ cuts stretch for longer than six months while his Saudi counterpart said at the meeting in Baku that they might need to be extended not just beyond April but beyond June as well.OPEC and its partners led by Russia agreed to cut 1.2 million bpd from global supply to push prices higher. However, rising U.S. production has interfered with their plans for a quick rise in prices. In fact, now Saudi Arabia’s Khalid al-Falih is saying the world’s supplies of crude are rising despite U.S. sanctions against Venezuela and Iran, which is why the cuts may have to be extended.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:The Billionaires Battling It Out Over BiofuelPakistan Aims To Become A Natural Gas HotspotThe Small Asian Nation With Big LNG Plans

Royal Dutch Shell has set its first-ever short-term goals to cut the carbon footprint of its operations and product sales as the oil and gas industry is under intense investor and shareholder pressure to address to climate change.In its annual report published on Thursday, Shell said that in early 2019, it had decided to set a “Net Carbon Footprint target” for 2021 to lower its carbon footprint by 2-3 percent compared to the 2016 Net Carbon Footprint of 79 grams of CO2 equivalent per megajoule. Shell’s approach to the Net Carbon Footprint targets includes not only emissions directly from Shell operations, such as extraction, transportation, and processing of raw materials, and transportation of products, but also emissions generated by third parties who supply energy to Shell for production, and Shell’s customers’ emissions from their use of the energy products that the company sells.



In December last year, in an industry first, Shell said that it plans to set short-term targets for reducing the net carbon footprint of the energy products it sells, and to link those targets with executive remuneration.“Building public trust this year also involved strengthening our public commitment to the Paris Agreement on climate change. In our joint statement with institutional investors on behalf of Climate Action 100+, we have committed to operationalise our ambition of around 50% Net Carbon Footprint reduction by 2050, through the setting of short-term targets which will be linked to executive remuneration,” Shell said in its annual report.Related: Is A Crisis Looming For Canadian Oil?“Shell are showing progress in answering the call from investors with $33 trillion in assets to make their business consistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement,” said Stephanie Pfeifer, a member of the global Climate Action 100+ steering committee and CEO at the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change (IIGCC).



“Setting the first interim target early and linking it to executive remuneration demonstrates commitment to deliver on the agreement reached with investors as part of Climate Action 100+. We look forward to further steps from both Shell and others in the sector,” Pfeifer said.  By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:IEA Warns Of Looming Oil Market DeficitOil Prices Surge To Multi-Month HighsOil Prices Shrug As Rig Count Continues To Fall

Imperial Oil said on Friday that it had slowed down the development of its Aspen oil sands project, due to the market uncertainty that the mandatory production cuts in Alberta have created.Imperial Oil, alongside Suncor Energy and Husky Energy, has opposed the cuts across the board and those companies—mostly with investments in downstream operations that had benefited from the very low prices of refinery feedstocks—continue to hold the view that the Alberta government has been wrong in intervening on the free market.“Imperial’s view remains that free markets work and intervention sends a negative message to investors about doing business in Alberta and Canada. The company remains concerned about the unintended consequences of the government’s decision to manipulate prices, including the negative impact on rail economics,” Imperial Oil said in today’s statement announcing the delaying of the Aspen project.The company decided to proceed with the development of the project in November last year, a month before the Alberta government mandated oil production cuts in its attempt to lift the then-very low Canadian heavy oil prices.



The Aspen project northeast of Fort McMurray, Alberta, will involve an investment of US$1.95 billion (C$2.6 billion) and is expected to produce around 75,000 barrels of bitumen per day. In November, Imperial planned construction to begin in the fourth quarter of 2018 and the project to start up in 2022.In light of the Alberta production cuts, “the slowdown in project execution, given the limited winter drilling and site preparation season, will likely result in a delay of at least one year,” Imperial said today.Related: The EIA Cuts U.S. Oil Output Projections“[W]e cannot invest billions of dollars on behalf of our shareholders given the uncertainty in the current business environment,” Imperial chairman, president and CEO Rich Kruger said in the statement.“The decision to return to planned project activity levels will depend on factors such as any subsequent government actions related to curtailment and our confidence in general market conditions,” Kruger added.



On Imperial’s Q4 earnings call in early February, Kruger said:“So in short, with a stroke of a pen, the government began picking winners and losers. We think this action is unfair, anticompetitive and not representative of free economy in a modern democracy.”By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Is A Crisis Looming For Canadian Oil?IEA Warns Of Looming Oil Market DeficitOil Prices Surge To Multi-Month Highs

Canada’s federal government is funding three clean technology projects in Alberta’s oil and gas industry, allocating resources to two companies to help them develop processes to curb emissions at their operations.On Thursday, Canada’s Minister of Natural Resources Amarjeet Sohi announced federal investments of a total of US$54.2 million (C$72.3 million) to Alberta companies Canadian Natural Resources Limited and Titanium Corporation Inc for projects designed to reduce the emissions from oil sands operations.The federal government will fund two projects of Canadian Natural Resources. The first project is for developing an in-pit extraction process that separates oil sands ore into solids, bitumen, and water at the Horizon Oil Sands mine site, thus reducing the number of diesel trucks and the amount of power needed. The other funding to Canadian Natural Resources is for a new steam turbine generator technology that will help produce power for its facilities at the Athabasca Oil Sands Project while reducing emissions. Titanium Corporation will get funding for technology designed to remediate oil sands tailings at Canadian Natural’s Horizon Oil Sands site.



“Canadian Natural, and Canada’s oil and natural gas sector, recognize the need to reduce GHG emission intensities, and we have been able to leverage technology and Canadian ingenuity to deliver significant results,” Canadian Natural’s President Tim McKay said in a statement.While the federal government is funding clean technology at Alberta’s oil sands, Alberta and its oil producers continue their fight for improved market access for their product—new pipelines that would increase the takeaway capacity of Alberta’s oil.Also on Thursday, the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP) said in a new report that Canada’s abundance of natural resources can help the country to achieve “significant domestic and global benefits: if we resolve current market access challenges.”



The shortage of oil pipelines and liquefied natural gas (LNG) infrastructure “are crippling our ability to compete for global market share,” CAPP said.“Global energy demand is growing,” CAPP president and CEO Tim McMillan said. “However, Canada is losing the race to claim a piece of the high-growth market overseas. Without new pipelines, Canada’s oil and natural gas industry can’t compete for a share of the global market,” McMillan noted.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:The Billionaires Battling It Out Over BiofuelPakistan Aims To Become A Natural Gas HotspotThe Small Asian Nation With Big LNG Plans

Canada’s Minister of Fisheries, Oceans and the Canadian Coast Guard, Sean Casey, will make an important announcement on March 18th concerning funding provided to international organizations to protect Canadian waters from oil spills, the Canadian federal government said on Friday. The announcement will take place in Boston, Massachusetts, where Casey will be accompanied by the Consul General of Canada in Boston, David Alward, and Dr. Collin Ward, Assistant Scientist, Marine Chemistry and Geochemistry, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, the government said in a media advisory.Canada has a so-called Marine Oil Spill Preparedness and Response Regime, which has been in place since 1995 and relies on partnership between the government and industry. Transport Canada is the lead federal regulatory agency responsible for the regime and sets the guidelines and regulatory structure for the preparedness and response to marine oil spills.



The regime’s guiding principles include effective and responsive legislation; potential polluters pay for preparedness; polluter pays for reasonable response costs; based on partnership with industry; comprehensive contingency plans; and mutual agreements with neighbors.Under Canada’s US$1.1 billion (C$1.5 billion) Oceans Protection Plan, more than US$34 million (C$45 million) is invested in collaborative research initiatives expected to lead to collaboration among oil spill researchers across Canada and around the world.When British Columbia launched its improved oil spill response program as part of its efforts to safeguard its environment against accidents from the expanded Trans Mountain pipeline, the government officials in charge must have missed a little detail: the program was to be funded by toll payments from the pipeline.



The program’s future is uncertain, after Canada’s Federal Court of Appeal suspended the project last year, citing numerous flaws in the National Energy Board’s review of the expansion that the federal government should not have used as basis for its approval of Trans Mountain.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:The Small Asian Nation With Big LNG PlansThe Khashoggi Killing Is Driving Saudi Oil DiversificationHow The Californian Oil Boom Died

The UK’s crude oil loadings remained below 800,000 bpd for the third month in a row in February, while authorities expect Britain’s crude oil production to decline through at least 2024, Fotios Katsoulas, Liquid Bulk Principal Analyst, Maritime & Trade at IHS Markit, said on Friday.In February, the Far East was among the top destinations for UK crude oil, with UK crude flows significantly rising to 265,000 bpd, up from 139,000 bpd in January, Katsoulas said.UK crude flows to northwest Europe and the Mediterranean, on the other hand, dropped significantly, providing more space for China, according to IHS Markit’s analyst.



The UK faces two major headwinds for its crude oil production—the continued uncertainty around Brexit (and the possibility of a really disorderly one), and a trend of declining oil production through 2024.Crude oil production in the UK will decline this year to 940,000 bpd from last year’s 980,000 bpd, the Oil and Gas Authority said in a new report, adding that output would continue to decline in the next five years as well, reaching 760,000 bpd in 2024.Interestingly enough, the decline in production will come just a year after output—including crude oil and natural gas liquids—hit a seven-year high of 1.09 million bpd, thanks, the OGA said, to the launch of 30 new fields since 2015 along with better asset integrity and more enhanced oil recovery projects at legacy fields.



Related: How The Californian Oil Boom DiedStill, despite the negative trend, the Oil and Gas Authority has updated its long-term production projection to 2050. Now, the authority expects the cumulative output of oil and gas for the period between 2015 and 2050 to be 3.9 billion barrels of oil equivalent higher than it projected in March 2015 and 200 million barrels of oil equivalent higher than OGA’s September 2018 projection.A “disorderly Brexit” and trade disputes are two of the main factors that could lead to slower international trade and oil demand growth, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said in its Oil 2019 report published earlier this week.   By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:The EIA Cuts U.S. Oil Output ProjectionsIs A Crisis Looming For Canadian Oil?IEA Warns Of Looming Oil Market Deficit

LNG Canada may end up with a total capacity of 28 million tons of the fuel annually, to be built in two phases, the project’s chief executive told Reuters on the sidelines of CERAWeek.“We want to take FID on phase 2 before LNG flows from phase 1. (The partners) want to have some insight overall on the project before FID,” Andy Calitz said. First LNG from phase one is scheduled to start flowing in 2025.The five companies behind the US$31 billion (C$40 billion) LNG Canada project announced their final investment decision on the project last October, ending months of uncertainty and worry that the large-scale project could become the second failed LNG initiative in British Columbia after Petronas quit its proposed Pacific North West project on depressed LNG prices.



LNG Canada is a project of Shell, with a 40-percent stake, Malaysia’s Petronas with 25 percent, PetroChina with 15 percent, Mitsubishi with 15 percent, and South Korea’s Kogas with 5 percent.The facility, which is expected to become operational before 2025, will initially have two liquefaction trains, each with a capacity of 6.5 million tons of LNG with the prospect of adding another two trains at a later stage, the consortium said at the time. Now, it looks like the prospects for LNG demand look bright enough to boost this and finalize the decision to do this early on.Related: U.S. Aims To Bring Iran Oil Exports Below 1 Million Bpd



Yet there are problems around the project despite the approval of the British Columbia government, and these problems have to do with environmentalist and indigenous opposition. Most recently, LNG Canada made headlines when work on the pipeline that would feed natural gas to the B.C. coast liquefaction facility was halted after a couple of indigenous artifacts were found at the construction site.The artifacts, according to the B.C. energy regulator, did not originate in the place where they were found.

Tesla last night unveiled the latest member of its passenger vehicle family, the Model Y crossover SUV, which sports a range of up to 300 miles, seats seven, and has a price tag of US$47,000. Chief executive Elon Musk has predicted the model will sell better than the other three combined.Deliveries of this long-range base-model version of the car will begin in the fall of 2020, but the car is available to pre-order, of course, with a deposit of US$2,500. A cheaper, shorter-range, version of the Model Y, at US$39,000 will be made available to customers in the spring of 2021. Its battery would have the capacity to last for 230 miles.



There will also be a more expensive version of the Model Y, The Verge reported, with a price tag of US$51,000 that will feature an all-wheel drive and a dual motor. A third, even more expensive version will be a performance Model Y that will sell for US$60,000. Both of these will be made available to customers at the same time as the base model.MarketWatch’s Claudia Assis noted in a report on the release that the Model Y is a smaller more affordable version of the Model X, which Musk had repeatedly blamed for various delays, and a model Musk had promised to bring to market at some point.



Tesla has not yet said where it will build the Model Y but it will have a lot of common components with the Model 3, which will enable the streamlining of Tesla’s production platform, Assis said. However, some are worried the new car will pressure demand for what was supposed to be Tesla’s flagship car, the Model 3.Time will tell if this worry has any grounds but it’s worth recalling that the Model 3 became the most sold electric car in the world last year: the first full-year of production for the car. Total sales came in at 138,000, versus 92,000 for Chinese BAIC and 85,000 for Nissan Leaf.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:The Small Asian Nation With Big LNG PlansThe Khashoggi Killing Is Driving Saudi Oil DiversificationHow The Californian Oil Boom Died

San Francisco and Oakland have approached a federal appeals court with a request to reinstate their lawsuits against five Big Oil companies, which a U.S. District Judge dismissed last year.NBC reports the two municipalities had also asked the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of San Francisco to return the lawsuits on their own turf, to the San Francisco Superior Court and the Alameda County Superior Court, where the lawsuits were filed originally.



San Francisco and Oakland are suing Chevron, Exxon, Shell, BP, and ConocoPhillips for selling oil products despite their knowledge of the effect these products had on the environment.""Defendants have known for decades that the continued burning of fossil fuels would increase global temperatures and cause devastating impacts on coastal communities like Oakland and San Francisco. Yet they continued to wrongfully promote the increased, unrestricted use of their products,"" the attorneys of the two plaintiffs wrote in a brief.



The five companies’ stance was that control over the production of oil and gas and carbon emissions from the industry is the prerogative of environmental regulators and not courts. They argued the case should be dismissed, which is exactly what happened eventually.Yet, the Big Oil defendants have also argued the environmental damage the two cities’ authorities claim they have sustained is “speculative”, involving billions of people using oil and gas as well as long environmental processes.Another anti-Big Oil case against the same five companies was dismissed in New York City as well, a month after the SF/Oakland case dismissal. “Climate change is a fact of life, as is not contested by Defendants,” the Manhattan judge wrote in his ruling. “But the serious problems caused thereby are not for the judiciary to ameliorate. Global warming and solutions thereto must be addressed by the two other branches of government.”By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Asian LNG Prices Continue To TumbleOil Falls After EIA Reports Large Crude BuildBezos, Bloomberg And Gates Back Revolutionary Exploration Tech

The U.S. sanctions on Venezuela’s oil industry have not had a significant impact on the operations of the largest U.S. refiner Marathon Petroleum Corp, chairman and chief executive officer Gary Heminger said at IHS Markit’s CERAWeek conference in Houston.According to Heminger, Marathon Petroleum had seen sanctions coming a long time ago and Venezuelan crude oil was a small percentage of the millions of barrels of oil the company buys every day, the Houston Chronicle reports.Most of the U.S. refiners have been reducing purchases of Venezuelan oil for some time, Heminger noted.



On the other hand, Venezuela’s crude oil exports have been plunging over the past two years because of its plummeting production and also because part of Venezuelan oil is being shipped to countries like Russia and China as a repayment for loans that Moscow and Beijing have extended to Venezuela or its state oil firm PDVSA.  Similar sweeping sanctions against Venezuela would have had a significant impact five years ago, but this is not the case today, the Houston Chronicle quoted Heminger as saying at the conference.Shortly after the U.S. imposed the sanctions on Venezuela at the end of January, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) said that the sanctions were unlikely to have a significant impact on the refinery runs of the U.S. refiners. U.S. imports of crude oil from Venezuela have been falling in recent years, and U.S. refiners have been replacing heavy crude from Venezuela with heavy crude grades from other sources, the EIA said.



Commenting on the new sulfur content regulations by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) as of January 1, 2020, Marathon Petroleum’s Heminger said that the U.S. refining industry is fully prepared for the processing of more low-sulfur fuels.Torbjörn Törnqvist, CEO at trading house Gunvor, said in October last year that the new rules would surely create an initial confusion, but in the end the big overall winner from IMO will be the United States.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Pakistan Aims To Become A Natural Gas HotspotThe Small Asian Nation With Big LNG PlansThe Khashoggi Killing Is Driving Saudi Oil Diversification

Norway’s government is proposing to expand the area that will be offered for oil and gas exploration in the 2019 licensing round of acreage in mature areas, Petroleum and Energy Minister Kjell-Børge Freiberg said on Thursday.Norway plans to include a total of 90 new blocks in the so-called APA annual licensing round this year, including 48 blocks in the Barents Sea, 37 blocks in the Norwegian Sea, and five blocks in the North Sea, Freiberg said.   “It’s important to maintain the positive development in exploration activity in the Barents Sea. I hope this will lead to robust field development solutions and increased value creation in the north,” Reuters quoted Freiberg as saying in a statement.There has been opposition to the extension of the acreage under the APA licensing round from politicians of the opposition and from environmentalists, who have argued that those licensing rounds with additional blocks are being used to expand exploration to beyond the scope of those rounds—that is mature and well-explored areas.  



In the 2018 APA licensing round, Norway awarded 83 production licenses—a record number of awards for such rounds.“53 years after the first licensing round, this new record confirms the industry’s belief in continued value creation and activity in Norway,” Freiberg said in January this year, when he announced the new licenses and the 33 different companies that were awarded ownership interests.Related: Two Largest Oil Price Benchmarks Are Set To DivergeNorway’s oil production is expected to drop this year to its lowest level since 1988, but to recover afterwards thanks to two large developments.



Production is expected to jump in 2020 through 2023, thanks to the start up in late 2019 of Johan Sverdrup—the North Sea giant, as operator Equinor calls it.But after Johan Sverdrup and after Johan Castberg in the Barents Sea scheduled for first oil in 2022, Norway doesn’t have major oil discoveries and projects to sustain its oil production after the middle of the 2020s.The Norwegian Petroleum Directorate (NPD) started warning last year that from the mid-2020s onward, production offshore Norway will start to decline “so making new and large discoveries quickly is necessary for maintaining production at the same level from the mid-2020s.”  By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Oil Prices Rise As Saudis Curb ExportsAnalysts: Permian Oil Output Set To Double By 2023Oil Prices Jump As Saudis Promise To Do ""Whatever It Takes""

The oil and gas sector is facing a stiff competition in attracting young talent in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) because Millennials and Generation Zs are most interested in jobs in an industry associated with new technologies, according to the “Workforce of the Future” survey commissioned by the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC).A total of 44 percent of the polled 3,075 young STEM talent across 10 countries said that they would be interested in pursuing a career in oil and gas, compared to 77 percent in the technology sector, 58 percent in life sciences and pharmaceuticals, and 57 percent in healthcare, for example.The survey of young STEM talent in the United States, Canada, the UK, France, Russia, China, India, Japan, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE, showed that interest in a career in oil and gas is nearly on par with marketing and advertising (48 percent), hospitality (47 percent), transport/logistics (46 percent) and retail (41 percent).



The top five drivers for Millennials and Gen Zs career picks are “salary,” “work-life balance,” “job stability,” “on-the-job fulfilment,” and “a good work environment,” the survey showed.The top three positive associations of the oil and gas sector among the 15-35 year-old STEM talent were “the industry pays well,” “the industry is crucial for their country’s economy and development,” and it is “an industry we couldn’t live without.”It comes as no surprise that Millennials and Gen Zs showed the highest interest in a career path in industries which they believe will be the most impacted by new technologies. Globally, 42 percent of the young talent polled said that new technologies would have a ‘major impact’ on the oil and gas industry, well below those who associate new technologies with a major impact in the technology industry—73 percent.



Nearly 3 in 4, or 72 percent, believe that new technologies will have an overall impact on the oil and gas sector, compared to 9 out of 10 for the technology sector.Millennials and Gen Zs are divided, however, on whether oil and gas is an industry of the past or of the future—44 percent say it is an industry of the past, while 45 percent reckon it is of the future.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:The EIA Cuts U.S. Oil Output ProjectionsIs A Crisis Looming For Canadian Oil?The Billionaires Battling It Out Over Biofuel

Local official Kiamars Hajizadeh said that the explosion was caused by a gas leakage from the pipeline, according to the semiofficial ISNA news agency.At least four people, including one child and a woman, were killed and five others were wounded, Hajizadeh added.State television reported that five vehicles in the area had caught fire following the explosion, adding that firefighters and ambulances had been dispatched to the area.



The semiofficial Fars news agency quoted the fire chief in Ahvaz, Ali Torabpour, as saying that a bus, a truck, and a private car had caught fire.A fire brigade spokesman told ISNA that emergency crew members were able to extinguish the fire, but the exact number of people killed or injured remained unclear.Iran has an aging infrastructure, which it has struggled to maintain in working order through years of Western sanctions. Safety measures are also poorly enforced in Iran.In August 2018, a gas explosion in a sports complex in Tehran killed at least three workers.By RFE/RLMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:The Billionaires Battling It Out Over BiofuelPakistan Aims To Become A Natural Gas HotspotThe Small Asian Nation With Big LNG Plans

Iraq’s State Oil Marketing Organization (SOMO) is looking to expand its crude oil trading activities with more spot sales and with opening offices outside Iraq, the director of SOMO’s crude oil and gas marketing division, Ali Nazar Faeq Al-Shatari, said at the at the S&P Global Platts Asian Refining Summit on Thursday.The state oil marketing company of OPEC’s second-largest producer plans to begin the opening of offices abroad with Singapore, S&P Global Platts quoted Al-Shatari as saying during the conference.According to industry and trading sources who spoke to Reuters this week, SOMO has moved to scrap two joint ventures for trading as it aims to boost its crude oil sales on its own and get the trading revenues for itself.



At the end of last year SOMO also clamped down on the previously widespread re-selling of its crude oil cargoes, which it had always banned, although that ban had been largely ignored.According to Reuters, now the Iraqi state oil marketing company is also emboldened to trade the Iraqi crude on its own as the market for sour and heavy crude grades is tightening amid OPEC’s cuts and the U.S. sanctions on Iran and Venezuela.Iraq also aims to sell more of its oil on the prized Asian markets, and in November it allocated 67 percent of its 2019 oil sales to Asia. Iraq has raised the share of its crude oil shipped to Asia to 67 percent for 2019, from around 60 percent earlier in 2018.



Middle Eastern oil producers have been keen to get more revenues from trading their own oil.In April last year, the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) said that it was establishing a new trading unit to “introduce and manage non-speculative trading to further maximize value from every barrel of crude oil and refined product that is produced and marketed by the company.”By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Is This A Precursor For Peak Oil Demand?Analysts: Permian Oil Output Set To Double By 2023Is A Crisis Looming For Canadian Oil?

Another large field, Leviathan, is close to completion, with first gas flowing into the market in late 2019, according to a November 2018 Reuters report.



The Tamar field contains an estimated 281 billion cu m of natural gas and some 13 million barrels of condensate, according to field operator Delek Group. Delek partners on Tamar’s development with Noble Energy, which holds a 25-percent stake.Delek and Noble Energy are also the lead partners on the Leviathan project, which Steinitz earlier this year called “the greatest natural treasure that has been discovered in Israel.” The field holds about 535 billion cu m of natural gas as well as 34.1 million barrels of condensate.Israel has grand ambitions in the gas industry thanks to these discoveries and has been eager to tap more reserves. It has already struck a sizeable gas export deal with an Egyptian firm, but it may just be the start of its growth as a regional factor to reckon with in gas.



This may put Exxon in an interesting position with its partners from the Arab countries, but the risk is relatively small: local oil and gas producers have benefited from the know-how supplied by Exxon and the other Big Oil majors for long enough to risk losing it.However, there is no certainty there will be another Leviathan-sized discovery any time soon. The 2017 oil and gas block tender that Tel Aviv held was disappointing and hopes are now that the next round, to cover 19 blocks, will have better results.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Is A Crisis Looming For Canadian Oil?The Small Asian Nation With Big LNG PlansPakistan Aims To Become A Natural Gas Hotspot

India’s Reliance Industries has suspended shipments of much-needed diluents to Venezuela’s PDVSA and will not resume them until U.S. sanctions against the South American country are not lifted.Reuters quoted a statement by the company as saying Reliance has also not raised the amount of oil it buys from PDVSA under a 2012 contract that stipulated it would buy between 300,000 and 400,000 bpd of Venezuelan crude for a period of 15 years. However, Reuters calculations suggest that Reliance has been importing less than 300,000 bpd from Venezuela since 2018.Reliance was supplying diluents necessary to make the extra heavy Venezuelan crude fluid enough to be loaded on tankers from its U.S. subsidiary. Before the January sanctions, the country imported an average 100,000 bpd of naphtha to use as diluent at a naphtha/crude rate of 1:4. Most of these imports came from the United States.



Now Washington is tightening the noose, and companies that do business both in the United States and in Venezuela are heeding its instruction to stop the latter.Reliance is India’s largest refiner and operator of the biggest refining complex in the country. It is also part of a sprawling global conglomerate that has close ties to the U.S. financial system hence its precarious position with regard to the Venezuelan sanctions.“Since the U.S. government imposed sanctions on the government of Venezuela in late January 2019, Reliance Industries Ltd has been in close contact with representatives from the U.S. State Department to ensure full compliance,” the company told Reuters.



Meanwhile, PDVSA’s U.S. business, Citgo, has got a new board of directors appointed by the self-declared interim president of Venezuela, opposition leader Juan Guaido with the assistance of the United States, which is seeking to replace Nicolas Maduro with Guaido before new elections are held in the embattled country.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:The Small Asian Nation With Big LNG PlansPakistan Aims To Become A Natural Gas HotspotVenezuela’s Latest Nightmare: Crude Oil In The Tap Water

Italy’s oil and gas major Eni said on Wednesday that it had made a major oil discovery in Angola’s deepwater in a find that could help the African OPEC producer to reverse the recent decline in oil production.Eni struck oil in Block 15/06 in the Agogo exploration prospect and estimates that the discovery contains 450-650 million barrels of light oil in place with further upside.The data acquired from the well indicates a production capacity of more than 20,000 bpd, Eni said, noting that this was the third commercial discovery in Block 15/06. Now Eni and its joint venture partners in the block, Sonangol P&P and SSI Fifteen Limited, will work to appraise the discovery and begin studies to fast track its development.Eni, a key player in Africa and in Angola, currently produces around 155,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in Angola.



The African country, however, has been struggling in recent years to offset a decline in production as many fields mature.After the oil price crash of 2014, Angola’s economy had suffered from the low oil prices and the country had also been struggling to attract international investments in its deepwater higher-breakeven oil resources.Last year, Angola introduced several new measures to try to boost its oil production and its attractiveness for international investment. President Joao Lourenco signed in the summer of 2018 a decree to create an agency that would sell and manage oil blocks instead of state oil firm Sonangol.Related: The EIA Cuts U.S. Oil Output Projections



Earlier in 2018, Angola halved the tax rates on the development of oil discoveries with fewer than 300 million barrels of reserves. Angola cut the petroleum production tax on so-called marginal fields—those with below 300 million barrels of reserves—to 10 percent from the typical 20 percent tax. The tax reforms also halved the petroleum income tax on marginal fields to 25 percent from 50 percent.According to OPEC’s figures, Angola’s crude oil production in January 2019 averaged 1.416 million bpd, down by 75,000 bpd compared to December 2018, despite the fact that under the new OPEC+ deal, Angola’s cap is at 1.481 million bpd—higher than its production in January.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Is A Crisis Looming For Canadian Oil?The Billionaires Battling It Out Over BiofuelThe Small Asian Nation With Big LNG Plans

Mexico’s President Andrés Manuel López Obrador does not rule out a possible listing of the ailing state oil firm Pemex on the local market.Pemex could also issue a new bond, Reuters quoted López Obrador as saying on Wednesday. However, such moves to raise funds for the indebted oil company are not necessary, the president noted.Last month, Mexican officials said that the country would support Pemex by injecting US$3.6 billion into the debt-laden firm, including by refinancing debt and cutting taxes.The Mexican government, however, will not take on new debt for Pemex, Reuters quoted officials as saying in mid-February.



The Mexican state oil firm has a total of US$106 billion in financial debt.Mexico’s left-wing President López Obrador—in office since December 1—wants a greater role for Pemex in reversing the downward trend in Mexican oil production.Pemex’s crude oil production continues to decline—according to Pemex figures, its crude oil production averaged 1.813 million bpd in 2018. To compare, Pemex’s crude oil production averaged 2.429 million bpd in 2014, falling to 1.948 million bpd in 2017.López Obrador and Pemex have grand plans for reversing the decline, with the government coming to the rescue of Pemex, as the oil firm itself said in December. A new strategic plan aims to guarantee “the country’s energy security and sovereignty” and targets to raise crude oil production to 2.48 million bpd by the end of this administration’s term in office—the end of 2024.   



In January, Fitch Ratings downgraded Pemex’s ratings to just above investment grade, raising concerns that additional downgrades by Fitch or another rating agency would significantly lift the oil firm’s financing costs while it struggles with a heavy debt load.Earlier this month came a downgrade for Pemex from Standard & Poor’s, due to concerns that the government support may not be enough to heal the company’s finances and reverse the production decline.A day after the S&P downgrade, López Obrador said that the rating agencies’ downgrades were punishing Mexico for the neo-liberal policies of his predecessors in the past three and a half decades.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:The EIA Cuts U.S. Oil Output ProjectionsIs A Crisis Looming For Canadian Oil?The Billionaires Battling It Out Over Biofuel

The constant fire drill that is Tesla's business model continued for yet another day as Elon Musk has now admitted that Tesla made a mistake in announcing it would slash the prices of some of its higher-end vehicles about two weeks ago. This comes days after the company reversed course on its decision to close most of its retail stores. Unfazed by the fact that he’s currently legally feuding with the SEC for tweets regarding business operations at Tesla, Musk again took to the social media site on Tuesday to explain that Tesla ""shouldn’t have offered"" lower prices on Model S and Model X vehicles. Now, Tesla is doing a full ""about face"" and will reinstate its normal prices for its vehicles, with the exception of the base price Model 3, on Monday. ""In retrospect, lower price shouldn’t have been offered. Was done so because come simply couldn't afford it. Prices revert to normal on Monday,"" CEO Elon Musk said in a Tweet - flexing his outstanding planning skills and unmatched business prowess - likely in response to the public's shift in perception to the company's products as less than aspirational status symbols.This abrupt pricing reversal follows reports out of China according to which outraged Tesla owners were protesting the lower prices. In addition, The Daily Mail reported that angry owners had reached out to the company after purchasing Autopilot software for $5000, soon before the prices were discounted.



On February 28, Tesla stated that Autopilot would now cost just $3000, a steep cut from what consumers had originally paid. According to Musk, the price of Autopilot will also ""revert to normal"" on Monday. Musk also said that Tesla was still closing some stores, despite whipsawing reports of closures, freezes, and stores remaining open, over the last two weeks. The company said in a blog days ago: ""As a result of keeping significantly more stores open, Tesla will need to raise vehicle prices by about 3% on average worldwide. In other words, we will only close about half as many stores, but the cost savings are therefore only about half.""Related: Are Semi-Solid State Batteries A Gamechanger?Potential Tesla owners will have a week to place their order before prices rise, so current prices are valid until March 18th. There will be no price increase to the $35,000 Model 3. The price increases will only apply to the more expensive variants of Model 3, as well as Model S and X.Just days earlier, we reported that the company had frozen its previously disclosed plan of closing all of its retail stores.Some retail stores that didn't close were told to stop booking test drives last week. And yet, last week some of them were reportedly prompted to go back to ""business as usual"", despite retail employees not having access to commission and bonuses, resulting in far lower compensation. 



Tesla currently owes lease obligations of $1.6 billion, with $1.1 billion due between now and 2023 the Wall Street Journal reported last week. This includes payments for store leases, galleries and real estate abroad. Robert Taubman, chief executive officer of Taubman Centers Inc., is quoted as saying at the Citi 2019 Global Property CEO conference: ""Tesla is a company with a viable balance sheet that is going to owe a lot of landlords a lot of money.”The decision to close down all of its retail stores and move to an online-only sales model surprised many of the company's employees and investors, with some investors dumping the company's shares as its ""growth"" aura was rapidly deflating. Pro-Tesla blog electrek called the business model changes a ""chaotic situation"", saying it was ""either turning into what feels like an extremely poorly managed, haphazard transition or it is intentionally made that way to push out employees like some are suspecting.""Stated simply, Tesla has now gone back on all of the major business model changes it made just about two weeks ago, further exposing a company that can only be described as in the midst of anarchy.By ZerohedgeMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Is This A Precursor For Peak Oil Demand?Analysts: Permian Oil Output Set To Double By 2023Is A Crisis Looming For Canadian Oil?

North Korea’s nuclear and ballistic missile program remains in tact while the country continues to defy United Nations resolutions with significantly increased illegal ship-to-ship oil and coal transfers, a UN Panel of Experts wrote in an annual report published this week.“These violations render the latest United Nations sanctions ineffective by flouting the caps on the import of petroleum products and crude oil by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea as well as the coal ban, imposed in 2017 by the Security Council in response to the country’s unprecedented nuclear and ballistic missile testing,” the UN report reads.“Global banks and insurance companies continue to unwittingly facilitate payments and provide coverage for vessels involved in ever-larger, multi-million-dollar, illegal ship-to ship transfers of petroleum products, as well as an increasing number of ship-to-ship coal transfers and attempted transshipments,” according to the report.



North Korea is using increasingly advanced and inventive techniques to evade the oil sanctions, including manipulation of vessel AIS transmission systems, physical disguise of tankers, illegal name-changing and other forms of identity fraud, night transfers, and the use of additional vessels for transshipment, the panel of experts said in the report.North Korea also “continues to violate the arms embargo and has attempted to supply small arms and light weapons and other military equipment to Houthi rebels in Yemen, as well as to Libya and the Sudan, via foreign intermediaries, including Syrian arms trafficker Hussein al-Ali in the case of the Houthi rebels,” the UN experts say.Related: Is A Crisis Looming For Canadian Oil?



The United States welcomed the release of the report, saying that it “demonstrates the need for continued vigilance against entities involved in D.P.R.K. sanctions evasion activity.”“International unity in implementing these sanctions continues to hamper the D.P.R.K.’s ability to further its illegal weapons of mass destruction programs and sends the message that the D.P.R.K. will be economically and diplomatically isolated until it denuclearizes,” Robert Palladino, Deputy Spokesperson at the U.S. Department of State, said.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.comOil Prices Jump As Saudis Promise To Do ""Whatever It Takes""Car Companies Close Stores As The “Amazon Effect” Takes HoldOil Prices Inch Higher On Venezuelan Crude Crisis

The U.S. State Department has not warned or notified BP in any way about its role as a substantial shareholder in Russia’s Rosneft after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo accused Rosneft of buying Venezuelan crude despite U.S. sanctions against the country, TASS reports.""I haven’t read it, I haven’t heard it, so I really wouldn’t be able to comment,"" Dudley said on the sidelines of CERAWeek. ""I did not actually hear about that.""Earlier this week, Mike Pompeo accused Rosneft of defying U.S. sanctions against Caracas by continuing to buy crude oil from PDVSA, which is its joint venture partner in a local operation.



The Russian company responded by saying it was engaged in business and not politics, adding its contracts for the purchase of Venezuelan crude were signed before the sanctions against PDVSA were enforced. What’s more, Rosneft said it will evaluate the consequences of Pompeo’s statement, TASS reported yesterday and would defend its rights if it finds these have been adverse.The U.S. Secretary of State on Monday said Russia and Cuba were to blame for the crisis in Venezuela because of their continued support for the Maduro government.“This story is not complete without acknowledging the central role Cuba and Russia have played and continue to play in undermining the democratic dreams of the Venezuelan people and their welfare,” Reuters quoted Pompeo as saying.



“Moscow, like Havana, continues to provide political cover to the Maduro regime, while pressuring countries to disregard the democratic legitimacy of the interim president Guaido,” the U.S. Secretary of State also said.The part of his statement that rattled Rosneft went as follows: “Russia’s state-owned company, Rosneft, continues to purchase crude oil cargoes from PDVSA, Venezuela’s state-owned oil company, in defiance of U.S. sanctions. And, Rosneft’s CEO, Igor Sechin, continues to throw a lifeline to the regime.” By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.comOil Prices Jump As Saudis Promise To Do ""Whatever It Takes""Car Companies Close Stores As The “Amazon Effect” Takes HoldOil Prices Inch Higher On Venezuelan Crude Crisis

The new chairwoman of U.S. refiner Citgo has assured energy industry attendants of the CERAWeek conference that the company is resilient enough to continue operating without any major hiccups.The Houston Chronicle quoted Luisa Palacios as saying ""For the last month (Citgo) has been developing contingency plans because of the risk that could be in place.  I have to say, the flexibility of our refiners has allowed us to adjust to shock in a quite substantial way.”Palacios was appointed chairwoman along with a whole new board of directors by the interim government of Venezuela appointed by opposition leader Juan Guaido. Guaido declared himself interim president this January after slamming the May 2018 elections as illegitimate and calling on the Venezuelan people to take to the streets to try and topple the Maduro government.



Earlier this year, Guaido said he would replace the board of directors not just of Citgo but of PDVSA as well. He did so last month but the original board of the troubled company also stayed in place.Yet Citgo is perhaps more important. While PDVSA has been hit by U.S. sanctions, Citgo is a U.S. incorporated company, whose assets now seem to be at the disposal of the Venezuelan opposition with Washington’s blessing as it increases the pressure on PDVSA and the Maduro government by freezing its assets in the United States and setting up a new account for Venezuelan crude import payments, also to be made available to the Guaido government.,Citgo operated refineries in three states—Texas, Louisiana, and Illinois—and is a major importer of Venezuelan crude. However, according to Palacios, Venezuelan crude makes up about a quarter of its total intake of crude and it can be replaced with oil from other supplier.



""It's a shock, but it's one we're very well placed to weather,"" Palacios said referring to the latest sanctions that more or less cut off Venezuelan crude oil’s access to the Gulf Coast refineries.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Exxon Punished By Wall Street For Spending StrategyKashmir Conflict Has Riyadh On EdgeSaudis Follow Up On Deeper Oil Output Cuts Promise

The oil industry would do well to engage the supporters of the Green New Deal in dialogue, BP’s chief executive Bob Dudley said at this week’s CERAWeek in Texas.“We need to demonstrate that we share the common goal of a low-carbon future and that we are in action toward it,” Dudley said as quoted by Reuters.According to the executive of one of the biggest oil companies with one of the worst environmental reputations, the oil industry needs to engage with Green New Deal proponents as a way of keeping the trust of society.



“Our focus has to be on developing an energy system that is cleaner, better and kinder to the planet,” Dudley said. “But we can only fully play our part if we have the trust of society and the confidence of our shareholders. That means engaging more with the young people who will take to the streets on Friday.”School children from more than 70 countries will skip school on Friday to protest against climate change, demanding more action from governments and businesses.“It means improving the dialogue we have with policymakers around the world, including those behind the Green New Deal,” Dudley said.



The Green New Deal proposed by Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was met with severe criticism by Republican lawmakers but won the praise of the environmentalist lobby. Critics note the price tag of the initiative, which a right-leaning organization estimated at US$93 trillion. However, supporters argue that not doing anything to combat climate change will cost a lot more in the long run.The oil industry is hardly a natural partner for Green New Dealers given its very nature and the focus of the GND on eliminating their products from the energy mix of the United States. Yet the oil industry has already begun making inroads into cleaner energy sources, and a dialogue with the green lobby might not be such a bad idea, even if it is for reputation management purposes.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Is This A Precursor For Peak Oil Demand?Analysts: Permian Oil Output Set To Double By 2023Is A Crisis Looming For Canadian Oil?

At an energy ministry meeting earlier this month, Russia’s oil majors confirmed that they would be sticking to the production cuts that Russia had pledged in the OPEC+ deal, Vagit Alekperov, president and CEO of Russian oil producer Lukoil, said on Tuesday.At the meeting on March 1, Russian oil firms unanimously agreed that they would fulfill their commitments and will cut production as agreed, Russia’s TASS news agency quoted Alekperov as saying on the sidelines of the CERAWeek in Houston today.There was some “special opinion” among the Russian oil companies previously, Alekperov said, reminding reporters of the letter of Rosneft’s chief executive Igor Sechin to Vladimir Putin in which the Rosneft boss criticized the OPEC+ deal.The firms have not discussed production plans for the second half of the year and have decided that they would do so after April, Lukoil’s boss said.



The current OPEC+ deal expires in June.Alexander Dyukov, CEO at Gazpromneft, told TASS that it was too early to draw any conclusions about how the deal would proceed after June. The fate of the agreement should be reviewed after all countries will have achieved their respective reductions, Dyukov said, noting that some countries—including Russia—have not yet reached their quota under the deal.Russia will speed up its oil production cuts this month and plans to reach its share of the OPEC/non-OPEC output reduction by end-March or early April, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said last week.Related: Blackout Shuts Down Venezuela’s Oil Exports

Argentina aims to build new natural gas pipelines and to attract more investment in oil and gas production in the Vaca Muerta shale play in order to increase production and secure transportation and sales for its gas, Energy Minister Gustavo Lopetegui said in Houston.  Domestic gas consumption in Argentina is highly seasonal, with peak demand in the Argentinian winter and significantly lower consumption during the summer months in the southern hemisphere.This seasonality in natural gas demand compares with constantly rising gas production from Argentina’s Vaca Muerta shale play – dubbed the ‘Argentinian Permian’, although its geologic properties have been compared to the Eagle Ford - which is one of the few bright spots in shale gas production outside the United States. 



Vaca Muerta will need investments of between US$5 billion and US$10 billion annually to boost production, Reuters quoted Lopetegui as saying in Houston. Current annual investments in Vaca Muerta are around US$4.3 billion.Argentina also aims to award by the end of September construction contracts for natural gas pipelines from Vaca Muerta to the capital Buenos Aires, the minister said, noting that these construction contracts would be valued at up to US$1.8 billion.“Vaca Muerta must grow harmonically so it is possible to produce, transport and sell without problems,” Lopetegui said, as carried by Reuters.



While Vaca Muerta holds large shale reserves, it has high production costs which have so far hampered a U.S.-style shale revolution in Argentina.According to Lopetegui, some producers in Vaca Muerta have recently managed to reduce production costs significantly.At a meeting with major energy companies in Houston on Monday, Lopetegui presented investment opportunities worth US$30 billion in the energy sector, including US$10 billion in oil and gas, US$8.2 billion in infrastructure, US$12 billion in electricity and renewables, and US$3 billion in access to new markets, the Argentine government said on its website.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.comOil Prices Jump As Saudis Promise To Do ""Whatever It Takes""Car Companies Close Stores As The “Amazon Effect” Takes HoldOil Prices Inch Higher On Venezuelan Crude Crisis

U.S. oil, natural gas, and coal are being produced in a more environmentally conscious manner than anywhere else on the planet, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Andrew Wheeler said in a keynote speech at CERAWeek in Houston, urging the world to buy American fossil fuels.Praising the Trump Administration’s efforts to lessen burdensome federal regulations, Wheeler said that the current Administration proved that such federal regulations “are not necessary to drive environmental progress.”“What the United States offers the world in terms of energy is that our fossil fuels are extracted and produced in a more environmentally conscious manner than anywhere else in the world. If other countries want to purchase coal on the open market, we mine our coal in a safer and more environmentally friendly manner than other nations. If you want to purchase oil on the open market, we extract and refine our oil in a more environmentally conscious manner than other nations. If Europe wants to buy natural gas on the marketplace, we produce our natural gas in a much cleaner fashion than Russia, for example,” Wheeler, a former coal lobbyist, said in his speech.



“When it comes to the environment and when it comes to national security, there is no better investment than American energy. That is why President Trump is committed to expanding our capacity to export our energy and technology worldwide. Pipelines that were stymied for years are finally getting built. And the construction of new export terminals is underway as we speak,” EPA’s Administrator said.Related: Oil Prices Jump As Saudis Promise To Do ""Whatever It Takes""Wheeler also had a word for those who oppose increased U.S. oil and gas production and for supporters of the Green New Deal.“Supporters of the Green New Deal – or plans like it – are not only oblivious to how far we’ve come, but also where we are headed,” he said, adding that a much better “deal” would be to maximize the value of U.S. natural resources and improve power generation.



“Rather than yielding the marketplace to China or Russia, we are encouraging innovation across the energy sector so American energy can power more homes and business throughout the world,” Wheeler said.“Here is our message to the free world: If you are looking to buy energy on the open market, look to the U.S.,” EPA’s Administrator said.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Is This A Precursor For Peak Oil Demand?Oil Prices Rise As Saudis Curb ExportsAnalysts: Permian Oil Output Set To Double By 2023

Shipping companies and insurers that take part in sending crude oil from Venezuela to Cuba have been “put on notice,” U.S. national security adviser John Bolton said in a tweet, following a declaration by the Venezuelan opposition-dominated National Assembly that all oil exports to Cuba must be suspended in the wake of the five-day blackout that wreaked havoc on the already struggling South American country.“The Venezuelan National Assembly has decreed the suspension of crude exports to Cuba following the collapse of the national electrical grid. Insurance companies and flag carriers that facilitate these give-away shipments to Cuba are now on notice,” Bolton tweeted.



Cuba is the closest regional ally of Venezuela and a major importer of its crude. The “on-notice” tweet is part of the latest escalation between Venezuelan and the United States after Washington slapped a fresh round of sanctions on PDVSA in January following Nicolas Maduro’s inauguration for a second term as president.Since then, Washington has increased the pressure by declaring its support for National Assembly President Juan Guaido. The declaration was followed by action. The U.S. seized PDVSA assets in the United States and set up a new account where importers of Venezuelan crude in the U.S. would transfer payments, to which only Guaido’s camp would have access.



Despite these actions, Maduro has clung on to power with the help of Russia, which, along with China, Turkey, and Bolivia, has taken the stance that he is the elected president.Meanwhile, Washington has turned to importers of Venezuelan crude, insisting that they stop buying it in a bid to cut off access to the market of Venezuela’s virtually one and only export commodity right now. Most recently, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo asked India to stop buying Venezuelan crude to sop being “the economic lifeline for the Maduro regime.” India is Venezuela’s second-largest oil buyer.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Asian LNG Prices Continue To TumbleOil Majors Are Taking Over The PermianBezos, Bloomberg And Gates Back Revolutionary Exploration Tech

The Venezuelan national Assembly, dominated by the opposition, declared a state of alarm over a blackout that the government blamed on a U.S. cyberattack and that plunged the struggling country into darkness and chaos for five days.Reuters reports as of Monday there was electricity in most of the capital Caracas, but the rest of the country was still without power for the most part.President Maduro said the blackout was instigated by the United States as part of a “demonic” plot seeking to remove him from power. The blackout, he said, was the result of an “electromagnetic attack.”The blackout also aggravated the already dramatic situation with the country’s oil industry, with Argus Media reporting on Sunday Venezuela’s largest oil export terminal and crude oil processing complex in Jose were both shut down. Also, three heavy crude upgraders that PDVSA operates together with its joint venture partners were suspended, according to local sources, as well as several petrochemical plants.



The blackout started at a 10GW hydroelectric facility, the Guri complex, and spread through a 765 kW transmission line to central Venezuela, leaving many with no power and water, as water supply systems also rely on the grid.The president of the National Assembly urged people to continue protesting against the government, blaming it for the blackout, which he called a catastrophe.Related: Two Largest Oil Price Benchmarks Are Set To Diverge""We all know who is responsible and we need to find solutions.

Last year’s resolution was rejected after EOG approached the Securities and Exchange Commission and received an exemption from a vote on the proposed resolution.Yet Trillium persevered, and its second attempt to push the company into the direction it waned worked, with EOG committing to “adopt quantitative targets for reducing methane emissions, and issue a report (at reasonable cost, in a reasonable time, and omitting proprietary information) discussing its plans and progress towards achieving these targets,” the investment firm’s statement read.



The Axios report quoted a Trillium executive as saying, “Engaging EOG is a slow and incremental process. Year after year we are able to get them to take additional steps. So over the course of 2019 and 2020, we will be continuing to engage and getting that specificity into the targets.”Related: Blackout Shuts Down Venezuela’s Oil ExportsActivist shareholders have stepped up the pressure on Big Oil to do more about reducing the adverse environmental impact of its business and shareholder resolutions have been a popular way of doing it.



In Europe, BP and Shell have become the target of such resolutions, originating with a Dutch activist investor Follow This. The resolutions calls for an overall reduction in the two supermajors’ carbon footprints, and the firm said it was considering similar proposals for Exxon and Chevron as well.“Targets should be on the agenda of every oil company, given that the oil industry can make or break the Paris Climate Agreement,” Reuters quoted Follow This founder Mark van Baal as saying last December.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads from Oilprice.com:Analysts: Permian Oil Output Set To Double By 2023OPEC+ Production Cuts To Stay In Place Until JuneIs Norway’s Oil & Gas Selloff A Mistake?

Crude oil production in the UK will decline this year to 940,000 bpd from last year’s 980,000 bpd, the Oil and Gas Authority said in a new report, adding that output will continue to decline in the next five years as well, reaching 760,000 bpd in 2024.Capital expenditure in the period will also decline substantially, the energy industry authority said. This year, it is seen at US$6.76 billion (5.2 billion pounds), falling to US$4.55 billion (3.5 billion pounds) in 2021 and US$3.31 billion (2.55 billion pounds) in 2024.



Still, despite the negative trend, the Oil and Gas Authority has updated its long-term production projection to 2050. Now, the authority expects the cumulative output of oil and gas for the period between 2015 and 2050 to be 3.9 billion barrels of oil equivalent higher than it projected in March 2015 and 200 million barrels of oil equivalent higher than OGA’s September 2018 projection.The increase in cumulative production will be the result of lower operating costs, which will combine with enhanced efficiency in oil and gas recovery in the North Sea, OGA said. New field development will also help this increase. In 2015-2050, according to these projections, the UK will have produced 11.9 billion barrels of oil and gas.



Interestingly enough, the decline in production will come just a year after output—including crude oil and natural gas liquids—hit a seven-year high of 1.09 million bpd, thanks, the OGA said, to the launch of 30 new fields since 2015 along with better asset integrity and more enhanced oil recovery projects at legacy fields.Operating costs have been falling over the last three years but are on their way up. As of last year, these averaged US$15.07 (11.6 pounds) but are set to rise to US$15.98 (12.3 pounds) this year and reach US$16.76 (12.9 pounds) per barrel in 2024.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Blackout Shuts Down Venezuela’s Oil ExportsNuclear Is Not A Catch-All Solution To Climate ChangeAnalysts: Permian Oil Output Set To Double By 2023

If the UK were to roll out fracking at its shale gas reserves, it could nearly eliminate its net gas imports by the early 2030s, industry group United Kingdom Onshore Oil and Gas (UKOOG) said in a report on Monday.The group has revised up its estimates for potential share gas production, after the recent flow test data from UK company Cuadrilla, which resumed fracking in England last year for the first time in seven years.According to UKOOG, the initial flow test at Cuadrilla’s Preston New Road (PNR) site in Lancashire “scaled up for a full-length lateral with all stages effectively hydraulically fractured, allows us to increase our previous estimates of production from each lateral.”UKOOG has estimated that a national roll-out of 100 pads of 40 laterals (4,000 laterals in total) would lead to the UK’s annual production peaking at almost 1,400 bcf in the early 2030s, which is equivalent to the gas use of 35 million homes, more than the UK total. The country’s net gas imports could be almost eliminated in the early 2030s, improving the balance of payments by around US$10.4 billion (£8 billion) a year, the industry group said.  



At present, the UK currently produces enough gas to meet 44 percent of its needs, while it imports 47 percent of its gas via pipelines from Norway and Europe, and another 9 percent in the form of liquefied natural gas (LNG).As production in the North Sea is expected to decline over the coming years and decades, estimates point to the UK becoming increasingly dependent on natural gas imports.Fracking in the UK, however, is met with fierce opposition from environmentalists, and the UK has strict tremor limits regulations that require pausing operations in case of micro seismic events of 0.50 on the Richter scale or higher. Cuadrilla said last month that initial flow tests at its fracking site in northwest England showed a rich reservoir with high-quality recoverable natural gas, while it also called for the rules on tremor limits to be eased so proper appraisals could be made. The company has had to stop operations multiple times, due to micro seismic events measuring above the threshold requiring a halt.Related: Refining Frenzy Worsens Fuel Glut In Asia



Last month, the UK government refused to allow Cuadrilla to frack at a second site in Lancashire, Roseacre Wood, citing an “unacceptable impact” and risk to the safety of people using the public highway.“We are naturally disappointed about the decision on Roseacre Wood,” Cuadrilla said, commenting on the refusal, and noted that it was focused on its first site at Preston New Road.Commenting on today’s UKOOG report, Cuadrilla’s CEO Francis Egan said:“We should not underestimate what is at stake here for the UK. Securing our domestic gas supply is only one part of this equation,” adding that “It is now imperative that people understand that they have nothing to fear from fracking and actually a huge amount to gain.”By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Nuclear Is Not A Catch-All Solution To Climate ChangeAnalysts: Permian Oil Output Set To Double By 2023Blackout Shuts Down Venezuela’s Oil Exports

The United States has pressed India to stop buying Venezuelan crude oil as a means of accelerating President Nicolas Maduro’s removal from office, which Washington has made its top priority in Latin America recently.“We say you should not be helping this regime. You should be on the side of the Venezuelan people,” the U.S. envoy for Venezuela Elliott Abrams told Reuters in an interview.Washington has been quick to throw its support behind the president of the National Assembly in Caracas, Juan Guaido, who declared himself interim president in late January and called for new, transparent elections.



India is not the only one that the Trump administration has been pressing to cut off oil ties with Venezuela as a way of cutting the Maduro government’s access to money, but it may be the most important yet.India, Reuters recalls, is the second-largest buyer of Venezuelan crude after the United States itself, and that stream has dried up as a new account was set up in the U.S. to process payments for Venezuelan crude oil imports into the country and make the money available to the Guaido camp.Yet India may be a lot less willing to comply with what Washington asks it to do: the United States now wants India to stop importing Iranian oil and just last week President Donald Trump signaled a new trade war might be in the making, this time with India.



“I am taking this step because, after intensive engagement between the United States and the Government of India, I have determined that India has not assured the United States that it will provide equitable and reasonable access to the markets of India,” Trump wrote in a letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and President of the Senate.Meanwhile, India is negotiating a sanction waiver extension for Iran, so it can continue importing Iranian crude at the rate it is doing currently, 300,000 bpd. This is much less than what it used to import from Iran before the U.S. sanctions snapped back last November but is, apparently, indispensable.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Blackout Shuts Down Venezuela’s Oil ExportsAnalysts: Permian Oil Output Set To Double By 2023Nuclear Is Not A Catch-All Solution To Climate Change

Less than two weeks after Tesla said that it would cut all vehicle prices by an average of 6 percent and shift sales on online only, the electric vehicle (EV) maker is backpedaling on the stores closure plan and is lifting car prices by 3 percent, except for the $35,000 Model 3.On February 28, Tesla said that the long-awaited US$35,000 Model 3 was now available, but in order to “remain financially sustainable”, the EV maker was shifting sales worldwide to online sales only, meaning it would be closing down stores.“Shifting all sales online, combined with other ongoing cost efficiencies, will enable us to lower all vehicle prices by about 6% on average, allowing us to achieve the $35,000 Model 3 price point earlier than we expected,” Tesla said at the end of February.



On Sunday, the auto maker said that after evaluating the retail stores’ locations, it had decided to “to keep significantly more stores open than previously announced as we continue to evaluate them over the course of several months.” As a result of this, “Tesla will need to raise vehicle prices by about 3% on average worldwide. In other words, we will only close about half as many stores, but the cost savings are therefore only about half.”There will be no price increase for the $35,000 Model 3, Tesla said, but added that the increases would apply to the more expensive variants of Model 3, as well as Model S and X.“Potential Tesla owners will have a week to place their order before prices rise, so current prices are valid until March 18th,” the EV maker said, which could add further confusion for potential buyers.Related: Refining Frenzy Worsens Fuel Glut In Asia



In the first weekend of March, Tesla owners staged protests outside Tesla stores and Superchargers in some parts of Asia after the company had announced the massive price cuts, meaning that existing customers for some models in some counties have paid by up to 40 percent more for their Teslas before the price reduction.In another Tesla-related development, law firm Grant & Eisenhofer said on Friday that it had filed a suit on behalf of institutional investors against Elon Musk and Tesla’s board “seeking to block Elon Musk from tweeting about Tesla” because “the CEO’s ongoing unchecked misstatements on Twitter have continued to harm the company and its shareholders.”“The lawsuit, filed in Delaware Court of Chancery, seeks a declaratory judgment and a permanent injunction against Mr. Musk over his unchecked use of Twitter to make inaccurate statements about the company,” Grant & Eisenhofer said.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Russia’s Next Oil Boom Is Happening In The ArcticAnalysts: Permian Oil Output Set To Double By 2023Oil Prices Rise As Saudis Curb Exports

In its fight against coal emissions pollution, China significantly stepped up its coal-to-natural gas and coal-to-electricity switch to 35 cities last year from 12 cities in 2017, but the next steps to curb stifling pollution levels in cities would be much harder, according to Chinese Environment Minister Li Ganjie.A total of 4.8 million Chinese households made the switch from coal to natural gas and electricity in 2018, up from 4 million households who had switched away from coal in 2017, Reuters quoted Li as saying at a press conference on Monday. “The things that could easily be done have already mostly been done, and the things that need to be done afterwards are much harder,” Li said.



In the previous winter, the coal-to-natural gas switch policy led to gas shortages in many areas in north China, but the country has managed its natural gas imports and needs much better this winter season. The policy to curb coal use resulted in China becoming the key driver on the global liquefied natural gas (LNG) market over the past few years.In 2018, China’s natural gas imports—including pipeline and LNG imports—soared by nearly 32 percent from 2017 to a record 90.39 million tons, solidifying China’s position as the world’s biggest importer of the fuel.Related: Saudis Follow Up On Deeper Oil Output Cuts PromiseRising domestic production and improved pipeline infrastructure help China to ration natural gas flows to avoid last winter’s severe gas shortages, and its LNG demand growth—albeit at a slower pace—is still set to be the key driver of global LNG demand growth.



According to the BP Energy Outlook 2019 published last month, China’s energy demand growth will slow down to 1.1 percent annually through 2040, less than one fifth of its pace in the last 22 years—which was 5.9 percent per year. Despite slowing energy demand growth, China will still be the world’s biggest energy consumer, accounting for 22 percent of global energy consumption in 2040, BP says.The share of coal in China’s energy mix will drop to 35 percent in 2040 from 60 percent in 2017, BP has estimated, while it sees Chinese oil import dependence rising to 76 percent in 2040 from 67 percent in 2017, and gas import dependence growing to 43 percent from 38 percent.  By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Why Oil Markets Can’t Find A Solid FootingOPEC+ Production Cuts To Stay In Place Until JuneIs Norway’s Oil & Gas Selloff A Mistake?

The global refining industry faces a wave of new capacity additions to 2024 that would greatly exceed demand growth for refined products, and this may result in refinery closures to rebalance the market, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said in its Oil 2019 annual report on Monday.Refiners around the world are expected to add 9 million bpd of new capacity through 2024, the Paris-based agency said in its report, noting that China is expected to overtake the United States as the world’s leader in installed refining capacity.“Given that these new additions far exceed the increase in demand for refined products, plant closures might be necessary to rebalance the market, though questions remain as to where and when that will happen,” the IEA noted.



In its monthly Oil Market Report in January this year, the IEA said refiners face a challenging year in 2019, with processing capacity set to increase by 2.6 million bpd, the biggest growth in four decades, “while margins are already pressured by low gasoline cracks due to oversupply and weak demand.”Apart from a surge in planned refinery capacity, the downstream sector globally is on the cusp of “one of the biggest shakeups ever,” the IEA said, referring to the new sulfur content regulations by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) as of January 1, 2020.The IEA estimates in today’s report that demand for high sulfur fuel oil (HSFO), the main vessel fuel since the 1960s, will plunge to 1.4 million bpd from 3.5 million bpd in just one year, and that there will be 4,000 scrubbers installed on large vessels by the end of 2020, consuming 700,000 bpd of fuel oil.Related: Onboard Hydrogen: Is This The Future Of Zero Emission Vehicles?



The drop in fuel oil demand and the rise of petrochemicals over the next few years will benefit the U.S. oil producers whose typical crude products are lighter, the IEA said.“[T]he average global product barrel is getting lighter as fuel oil demand falls and petrochemicals grow in importance,” according to the IEA.“As a result, the United States will be in prime position as a supplier of light types of crude oil that are in growing demand. Shale oil will also help meet the new IMO requirements and provide the quantities of naphtha required for the petrochemicals industry,” the agency said.

The Sharara crude oil field in Libya will recover its daily rate of production to 300,000 bpd within two weeks, Reuters reports, quoting a field engineer. The country’s largest field could produce more than 315,000 bpd but has been plagued by outages, the latest among which lasted almost three months.The field was originally closed for production in December, when clashes between militant groups forced the National Oil Corporation of Libya to institute a force majeure, which was only lifted last week. Originally, locals occupied Sharara in early December with demands for better economic conditions and power supply security. The occupation lasted until early February, when the Libyan National Army, a group affiliated with the eastern Libyan government, took control of the field.



The force majeure remained in place as the NOC refused to yield to the locals’ demands for payments, deeming them ransom demands and warning this would set a dangerous precedent. Then, making the situation more complicated, the LNA faced the Petroleum Facilities Guard, an old adversary and a group loyal to the UN-recognized Libyan government. The situation was resolved only at the end of February with mediation from the United Arab Emirates.According to NOC’s chairman, Mustafa Sanalla, the three-month blockade of the field had cost it US$1.8 million and 20,000 bpd in lost production capacity as a result of vandalism and looting. Last week NOC said it was working to restore the 20,000 bpd in lost capacity at the field.



Sharara has become the main reason Libya was exempted from the latest round of production cuts and also the main reason the North African country is widely seen as a wild card in global oil price forecasts. Since it accounts for around a third of the country’s total oil output, Sharara, like the export terminals in the Oil Crescent, has become a natural target for various groups vying for power and control over Libya’s oil wealth.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Is Norway’s Oil & Gas Selloff A Mistake?The Easy Money In European Natural Gas Is GoneOil Looks Set For A Significant Drop As Bad Data Piles Up

The oil ministers of Saudi Arabia and India will meet on Saturday, Reuters quoted India’s Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan as saying on Friday.Although the Indian minister did not go into specifics about the meeting, it’s probably safe to assume that Khalid al-Falih, the oil minister of OPEC’s biggest producer Saudi Arabia, and Pradhan, the oil minister of one of the fastest-growing oil demand countries, will discuss oil supplies and/or investments.Saudi Arabia is currently India’s second-largest oil supplier after Iraq and it has just pledged to invest US$100 billion in India’s energy sector in its continued efforts to lock in future demand for its oil on the fastest-growing Asian markets.



In June last year, Saudi oil giant Saudi Aramco and the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) signed a framework agreement and a memorandum of understanding with a consortium of Indian national oil companies to join a mega refinery and petrochemical complex worth US$44 billion in the Maharashtra state on India’s west coast. The project, however, has seen some setbacks recently, as the process of land acquisition was halted amid farmers’ opposition and as plans emerged to relocate the complex to another site in the Maharashtra state.The meeting between Saudi Arabia’s al-Falih and India’s Pradhan will take place less than two months before the U.S. waivers for Iranian oil customers—including India—to continue importing oil from Iran at reduced volumes expire.India is in talks with the U.S., asking for an extension of its waiver to continue importing oil from Iran at the current rate of around 300,000 bpd, Reuters reported on Thursday, citing two sources in India familiar with the issue.



In January this year, Iran slipped to seventh place among India’s main oil suppliers, from the third place it held at the same time last year.The report of India-U.S. talks over a waiver extension beyond early May comes just as U.S. President Donald Trump announced earlier this week that he plans to end the preferential trade treatment for India.“I am taking this step because, after intensive engagement between the United States and the Government of India, I have determined that India has not assured the United States that it will provide equitable and reasonable access to the markets of India,” President Trump wrote in a letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and President of the Senate.  By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Two Largest Oil Price Benchmarks Are Set To DivergeU.S. Will Soon Export More Oil, Liquids Than Saudi ArabiaRig Count Slides As U.S. Oil Output Remains At All-Time High

The Oil Companies International Marine Forum (OCIMF) and international shipping associations have reduced the so-called High Risk Area for piracy attacks on ships and tankers in the Indian Ocean, but emphasized that serious threat remains despite the area reduction, one of the associations, the International Chamber of Shipping, said on Friday.Despite the geographical reduction of the High Risk Area, which will become effective on May 1, 2019, the numerous shipping organizations—including such representing the oil shipping industry—warn that ship owners and merchant ship operators need to remain vigilant because the piracy threat still exists.



“The reduction to the High Risk Area takes full account of recent shipping industry experience, pirate intent and capability and follows extensive consultation with nations, collations and military naval forces, including Combined Maritime Forces, EUNAVFOR and the United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO), which continue to provide vital advice and protection to shipping,” the organizations said in a statement.The Indian Ocean is between the eastern coast of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula and Asia to its north, where a lot of oil tanker traffic is taking place every day.



The Strait of Hormuz, for example, is the world’s most important chokepoint, with an oil flow of 18.5 million bpd in 2016, the EIA estimates. The Strait connects the Persian Gulf with the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea and is the key route through which Persian Gulf exporters—Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Qatar, the UAE, and Bahrain—ship their oil.Earlier this year, the International Chamber of Commerce’s International Maritime Bureau (IMB) published its annual piracy report, which showed that the number of piracy incidents in the world increased in 2018, due to a marked rise in attacks against ships and crews around West Africa. The IMB Piracy Reporting Centre (PRC) recorded 201 incidents of maritime piracy and armed robbery globally last year, up from 180 such incidents in 2017.

Saudi Arabia’s Air Force shot down on Friday a drone flying over the Kingdom’s airspace, which the Saudi-led military coalition in Yemen said was coming from the Houthi rebels, Saudi state television reported.  The Iran-aligned Houthi rebels have been fighting a Saudi-led Arab coalition in Yemen since 2015, and the Houthis have claimed over these years that they have targeted and hit oil facilities of Saudi Aramco in Saudi Arabia.According to the Saudi-led coalition, the Houthis were responsible for launching the drone shot down today and were targeting civilians, the Saudi television said.  Colonel Turki al-Maliki, a spokesman for the Saudi-led coalition, said that inspection of the drone debris showed “Iranian characteristics and specifications.”



Saudi-owned Al Arabiya TV reported that before being shot, the drone had been flying toward residential areas in a town some 230 kilometers (143 miles) north of the Saudi border with Yemen.According to al-Maliki, several civilians sustained minor injuries from the drone fragments when it was shot down.he Iran-aligned Houthi rebels in Yemen said last summer that they had targeted Saudi Aramco’s refinery in the Saudi capital Riyadh with a long-range drone. The Houthi rebels also targeted a Saudi oil tanker in the Bab el Mandeb strait off the Hodeidah port in July last year, although it caused but minimal damage.



In December 2018, Yemen’s warring parties agreed to a UN-brokered ceasefire in and around the key port of Hodeidah, to facilitate the humanitarian access and the flow of goods to the civilian population who are suffering from the world’s worst humanitarian crisis.Three weeks after the UN-brokered ceasefire in Hodeidah entered into force, the warring sides continued to trade accusations in January over who had broken the fragile truce.The Houthis violated the Hodeidah truce 1,112 times between mid-December and mid-February, in which 76 civilians died and 492 were injured, Arab News reported last month, quoting Saudi state news agency SPA.

The Iranian Navy has intervened to thwart a pirate attack on one of Iran’s oil tankers in the critical Bab el-Mandeb Strait around the Arabian Peninsula, Iranian media reported on Friday, quoting a Navy official.The Bab el-Mandeb Strait is one of the three crucial chokepoints around the Arabian Peninsula. Located between Yemen, Djibouti, and Eritrea, Bab el-Mandeb connects the Red Sea with the Gulf of Aden and the Arabian Sea.According to Iran’s Mehr news agency, pirates on 11 speedboats attacked on Thursday a tanker carrying 150,000 tons of cargo and Iranian naval forces intervened to repel the pirates.



An Iranian fleet including a destroyer, a logistical warship, and a battleship started its mission in international waters on January 23, the Mehr agency reports, adding that Iran has dispatched in recent years more vessels to the Indian Ocean and the Gulf of Aden to protect its ships from Somali pirates.Related: Norway’s $1 Trillion Wealth Fund To Dump All Its Oil & Gas StocksLast month, as the U.S. sanctions on Iran’s oil industry had already started to mount pressure on Tehran and had halved Iranian oil exports, the Islamic Republic announced that its Navy would hold an annual drill in the Strait of Hormuz—the world’s most important oil chokepoint and one of the three chokepoints around the Arabian Peninsula together with Bab el-Mandeb and the Suez Canal.Iran has threatened several times to close the Strait of Hormuz for all tanker traffic if the U.S. drives Iranian oil exports to zero.



The Strait of Hormuz is the world’s most important chokepoint, with an oil flow of 18.5 million bpd in 2016, the EIA estimates. The Strait connects the Persian Gulf with the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea and is the key route through which Persian Gulf exporters—Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Qatar, the UAE, and Bahrain—ship their oil. Only Saudi Arabia and the UAE have pipelines that can ship crude oil outside of the Persian Gulf and have additional pipeline capacity to bypass the Strait of Hormuz, which is a route of more than 30 percent of daily global seaborne-traded crude oil and petroleum products and more than 30 percent of the liquefied natural gas (LNG) flows.

Jeremy Hunt, the UK’s Foreign Secretary assured the oil and gas industry that Brexit will not wreak havoc on it despite mounting concerns across industries that the country’s exit from the European Union will have devastating consequences.Energy Voice quotes Hunt as saying local oil and gas businesses had the resilience to withstand the fallout from Brexit, acknowledging their worry regarding the possibility of tariffs, supply chain disruptions, and other problems that the UK’s departure from the EU will likely bring about.



“We are absolutely determined to deliver a pro-business Brexit. The oil and gas industry is absolutely essential to the British economy – 300,000 jobs, one third of which are in Scotland. Aberdeen is central to that.” Hunt said ahead of a visit to Aberdeen, where he is facing the disgruntlement of the Scottish National Party over the central government’s determination to continue pursuing its Brexit plans despite the increasingly likelihood of a hard rather than soft exit that will affect all industries and specifically oil and gas, which are central to Scotland’s budget.Among the problems that oil and gas companies based in the UK will face after Brexit are a higher trade bill with the EU if tariffs are instituted as the country stops being a member of the common EU market, more red tape that could delay equipment deliveries from Europe, and workforce security as foreign workers in the UK’s oil and gas industry represent about 5 percent of the total.



Jeremy Hunt called for all stakeholders to back PM Theresa May’s proposed deal for Brexit to avoid the worst fallout, adding “If that passes through then we would be on track to have a completely tariff free trading relationship with the rest of Europe going forward.”As the deadline for the UK’s exit from the European Union approaches, all industries are getting increasingly jittery about what happens after, as the chances of a deal that serves equally well both sides vanished a long time ago and now the question seems to be whether the UK will leave with a bad deal or no deal at all.

Crude oil and natural gas imports to China continued rising in February although they were off the all-time highs booked a few months ago, Reuters reports, citing customs data.Crude oil imports stood at 39.22 million tons, or 10.23 million bpd, which was a 21.6-percent increase on the year and the fourth consecutive month of an import rate above 10 million tons. The hefty increase at the end of 2018 was a result of independent refiners’ rush to fill in their import quotas before the year’s end, but now imports have remained strong even at lower quotas that the Chinese Ministry of Commerce issued in January.



In natural gas, Chinese customs data showed the total intake, including LNG and pipeline shipments, stood at 7.55 million tons last month, which was down from January, when China imported 9.81 million tons of natural gas, but up on February 2018, by 8.8 percent.China is on track to become the world’s largest LNG importer for more than a month as Japan continues restarting its nuclear reactors, which will affect its LNG imports negatively and lead it to cede the top spot in imports of liquefied natural gas to China sooner rather than later. In fact, there are projections China will become the largest consumer of imported LNG as soon as 2022.



In January, LNG imports to China broke all records reaching 6.55 million tons, up by 2 percent from the previous record set in December. However, the winter turned out milder than would justify this massive intake of LNG and many importers are stranded with more LNG than they can’t sell.China’s total natural gas demand is expected to rise by 11.4 percent in 2019 over 2018, slower than the growth in previous years, according to analysts at the country’s largest oil and gas producer China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC).By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Exxon Punished By Wall Street For Spending StrategyU.S. Will Soon Export More Oil, Liquids Than Saudi ArabiaIs This As Good As It Gets For Oil?

Russian exports of oil and oil products to the United States surged in the last week of February to their highest level since 2011, with Russia taking advantage of the Venezuelan collapse, Russian news outlet RBC reports, quoting investment bank Caracas Capital Markets as saying in a note to clients.At least nine tankers delivered 3.19 million barrels of oil and oil products of Russian origin to U.S. ports in the week February 23 to March 1, according to Caracas Capital Markets, which specializes in Venezuela. These 3.19 million barrels is the largest volume of Russian oil deliveries “we have seen since 2011,” Russ Dallen, Caracas Capital Markets Managing Partner, wrote in the note, as carried by RBC.Most of the Russian oil deliveries were naphtha and fuel oil, and tankers from Novorossiysk and St Petersburg, among others, shipped the oil products to U.S. ports, Caracas Capital said, citing the U.S. database of shipping documents.  



The rise in Russian oil shipments to the U.S. is the result of the U.S. markets adapting to the loss of Venezuelan oil, RBC quoted the bank as saying.Ironically, Russia—the staunchest supporter of Nicolas Maduro’s regime in Venezuela—is benefiting in the U.S. oil market from the U.S. sanctions on Maduro’s government, on the state oil firm PDVSA, and on the Venezuelan oil industry.Meanwhile, Venezuela’s crude oil exports to the U.S. are dropping.



U.S. crude oil imports from Venezuela slumped to just 83,000 bpd in the week to March 1, compared to 208,000 bpd in the previous week, according to EIA’s preliminary data on crude oil imports by top 10 countries of origin, ranked based on 2017 data.The U.S. sanctions on Venezuela are also prohibiting U.S. exports of naphtha to the Latin American country which uses the product to dilute its heavy crude. But Russia’s Rosneft is said to be coming to the rescue with shipments of heavy naphtha to Venezuela expected in the next few weeks, Bloomberg reported earlier this week, citing shipping reports and a source with knowledge of the plans.  By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:What’s Behind The Cobalt Price Crash?Bezos, Bloomberg And Gates Back Revolutionary Exploration TechSupertanker Rates Soar As U.S. Oil Exports Hit All-Time High

Large volumes of natural gas have been found in the Red Sea, according to the official Saudi Press Agency (SPA) which quoted Saudi Arabia’s Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih as saying.Saudi oil giant Aramco is considering opportunities for acquisitions of liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects in the United States, al-Falih has also said, according to a Reuters summary of SPA’s news item.In January this year, Saudi Aramco’s chief executive Amin Nasser told Reuters in an interview that the oil firm was looking to spend billions of U.S. dollars on natural gas acquisitions in the United States as part of Aramco’s strategy to bolster its gas business and become a global natural gas player. 



Last week, Nasser said at an industry event in London that Saudi Arabia aims to export as much as 3 billion cubic feet of gas per day by 2030 as part of its goal to boost the international footprint of its natural gas business.Aramco will solely develop Saudi Arabia’s conventional and unconventional gas reserves, and the options for exports include exports via pipelines and LNG, according to Aramco’s top manager.In November last year, Nasser said at an event in Dubai that Saudi Aramco, already a top global oil producer but not as strong in gas production, will boost efforts to grow its natural gas output, from both conventional and unconventional reserves.



Saudi Aramco’s gas development program is expected to attract as much as US$150 billion in investment over the next decade, Nasser said. Natural gas production is expected to jump to 23 billion standard cubic feet a day from the current 14 billion cubic feet a day, Aramco’s top executive said in Dubai a few months ago.“We also have world-class unconventional gas resources that are rapidly supplementing our large conventional resources. Because a significant proportion of this unconventional gas is rich in both liquids and ethane, its production will play an important role in the further growth of the Kingdom’s chemicals sector,” Nasser said.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Local Gas Shortage Threatens Australia’s LNG DreamBloomberg Launches Alternative To Green New DealShould We Rethink Nuclear Power?

The first U.S. floating liquefied natural gas (LNG) project continues to plan future steps in its progress despite the U.S.-China trade war, a top manager at one of the project’s partners told Reuters on Thursday.The first U.S. floating LNG (FLNG) project, Delfin LNG, is planned to be located nearly 50 miles off the Louisiana coast in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. According to the project’s website, it could use up to four FLNG vessels which would cut coastal LNG traffic, while minimize near-shore environmental impacts.As early as in November 2017, Delfin Midstream, the developer of the Delfin LNG project, signed a preliminary agreement with China Gas Holdings, a city gas distributor, to supply 3 million tons of LNG annually.But China, the world’s fastest-growing LNG demand market, slapped a 10-percent tariff on U.S. LNG imports amid the heated trade tariff tit-for-tat last summer.



Yet, Wouter Pastoor, the chief operating officer Delfin Midstream, told Reuters today that a resolution to the trade deal could arrive soon.“We do not believe the tariffs and trade disputes will last long,” Pastoor told Reuters. Delfin is currently working with a Chinese shipyard for the FLNG vessel and sees strong interest from China for both converting FLNG vessels and for importing LNG, according to Pastoor. Delfin has also seen strong interest from Chinese banks, among others, for financing of the project, the manager told Reuters.Related: Local Gas Shortage Threatens Australia’s LNG DreamThe partners in Delfin LNG target a final investment decision (FID) by the end of 2019, potentially launching production in the latter half of 2023.



Earlier this week, Reuters reported that China’s biggest refiner Sinopec is preparing to sign a 20-year LNG supply deal with Cheniere Energy when the U.S.-China trade conflict gets resolved as many in the energy market anticipate. If the U.S.-China trade war ends with a mutually agreeable deal, this would mean a lot not just for established exporters such as Cheniere, but for newcomers on the market who need funding to build their export terminals. To get it from banks, however, they need long-term delivery commitments and these have become hard to come by amid the trade dispute.Besides the planned projects, there are three more due to come on stream by the end of this year: the Cameron LNG in Louisiana, the Freeport LNG in Texas, and the Elba Island LNG plant.

Tesla says that it is introducing its next-generation V3 Supercharging, which is expected to ultimately reduce the amount of time drivers spend charging their electric vehicle by an average of 50 percent, as the EV maker aims to address one of the barriers to faster EV adoption—charging time and charging infrastructure.V3 Supercharging will enable Tesla’s vehicles “to charge faster than any other electric vehicle on the market today,” the EV maker said in a statement.Giving some examples of the faster charging speed, Tesla says that a Model 3 Long Range “operating at peak efficiency can recover up to 75 miles of charge in 5 minutes and charge at rates of up to 1,000 miles per hour.”



Thanks to the V3 Supercharger and other technical improvements, Tesla expects “the typical charging time at a V3 Supercharger will drop to around 15 minutes.”Tesla will be initially launching V3 Supercharging for its highest-volume vehicle, Model 3, and will expand access as it assesses the results of millions of charging events.“Our first non-beta V3 Supercharger site will break ground next month, with North American sites ramping in Q2 and Q3 before coming to Europe and Asia-Pacific in Q4,” Tesla said.



While the Supercharger is making headlines, some Tesla followers started speculating what a wrapped pickup truck was doing on a spotted carrier loaded with Tesla vehicles, Electrek’s Fred Lambert reports.While users commented on Reddit that the wrapped truck shown on the photo has an exhaust pipe, some speculate that it could be a test mule for an electric powertrain.When Elon Musk teased a Model Y unveil event on March 14, he also replied to twitter users that the truck unveil “is later this year” and that “Personally, I’m most excited by the Tesla Truck. Maybe it will be too futuristic for most people, but I love it.”By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Is This As Good As It Gets For Oil?The Next Major Flashpoint For U.S. ShaleU.S. Will Soon Export More Oil, Liquids Than Saudi Arabia

The UK government launched on Thursday a joint government-industry Offshore Wind Sector Deal, which is expected to significantly raise the share of renewable energy generation by 2030 and help it overtake fossil fuel-powered generation for the first time in UK history.By 2030, the UK government expects 70 percent of the electricity generated in the UK to come from low-carbon sources, with offshore wind power in the country’s generation rising to 30 percent by 2030.According to the latest quarterly figures from the UK’s Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy, the share of low carbon electricity generation accounted for a record high 56 percent in the third quarter of 2018, up from 54 percent in the same period of 2017, thanks to higher power generation from renewable sources.



Renewables share of electricity generation jumped to a record 33.1 percent in Q3 2018, from 30.0 percent in Q3 2017, with renewable electricity capacity at 43.2 GW at the end of the third quarter of 2018, up by 10 percent, or 3.9 GW, compared to a year earlier.According to the new Offshore Wind Sector Deal unveiled today, the share of offshore wind of the annual UK power generation rose from just 0.8 percent in 2010 to 6.2 percent in 2017, and is expected to further rise to around 10 percent by 2020.The UK government and the industry are committing to long-term certainty in renewable power contracts and investments in infrastructure, respectively, to boost the offshore wind industry in the UK.



The sector will deliver total infrastructure investments of over US$52.5 billion (£40 billion) by 2030, based on the sector’s estimates, according to the deal. The UK government, for its part, will provide up to US$732 million (£557 million) available for future Contracts for Difference.The deal is also expected to triple the number of jobs in the UK offshore wind sector to 27,000 by 2030.

The Trump administration is set to unleash its offshore, five-year oil drilling plan within weeks, Reuters reported, quoting an unnamed source in the know. The plan is being prepared amid strong opposition from the local authorities of coastal states.Last year, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management proposed to open up more than 90 percent of the coastal waters in the U.S. outer continental shelf in 47 lease sales that would include areas off the coast of California that were last leased during the 1980s.



The U.S. outer continental shelf holds technically recoverable reserves estimated at 550 million barrels of oil and 1.25 trillion cu ft of natural gas. The Gulf of Mexico was made the focus of the 2017-2022 plan because of the consistent interest of oil and gas explorers in the area, the high resource potential, and not least, the extensiveness of production infrastructure, a statement from the Department of the Interior from 2017 said. During this period, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management will hold two lease sales for the Gulf of Mexico every year.However, the Trump administration has made it perfectly clear that it would like to open more acreage to drillers along the coast of the country. That has drawn opposition from both Democrat and Republican leaders in the coastal states.



For example, USA Today earlier this month quoted South Carolina’s Republican Governor Henry McMaster as saying “The administration is well aware of the state’s position, which is why we oppose the drilling."" Georgia’s also Republic governor said ""I support offshore drilling. I just don't think we need to be doing it off the coast of Georgia.”These two are a small part of the opposing group that has had the Department of the Interior struggling to find a way to accommodate individual state interests and Trump’s America-First energy strategy. So far, one proposed solution has been to shrink the size of blocks to be offered under the new five-year lease sale plan, or to even remove some blocks from the plan.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Is This As Good As It Gets For Oil?Survey: Experts See Brent Oil Price In The $60s In 2019Vietnam’s Energy Dilemma Is About To Become A Crisis

Oil and gas production costs on the Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS) rose by 7 percent in 2018 compared to 2017, ending a streak of several years of continuous cost reductions, Norway’s state-owned oil and gas firm Petoro said in its annual report on Thursday.Petoro, which manages the Norwegian government’s stakes in Norway’s oil and gas fields and is a partner in many licenses on the shelf, delivered a total of US$13.8 billion (120 billion Norwegian crowns) to the state in 2018, up by US$3.8 billion (33 billion crowns) compared to 2017, in one of the best years ever in Petoro’s history, the company said.However, Petoro noted that the effect of the drastic cost cuts has started to level off.



“We are not seeing the results of further efficiency gains on our bottom line for 2018,” Petoro said.The 7-percent rise in costs is worrying, the company noted, adding that “We are dependent on the efforts made in recent years having a lasting effect, so that we can reduce costs further through continued improvement in all parts of the value chain.”“The Norwegian shelf is better-equipped now than it has been for quite some time. Over the last few years, we have matured robust projects that are competitive, even with significant price fluctuations. This is a competitive advantage we must work hard to preserve,” Petoro’s president and CEO Grethe Moen said.Related: Vietnam’s Energy Dilemma Is About To Become A Crisis



Cooperation and an innovative supplier industry will be crucial for boosting competitiveness on the NCS going forward, according to the company.Over the past few years, operators offshore Norway have significantly cut costs, and the Johan Castberg oil field in the Arctic Barents Sea is one of the examples of those cost reductions.After the oil price crash in 2014, Equinor and its partners in Johan Castberg—Eni Norge and Petoro—changed the plan concept and tried different solutions to halve the initial capital expenditures of more than US$12.4 billion (100 billion Norwegian crowns) and to make the project profitable at below US$35 a barrel of oil, compared to the original breakeven oil price of above US$80 a barrel, Equinor said last year.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:U.S. Will Soon Export More Oil, Liquids Than Saudi ArabiaIs This As Good As It Gets For Oil?Survey: Experts See Brent Oil Price In The $60s In 2019

Iran is smuggling crude oil in violation of the U.S. sanctions and this needs to stop, Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said, urging the international community to do the stopping, the Times of Israel reports.Speaking at a graduation ceremony at a naval base in Haifa, the Prime Minister said “Iran is trying to bypass the sanctions on it through the covert smuggling of petroleum via the sea,” adding “As these attempts expand, the navy will have a more important role in efforts to block these Iranian actions.”The latter part of this statement is particularly interesting since the Israeli navy has not traditionally had any presence in the Persian Gulf.



The Israeli Prime Minister also called on the international community to “halt, by any means, Iran’s attempts to bypass the sanctions via the sea.”However most of what we usually mean by the international community is still part of the Iran nuclear deal: the UK, France, Germany, Russia, and China. None of these countries wants to antagonize Iran or cut off relations with it, which makes Neanyahu’s calls for halting Iran’s oil exports devoid of actual meaning.Last month, Iran carried out a large-scale military drill in the Persian Gulf in the latest muscle-flexing exercise as the United States—which unlike Israel has a presence in the Gulf—steps up the sanction pressure on Tehran.



Several Tehran officials have threatened to close off the Strait of Hormuz if the country’s oil exports are reduced to zero, which has prompted the U.S. to strengthen its presence in the Gulf. So far, the threats have not had consequences, with the likelihood of Iran’s oil exports going down to zero roughly equal to the likelihood of any other power present in the Gulf letting it close off the world’s top oil chokepoint.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Goldman: OPEC To Clear Supply Glut By AprilThe Next Major Flashpoint For U.S. ShaleVietnam’s Energy Dilemma Is About To Become A Crisis

Venezuela’s struggling oil company PDVSA declared a maritime emergency after a German company operating a portion of its tanker fleet said it planned to return ten vessels because of unpaid fees, Reuters reports, citing a PDVSA document and anonymous sources.The news is the latest in a string of bad tidings for PDVSA, which has found itself juggling falling crude oil production due to mismanagement and U.S. sanctions, and an outflow of qualified personnel, including in the tanker department.According to Reuters, the company needs as many as 160 people, including tanker captains, machinists, and operators, to bring back the ships that Germany Bernhard Schulte Ship Management (BSM) is returning because of unpaid fees. However, PDVSA does not have these crews.



The pile of unpaid PDVSA bills is getting higher: last month, the German company said it would abandon two of the Venezuelan company’s vessels in Portugal because of unpaid bills to a number of third-party companies.Another tanker operated by BSM on behalf of PDVSA was seized by a group of shipping firms in Curacao, again because they were owed money by the Venezuelan company and were not getting any.In total, Reuters reports, there are more than a dozen tankers loaded with Venezuelan crude around the world that are being held in arrest because of unpaid bills.



The struggle for PDVSA has been tough, but the latest round of U.S. sanctions made it even tougher as they specifically targeted the state oil company, effectively cutting its access to U.S. refiners, with Washington urging other buyers of Venezuelan oil to steer clear of it.The pressure is aimed at removing President Nicolas Maduro from office and replacing him with opposition leader Juan Guaido who declared himself interim president and called for new elections in January. For now, however, the Maduro government is holding on to power as several million Venezuelans have left the country amid hyperinflation and shortages of basic goods.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Asian LNG Prices Continue To TumbleOil Majors Are Taking Over The PermianBezos, Bloomberg And Gates Back Revolutionary Exploration Tech

Russia’s largest oil producer, state-run Rosneft, plans to open a trading arm in Singapore in a bid to boost its crude sales on the fastest-growing oil market in the world, Reuters reported on Wednesday, citing six sources with knowledge of the company’s strategy.Rosneft registered Rosneft Singapore at the end of last year and plans to relocate several employees from Moscow to Singapore this spring and summer, according to the sources.The Russian oil giant has also reportedly picked a top crude trader, Andrey Bogatenkov, who is currently the first deputy head of crude and product exports for Rosneft in Moscow, to lead the new Asian trading division, some of the sources told Reuters.



Rosneft has started to pay more attention to the fast-growing Asian oil consumer market, aiming to seize more opportunities there, as U.S. sanctions have made Western financing for Russian firms more complicated. This has made many Russian energy firms, including Rosneft, to increasingly borrow more funds from Asian companies and banks.According to Russia’s energy ministry data cited by Reuters, Rosneft’s crude oil exports to markets in Asia Pacific stood at 51 million tons, or 1 million bpd, in 2018. This was around half of Rosneft’s foreign crude oil sales.In November last year, Rosneft signed a crude oil supply deal with China National Chemical Corporation (ChemChina) to send ESPO crude of up to 2.4 million tons through the Kozmino port for a year.



“Conclusion of the contract will lead to an increase in direct supplies of oil to the strategic Chinese market and ensure a guaranteed cost-effective export channel for the Company's crude sales,” Rosneft said in November, adding that its crude oil sales to China accounted for 6.5 percent of total Chinese crude oil imports in 2017.In India, another key growth Asian market, Rosneft holds 49.13 percent in Nayara Energy Limited, which owns the second largest private refinery in the country.  By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:OPEC Chief: U.S. Shale Helped Avert Total Chaos In Oil MarketsRussia To Defend Its Venezuela Oil Assets In ‘Toughest Way Possible’Oil Majors Are Taking Over The Permian

Canada recorded a record trade deficit in December 2018, almost entirely due to declining energy exports as a result of falling crude oil prices and decade-low Canadian oil prices, Statistics Canada said on Wednesday.Canada’s exports dropped by 3.8 percent in December, while imports rose by 1.6 percent, due to higher imports of energy products. As a result, Canada’s trade deficit with the world widened to a record US$3.44 billion (C$4.6 billion) in December from US$1.5 billion (C$2.0 billion) in November.Excluding energy products, Canada’s exports were essentially unchanged in December. Since July, Canadian exports have dropped by 9.8 percent, and energy products were responsible for 80 percent of that decline, Statistics Canada said.  



Canadian exports of energy products slumped by 21.7 percent in December, to the lowest level since July 2016. Crude oil exports plunged by 28.7 percent to US$2.5 billion (C$3.3 billion), down by more than half since peaking in July 2018, according to Statistics Canada.As Canadian oil production was growing last year, takeaway capacity constraints and maintenance at U.S. refineries in the fall of 2018 drove down the price of Western Canadian Select (WCS)—the benchmark price of oil from Canada’s oil sands—to as low as US$14 a barrel in October and November, with its discount to WTI at around US$50 a barrel.  In early December, the Alberta government moved in to shore up the price of Canadian heavy oil and in the most drastic measure yet, the province of Alberta mandated an oil production cut of 325,000 bpd beginning in January 2019.



Alberta eased some of the cuts last week, saying that April oil production would be up by 100,000 bpd compared to the initial limit set for January.In recent weeks, the discount of WCS to WTI has been below US$15 a barrel, compared to more than a US$40 differential in the fall of 2018.

One of the world’s largest carmakers, Germany’s Volkswagen AG, is betting big on electric vehicles and e-mobility with a war chest of around US$50 billion to challenge Tesla, which, for the time being seems unfazed by the increasingly crowded EV market.Three years after the diesel emissions scandal, Volkswagen said last November that it would invest US$49.7 billion (44 billion euro) on e-mobility, autonomous driving, new mobility services, and digitalization in vehicles and at plants through 2023. This investment would represent around one third of all expenditure for the 2019-2023 period that Volkswagen has planned.  At the Geneva Motor Show this week, Volkswagen staged the world premiere of the electric ID. BUGGY.



“The ID. BUGGY demonstrates the broad spectrum of emission-free mobility that can be achieved with the MEB [electric drive matrix] within the Volkswagen brand. But we want to open up the platform for third-party suppliers”, said Ralf Brandstätter, COO of the Volkswagen brand.“The transformation of the Volkswagen brand is in full swing. We are making excellent progress in the areas of digitalisation of our company and the electrification of our models,” Brandstätter added.Related: What’s Behind The Cobalt Price Crash?Volkswagen’s motto is “electric cars for millions, not for millionaires,” chief executive Herbert Diess says.



For all legacy auto makers venturing into EVs, Tesla will be the competitor to beat. Last week, Tesla said that the long-awaited US$35,000 Model 3 was now available.“Shifting all sales online, combined with other ongoing cost efficiencies, will enable us to lower all vehicle prices by about 6% on average, allowing us to achieve the $35,000 Model 3 price point earlier than we expected,” Tesla said last week.“Base Model 3 available in Europe in ~6 months, Asia 6 to 8 months. Latter contingent on Shanghai Gigafactory. Country-specific taxes & import duties mean price may be 25% or more above US number,” Elon Musk tweeted last week. A few days later, Musk teased a Model Y unveil event on March 14. Being an SUV, Model Y “will cost about 10% more & have slightly less range for same battery,” Musk noted.

The Russian accounts of Venezuela’s state oil company PDVSA and all other Venezuelan companies will be moved to a Russian bank that is sanctioned by the United States, Russia’s RIA Novosti news agency reported, citing two sources familiar with the plans.Russia is the staunchest supporter of Nicolas Maduro’s regime in the political power struggle in the Latin American country sitting on top of the world’s largest oil reserves, while the U.S. and many European nations have recognized Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó as the legitimate interim president. Russia has stood by Maduro for years and has poured billions of U.S. dollars in Venezuela in the form of loans and oil investments in joint ventures.The Russian authorities have decided to move the Russian accounts of Venezuelan firms to the Russian Financial Corporation Bank (RFC Bank) after they held consultations with Venezuela and the businesses, according to RIA Novosti’s sources.



“RFC will become the main bank for servicing all Venezuelan business, most of all, PDVSA,” one of the sources told the Russian news agency.The U.S. Treasury imposed sanctions on RFC Bank in April 2018, because the bank is a subsidiary of state-owned Russian weapons trading company Rosoboroneksport. The U.S. sanctions on RFC Bank came along with the designation of seven Russian oligarchs and 12 companies they own or control, including Oleg Deripaska, and 17 senior Russian government officials.Russia’s Gazprombank has frozen accounts held by PDVSA and has stopped conducting transactions involving these accounts on concern of getting penalized under the latest round of U.S. sanctions against PDVSA, Reuters reported last month, quoting an unnamed source at Gazprombank.



The Venezuelan state oil firm was quick to describe the report as “fake news” on Twitter.Yet Reuters’ reporters note that Russian companies are wary of falling under secondary sanctions for doing direct business with PDVSA, despite the Kremlin’s official support for the Maduro government.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Vietnam’s Energy Dilemma Is About To Become A CrisisOil Majors Are Taking Over The PermianRussia To Defend Its Venezuela Oil Assets In ‘Toughest Way Possible’

ExxonMobil expects its earnings to grow by more than US$4 billion from 2019 to 2020, the U.S. supermajor said in its Investor Day presentation on Wednesday.In 2018, Exxon booked earnings of US$20.8 billion, up by 6 percent compared to 2017. Despite weaker margins in the downstream and the drop in oil prices in Q4, Exxon’s full-year 2018 cash flow from operating activities jumped to US$36 billion from US$30 billion for 2017. The 2018 cash flow from operations was the highest since 2014, the company said.  According to today’s presentation, Exxon expects its earnings, cash flow, and return profile to grow in coming years even in a flat price environment. Cash flow is expected to also continue to increase, by more than US$5 billion from 2019 to 2020, the company says.



In the upstream, Exxon will focus on five “outstanding” developments—the Permian in the shale business, Guyana and Brazil in deepwater, and Papua New Guinea and Mozambique in liquefied natural gas (LNG).For the Permian specifically, Exxon expects robust earnings growth, even with oil prices at $40 a barrel.A day before the Investor Day presentation, Exxon said on Tuesday that it had revised up its Permian growth plans, expecting to produce more than 1 million oil-equivalent barrels per day by as early as 2024, which would be an increase of almost 80 percent. The doubling of Exxon’s Permian production in 2018 has increased the company’s confidence in its growth plans, it said.



Exxon expects its investments in the Permian to produce double-digit returns, even at low oil prices. At oil price at $35 a barrel, for example, Permian production will have an average return of more than 10 percent, Exxon said, noting that it is also building infrastructure to support production growth and takeaway capacity.“These investments support growth plans and ensure that as production levels continue to rise, we are well positioned in processing and transportation capacity,” Neil Chapman, ExxonMobil senior vice president, said in a statement.  By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Bezos, Bloomberg And Gates Back Revolutionary Exploration TechSupertanker Rates Soar As U.S. Oil Exports Hit All-Time High$70 Oil Is Right Around the Corner

China’s biggest refiner Sinopec is preparing to ink a 20-year LNG supply deal with Cheniere Energy if the U.S.-China trade conflict gets resolved as many in the energy market anticipate, Reuters reports, citing unnamed sources close to the deal.“Without the trade spat, the deal should have been signed some time ago,” one of the sources said. Both said the deal would be for almost 2 million tons of LNG annually, beginning in 2023. This will be a sizeable portion of the total U.S. liquefied natural gas capacity as of end-2019. The Energy Information Administration last December forecast this would reach 8.9 million tons.According to Reuters calculations, the size of the deal based on January prices for U.S. LNG coming into China would come in at US$16 billion.



Last month, Reuters reported Chinese LNG imports had hit another high in January amid peak seasonal demand, at 6.55 million tons. However, the winter turned out milder than would justify this massive intake of LNG and many importers were stranded with more LNG than they can’t sell.“When people see these numbers, they think Chinese demand is up ... but actually it is causing a headache (for importers) as (they) have overbought and can’t find demand to absorb the cargoes,” one energy industry source told Reuters at the time.If the U.S.-China trade war ends with a mutually agreeable deal, this would mean a lot not just for established exporters such as Cheniere, but for newcomers on the market who need funding to build their export terminals. To get it from banks, however, they need long-term delivery commitments and these have become hard to come by amid the trade dispute.

Mexico will lose billions as a result of the new government’s decision to delay oil and gas auctions while it reviews all contracts awarded by the previous government over the three years since it began holding auctions for oil and gas blocks.""Every year you don't have a bidding, it's going to cost you $1 billion,"" said a commissioner from Mexico’s hydrocarbons commission, Hector Moreira Rodriguez, as quoted by S&P Global Platts.Yet the losses would not just be directly financial. A delay in tenders will also interfere with President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador’s plans to boost Mexico’s oil production to 2.4 million bpd by 2024. According to Rodriguez, with the delay, the country’s crude oil production will grow by 300,000 bpd less over the next ten years than otherwise.



Mexico’s current oil production stands at about 1.84 million bpd, of which 60 percent is exported. Production has been falling steadily and the tenders organized by the previous government were instrumental in reversing the decline.Now the government is reviewing more than 100 contracts for signs of corruption. It has also had to bail out Pemex, which has turned the company into the most indebted in the world with the load at US$107 billion. Last month, Obrador announced a US$5.5-billion rescue package for the company, including US$3.9 billion in a direct cash injection and US$16 billion in guaranteed revenues.Yet, according to industry insiders who talked to S&P Global Platts, even if the auctions are renewed before all contracts are reviewed, chances are Mexico will not be able to reach its production growth goals.



The reasons for this are natural depletion at legacy fields and an insufficient number of new discoveries. This should make the resumption of auctions all the more necessary if anything, especially coupled with the government’s ambition to reduce the country’s reliance on imported natural gas from the United States.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Oil Majors Are Taking Over The PermianBezos, Bloomberg And Gates Back Revolutionary Exploration TechSupertanker Rates Soar As U.S. Oil Exports Hit All-Time High

The American Petroleum Institute (API) reported a large surprise build in crude oil inventories of 7.29 million barrels for the week ending March 1, coming in way over analyst expectations that predicted that crude oil inventories would build by 388,000 barrels.Last week, the API reported a surprise draw in crude oil of 4.2 million barrels. A day later, the EIA reported a larger one of 8.6 million barrels. Oil price movements were flat on Tuesday prior to the data release, with the WTI benchmark at 12:45 pm EST trading essentially flat on the day (-0.02%) at $56.58, about $1 over last week levels. The Brent benchmark, similarly, was trading perfectly flat at $65.67, less than $0.50 above last week’s levels.While 2019 has been a wild ride for oil prices, inventory moves for crude have been innocuous, with a net draw of just over 4 million barrels for the nine reporting periods prior to this week, using API data.

Azerbaijan’s state oil firm SOCAR is ramping up production at its new refinery in Turkey and is actively buying sour crude grades for the facility, additionally tightening the already tight sour crude market in the Mediterranean and Europe, crude traders and sources tell Reuters.SOCAR’s oil refinery STAR is designed to have a processing capacity of 200,000 bpd, and it has already reached half that planned capacity, sources familiar with the refinery start-up told Reuters.Full capacity could be reached as soon as next month, and SOCAR is actively buying Russia’s Urals sour crude grade at a time when supply of sour and heavy crudes in the Mediterranean and Europe is tightening.



OPEC’s production cuts and the U.S. sanctions on Venezuela and Iran have been limiting the availability of heavy and sour crude grades to Europe, where prices for sour and heavier grades, including Russia’s Urals, have recently shot up amid an increasingly tightening market.The U.S. sanctions on Iran had already limited some of the heavy grade supply into Europe. Then with the new round of OPEC/non-OPEC cuts that began in January, Iraq’s Basra Light and Heavy—typically very popular among European refiners—have also been in short supply on the spot market in Europe as Iraq is diverting more barrels of Basra to the premium market for Middle Eastern producers: Asia.  To top off the sanctions on Iran and the OPEC cuts, the U.S. sanctions on Venezuela at the end of January further tightened the heavy crude market in Europe, and traders expect the market to tighten even more in the coming months.



The sanctions on Venezuela and on Iran, as well as OPEC’s cuts, have led to a huge imbalance between light sweet grades and heavy sour grades, especially in Europe, as Middle Eastern and other oil producers are targeting to keep their sales on the Asian market.Due to tighter supply of medium and heavy sour crude oil, Middle Eastern benchmarks for sour crude grades traded higher than Brent Crude prices at the beginning of February in a rarely seen development in global oil prices.

China is currently holding around 1,600 Tesla Model 3s at the customs in Shanghai and the customs authority has issued a notice prohibiting the sale of any Model 3 already imported in China because some vehicles have been found to lack proper labeling to make them legal on the Chinese market, financial outlet Caixin reported on Tuesday.  Some of the Model 3s lacked labels in Chinese on their brake fluid tanks, while others had capacities different from the ones stated on the label, Caixin reported, citing China’s General Administration of Customs (GAC).As a result of the improper labeling, the GAC has issued a notice banning the sale of any Tesla Model 3 in China until further inspections are carried out. New Model 3s entering China will also be thoroughly checked.



According to Caixin, Tesla said that the improper labeling resulted from “incorrect settings on its printers” and “workers’ poor operation.”The electric vehicle (EV) maker is currently working with the Chinese government to find a solution to the customs clearance procedures and the issues with labeling, Caixin reported.Related: OPEC Set To Push Back Oil Output Decision From April To JuneGAC has also invited third-party institutions to assess possible solutions to the issue, according to the financial publication.



Deliveries of Model 3 outside the United States will be a crucial development for Tesla, whose chief executive Elon Musk has said that he wasn’t worried about Model 3 setbacks because of the drop in the U.S. tax credit, as he expected deliveries to Europe and China to take off.In its Q4 Update letter, Tesla said that “In January 2019, we started to produce Model 3 vehicles for Europe and China, and the car is now fully certified for sale in these markets. The market opportunity for Model 3 in Europe and China exceeds North America based on the most recent sales of mid-sized premium sedans. Model 3 was designed from the outset for a global market, and shares more than 98% of its parts in common across its regional variants.” In February, Tesla said it would start selling Model 3 on the Chinese market ahead of schedule. Initially, the Model 3 release was scheduled for March.

The world and the oil and gas industry need to start tackling in earnest climate change, Spencer Dale, group chief economist at supermajor BP, told The Washington Post in an interview published on Tuesday.“All the climate arguments are real, urgent and important,” Dale told The Washington Post’s Dino Grandoni.The longer the industry and the world wait until they start addressing carbon emissions, the more “draconian” changes the global economy will see in the future, according to BP’s chief economist.



In its annual BP Energy Outlook published last month, BP said that renewable energy will be the fastest-growing source of energy in the world through 2040, penetrating the energy system “more quickly than any fuel in history” to become the largest source of power by 2040. Renewables are expected to account for some two-thirds of the rise in power generation globally, and their share in the global power sector will grow to around 30 percent by 2040, up from around 10 percent now, according to the BP Energy Outlook.Despite the forecast that peak oil demand could come in the 2030s, BP noted that under all scenarios oil will continue to play a significant role in the global energy system by 2040. Moreover, “significant levels of investment are required for there to be sufficient supplies of oil to meet demand in 2040,” BP said, adding that “In all scenarios, trillions of dollars of investment in oil is needed.” Related: Major Breakthrough Could “Turn Back The Emissions Clock”However, the outlook also noted that “Global carbon emissions continue to rise, signaling the need for a comprehensive set of policy measures to achieve a substantial reduction in carbon emissions.”



“Polices aimed at the power sector are central to achieving a material reduction in carbon emissions over the next 20 years…most of the low-hanging fruit in terms of reducing carbon emissions is outside of the transport sector,” Dale said in the press release accompanying the outlook’s launch.A few weeks before publishing the energy outlook, BP said that it would support a call from a group of institutional investors to expand its carbon emissions reporting and to describe how BP’s strategy is consistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement, in yet another pledge by Big Oil to start taking investor demands on climate action seriously.

Mexico will continue to need U.S. natural gas imports over the next decade, despite efforts by the new Mexican government to reduce dependence on American natural gas, data and analytics company GlobalData said in a report on Tuesday.  Currently, U.S. natural gas pipeline exports, mainly from Texas, look like a much more convenient option for Mexico than grappling with possible shortfalls of natural gas supply, according to GlobalData.“Without a comprehensive strategy that considers development of large natural gas resources, both onshore and offshore, it will be difficult to reduce the volume of imports demanded for power generation and industrial use,” the analytics firm said.



The Mexican government’s approach to domestic resource development would make it difficult for the country to reduce its energy dependence, because state-owned oil and gas firm Pemex has the dominant position over much of Mexico’s gas reserves, but lacks the capital to work by itself on capital-intensive gas development projects, GlobalData said. In addition, resource development could be further constrained because the Mexican government has halted the bidding rounds for the time being.Mexico is looking for ways to reduce its overwhelming dependency on U.S. natural gas imports, which currently satisfy over 50 percent of its demand. This is the highest foreign gas dependency rate in the world, according to a senior adviser to Mexico’s president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador.“In the short and mid-term, Mexico’s natural gas production decline could be alleviated by developing key upstream projects but this is unlikely given the current strategy led by the Mexican government,” GlobalData noted.



At the same time, U.S. natural gas pipeline exports to Mexico have been growing, thanks to expansion of cross-border pipeline capacity, the EIA has estimated. The rise of liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports and pipeline exports to Mexico resulted in the United States being a net natural gas exporter for the second year in a row in 2018. Exports of natural gas to Mexico by pipeline exceeded 5 Bcf/d in July 2018, the EIA said earlier this year.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:$70 Oil Is Right Around the CornerLower Buying Appetite May Jeopardize New LNG ProjectsActivist Investors Force Change In The Oil Industry

South Dakota’s governor, Kristi Noem, has proposed legislation seeking to uncover where out-of-state funds for pipeline protests come from and “cut them off at the source,” the Associated Press reports, adding Republican Noem also said she would set up a fund for extraordinary costs for law enforcement that usually accompany pipeline protests.“I’m a supporter of property rights, freedom of speech and freedom of assembly. We should celebrate differences of opinion. But here in South Dakota, we will have the rule of law, because rioters do not control economic development in our state,” Noem said.In response to the news, the policy director of the American Civil Liberties Union of South Dakota said such legislation may infringe of free speech.



The legislation has been triggered by the problems of neighbor North Dakota, which had to deal with a months-long protest against the Dakota Access pipeline back in 2016 and this cost the state tens of millions of dollars.North Dakota is the site of another controversial pipeline, the Keystone XL, which has had its fair share of protests and legal challenges. Last November, the project got the green light from a Montana judge to start doing some preliminary work while the State Department reviewed its original assessment of the environmental impacts of the project, as ordered by the court.Yet the same judge blocked all other activities around Keystone XL such as setting up worker camps along the route of the pipeline, which means the start of construction will once again be delayed even if TransCanada is lucky enough to emerge as the victor in the legal battle.



The 830,000 bpd, US$8-billion pipeline will run from the Albertan oil sands through Montana and South Dakota, ending in Nebraska, where it would connect to the existing pipeline network that goes on to the Gulf Coast. Yet like Dakota Access, Keystone XL has become a focal point for environmentalists arguing there are already more than enough oil pipelines in the United States and Canada.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:The Winners And Losers Of The Latest Commodity Rally$70 Oil Is Right Around the CornerGoldman: OPEC To Clear Supply Glut By April

Libya’s largest oil field, Sharara, is back in operation after almost three months of suspension, the Wall Street Journal reports, citing unnamed sources familiar with the situation.The field was originally closed for production in December, when clashes between militant groups forced the National Oil Corporation of Libya to institute a force majeure, which was only lifted yesterday.The groups that occupied Sharara in early December with demands for better economic conditions and power supply security. The occupation lasted until early February, when the Libyan National Army, a group affiliated with the eastern Libyan government, took control of the field. The force majeure remained in place as the NOC refused to yield to demands for payments, arguing this would set a dangerous precedent.



Then, however, the LNA faced the Petroleum Facilities Guard, an old adversary and a group loyal to the UN-recognized Libyan government. The situation was resolved only last week with mediation from the United Arab Emirates.According to NOC’s chairman, Mustafa Sanalla, the three-month blockade of the field had cost it US$1.8 million and 20,000 bpd in lost production capacity as a result of vandalism and looting.In a statement, the state oil company said the venture operating the field had ""received written assurance from the officials from the Libya National Army ""that all individuals subject to Public Prosecutor arrest warrant have been removed from the field and will not be readmitted to the site. Additional security measures for on-site staff are being implemented, with perimeter security and safe ""green zones"" a priority,""



Sharara has the capacity to pump 340,000 bpd, which is about a third of Libya’s total oil production when the field is in operation. This importance of Sharara has made it a frequent target for various groups and their grievances and ambitions, turning Libya into a swing producer despite its relatively low production rate of just above 1 million bpd before the latest Sharara outage.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:$70 Oil Is Right Around the CornerCanada’s Oil Patch Divided As Alberta Eases CutsOil Rises Amid Nigerian Oil Terminal Shutdown

OPEC will likely wait until June to decide how to proceed with the production cuts as the initially set date for review, April, could be too soon to assess how the cuts and the supply from exempted and sanctioned Iran and Venezuela would affect the oil market, Reuters reported on Monday, citing three OPEC sources.  OPEC and its Russia-led non-OPEC partners are implementing a new round of cuts of a total of 1.2 million bpd between January and June in an attempt to rebalance the oil market, which had tipped into oversupply in the latter half of 2018 when the Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies, together with Russia, ramped up production to compensate for what was expected to be a significant reduction of Iranian oil exports due to the U.S. sanctions.With the U.S. granting waivers to eight Iranian customers, the OPEC+ alliance found themselves having to grapple with another glut building, coupled with market fears of economic and oil demand growth slowdown.



When the partners decided to begin the new round of cuts, they said that the deal was subject to review in April.Now, according to Reuters’ OPEC sources, April could be too soon for a definitive decision to be made.Related: Activist Investors Force Change In The Oil IndustryThe key factors that OPEC will be watching in the next two months are how tight supply from Iran and Venezuela would be, considering that the current U.S. waivers expire in early May, while Venezuela’s production and exports are likely to further drop in the coming months as the political crisis there continues.



As things stand now, OPEC is likely to defer the decision from April to June and the likely scenario is to extend the agreement, the OPEC sources tell Reuters.“So far the likely decision is to extend the agreement in June. Nothing much is planned for April, just to discuss the OPEC and non-OPEC (cooperation pact),” one OPEC source told Reuters.Last week, Saudi Arabia’s Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih signaled that he was leaning toward an extension of the OPEC+ production cuts after June, although he noted that the producer group would take a measured approach not to tighten the oil market too much.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:$70 Oil Is Right Around the CornerCould This NASA Innovation Save The EV Industry?What’s Behind The Cobalt Price Crash?

Russia will speed up its oil production cuts this month and plans to reach its share of the OPEC/non-OPEC output reduction by end-March or early April, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said on Monday.There is an understanding that Russia will reach higher compliance levels in March, Novak said, as carried by Russian news agency TASS. At the end of March-early April, Russia will have reached the planned reduction, 228,000 bpd, Novak added.As part of the OPEC+ production cuts between January and June, Russia is taking the lion’s share of the non-OPEC cuts and pledged to reduce production by 230,000 bpd from October’s post-Soviet record level of 11.421 million bpd, to 11.191 million bpd.



Moscow, however, has repeatedly said that due to weather and geological conditions in the cold Russian winter, it cannot cut its oil production too quickly.In mid-January, Khalid al-Falih, the energy minister of Saudi Arabia—the OPEC kingpin and key Russian ally in all OPEC/non-OPEC production policy deals since early 2017—had said that Russia was moving with the cuts “slower than I’d like.”Referring to Russia’s share of the cuts, Novak said last month that as of February 14, the country had reduced its production by 80,000 bpd-90,000 bpd from October’s levels. Novak said last month that the Russian companies would try to accelerate the cuts to reach the target by April.



Last Friday, the minister held a meeting with Russia’s oil companies to discuss the cuts and the situation on the oil market.Russia is fully complying with its pledges to gradually reduce production, Novak said, as carried by the Russian energy ministry. In February, Russia cut its oil production by around 97,000 bpd compared to October levels, and as of end-February, the country had cut a total of 118,000 bpd compared to October 2018, the energy minister said on Friday.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Asian LNG Prices Continue To TumbleBe Wary Of Unrealistic Shale Growth ExpectationsOil Rises Amid Nigerian Oil Terminal Shutdown

Tesla owners have staged protests outside Tesla stores and Superchargers in some parts of Asia after the electric vehicle (EV) maker announced last week massive price cuts, which means that existing customers for some models in some counties have paid by up to 40 percent more for buying their Teslas before the price reduction.In Taiwan, for example, a Model S P100D now costs about half the price than it used to just a week ago, Electrek reports.The price cuts that Tesla announced last week alongside the availability of the US$35,000 Tesla Model 3 will be welcome news for new buyers, but existing customers in Taiwan and in China feel that those massive price reductions have been unfair to previous customers.



“I received Tesla’s Model X on February 25, and I only drove this car for five days before Tesla announced a price reduction of 174,300 yuan ($25,989.87). I’m probably the most unlucky new buyer ... That’s unfair,” China’s Global Times quoted a user on Chinese social media as saying.According to analysts who spoke to Global Times, Tesla’s frequent price changes in China would affect its sales on the world’s biggest EV market because customers could wait for more price reductions and hope for a locally produced Model 3 to roll out.Last week, Tesla said that the long-awaited US$35,000 Model 3 was now available, but in order to “remain financially sustainable”, Tesla is shifting sales worldwide on online sales only, meaning it would be closing down stores.



“Shifting all sales online, combined with other ongoing cost efficiencies, will enable us to lower all vehicle prices by about 6% on average, allowing us to achieve the $35,000 Model 3 price point earlier than we expected,” Tesla said last week.“Base Model 3 available in Europe in ~6 months, Asia 6 to 8 months. Latter contingent on Shanghai Gigafactory. Country-specific taxes & import duties mean price may be 25% or more above US number,” Elon Musk said last week.   By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:What’s Behind The Cobalt Price Crash?Activist Investors Force Change In The Oil IndustryOPEC Chief: U.S. Shale Helped Avert Total Chaos In Oil Markets

Norway’s Equinor said on Monday that it had made an oil discovery in the North Sea that could be quickly tied in to existing infrastructure—one of the company’s goals in exploration drilling in the more mature areas offshore Norway.The Telesto exploration well on the Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS) in the North Sea found oil and resources are estimated at 12-28 million barrels of recoverable oil, said Equinor, which operates the acreage in partnership with Petoro, ConocoPhillips, and Repsol.“These are profitable barrels that can be quickly tied in to existing infrastructure and generate substantial revenues for society. Infrastructure-led exploration is an important part of our roadmap for the NCS,” said Nick Ashton, Equinor’s senior vice president for exploration in Norway and the UK.



“We have set ourselves an ambitious goal of sustaining high production from the NCS for decades, and discoveries like this are essential towards this end. It will be natural to tie in the resources to the Visund A platform,” Gunnar Nakken, Equinor’s senior vice president for Operations West, said.Despite cost controls, increased efficiency, and higher activity offshore Norway, oil production at Western Europe’s largest oil producer fell in 2018 compared to 2017 and is further expected to drop this year to its lowest level since 1988.Norway’s oil production is expected to jump in 2020 through 2023, thanks to the start up in late 2019 of Johan Sverdrup—the North Sea giant, as operator Equinor calls it. With expected resources of 2.1 billion—3.1 billion barrels of oil equivalent, Johan Sverdrup is one of the largest discoveries on the NCS ever made.



However, after Johan Sverdrup and after Johan Castberg in the Barents Sea scheduled for first oil in 2022, Norway doesn’t have major oil discoveries and projects to sustain its oil production after the middle of the 2020s.The Norwegian Petroleum Directorate (NPD) started warning last year that from the mid-2020s onward, production offshore Norway will start to decline “so making new and large discoveries quickly is necessary for maintaining production at the same level from the mid-2020s.”  By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:What’s Behind The Cobalt Price Crash?Oil Rises Amid Nigerian Oil Terminal ShutdownActivist Investors Force Change In The Oil Industry

A rapid rise in subsea tree installations is projected for the global offshore industry in the coming years, as operators are poised to boost expenditure substantially on subsea equipment and installation.After activity levels fell to only 240 subsea trees installed globally in 2017 – the lowest level since the turn of the century – Rystad Energy forecasts that over 350 subsea trees will be installed per year by 2021.The market for subsea trees, or so-called Xmas trees, is expected to grow by 8% per year in the period 2017 to 2023. The UK and Norway will drive the growth through 2021, after which South America will take the lead.“As the oil price has recovered since 2016, the subsea market has shown clear signs of improvement.  Subsea tree installations can be seen as a main driver for this growth. We expect a substantial increase in demand in coming years,” said Rystad Energy analyst Henning Bjørvik.



(Click to enlarge)Global demand for oilfield services is projected to hit $642 billion in 2019, of which the subsea market will account for 4%. Three broad categories constitute the subsea market: Equipment; Services; and SURF (subsea umbilicals, risers and flowlines).Applying our base case oil price forecast, we expect the subsea market to increase significantly in the years to come, with an average annual growth of 10% in E&P spending for subsea equipment and installation from 2018 through 2023. Much of the growth is expected to come from the subsea equipment market (up 12% per year) and the SURF market (up 11% per year).Related: Reuters Survey: OPEC Oil Production Drops To Four-Year Low



“We now see a new wave of subsea developments in the coming years, supported by effective cost cutting measures and cooperation between suppliers and E&Ps,” Bjørvik added.Norway and the UK benefit from having well-established offshore infrastructure. Many marginal fields can draw advantages from their close proximity to existing facilities and can become commercially viable through subsea satellite developments. Of the projects exploration and production companies (E&Ps) are expected to commit to over the next four years in Norway and the UK, we expect 53% of the offshore greenfield E&P expenditure to be for subsea tie-back projects. This is a significant increase from 30% in the 2010-2018 period. Equinor, which is the second largest operator of subsea trees after Petrobras and has a large subsea portfolio, is expected to increase its subsea expenditure significantly during 2019, with as much as 93% of the spending being for projects on the Norwegian continental shelf. The majority of this expenditure is projected to be for subsea tie-backs.By Rystad EnergyMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Activist Investors Force Change In The Oil IndustryGlobal Oil & Gas Drilling Set To Surge In 2019The Latest News From Tesla Is A Game Changer

The Line 3 pipeline that operator Enbridge had scheduled to be replaced by the end of this year, will return to operation more than six months later, the company said after it announced that the state of Minnesota had given it the timeline for collecting all necessary permits for the replacement of the pipeline.he Line 3 Replacement Program is planned to fully replace 1,031 miles of Line 3 with new pipeline and associated facilities on either side of the Canada-U.S. international border. The U.S. portion of the program is from Neche, North Dakota, through Minnesota, to Superior, Wisconsin. The pipeline project envisages higher capacity and changes in routing in some parts, prompting opponents of the plan to argue that the replacement project is more like a new pipeline plan.



At the end of the second quarter of 2018, the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission approved the proposed replacement of Enbridge’s Line 3 pipeline despite the vocal environmentalist opposition. This opposition, however, prompted a vote by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission on whether it should review its decision to grant a certificate of need for the replacement project. The vote, taken in December, was unanimously in favor of the Line 3 replacement.Now, the commission has provided Enbridge with the period it needs to acquire all necessary permits to go ahead with the Line 3 replacement, and this period will run until the end of November this year, the company said. That’s quite a bit later than what Enbridge had anticipated: the company expected to get a timeline that ran until the end of June this year. As a result, the new Line 3 will only begin carrying oil some time in the second half of 2020.

The price of the Brent international crude oil benchmark dipped below two Middle Eastern benchmarks that represent heavier, sour grades, Reuters reports, citing industry sources.Based on light sweet crude grades produced in the North Sea, Brent has traditionally traded at a premium to sour grades with a higher sulfur content that have been typically considered sort of lower quality than light sweet blends that yield higher amounts of fuels such as gasoline.However, heavy crude blends are essential for the production of middle distillates used for other types of fuels, including bunkering fuel, where a seismic change is coming next year: the International Maritime Organization is implementing stricter sulfur emission rules that will require refiners to adjust their production accordingly. Still this adjustment does not meant demand for heavy crude will fall. In fact, it is expected to rise.



At the same time, OPEC is cutting the production of its heavier grades in its efforts to prop up prices. This, added to the latest round of U.S. sanctions against Venezuela’s PDVSA and Iran, has begun to tighten heavy crude supply and has become the reason for what may seem an unnatural price difference for light and heavy crude.Related: Will Trump Take Action Against OPEC?Yet this difference is not very high for now. According to data from S&P Global Platts, the average price for Brent crude in February stood at US$64.032 a barrel while the average for the heavier Dubai was US$64.575 a barrel and the average for the Oman benchmark was US$64.681 a barrel.If the supply of heavy crude globally continues to tighten, the discount of Brent to heavier blends could deepen. It is still uncertain, however, if things play out this way. OPEC is meeting next month to discuss progress on its latest round of cuts but it’s anyone’s guess if these will be extended, especially with Russian oil companies and notably Rosneft not particularly happy with the new cuts.



Meanwhile, Venezuela’s president Nicolas Maduro is holding on despite mounting pressure from the United States to cede the top office in the country, so Venezuelan crude supply will likely continue to be tight for the next few months at least. Iran sanctions are also unlikely to go away anytime soon, adding to pressure on heavy crude supply.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:BP CEO Dudley: U.S. Shale Is ‘A Market Without A Brain’Saudi Arabia Aims To Become Large Natural Gas ExporterIs U.S. Oil Returning To China?

TransCanada said on Friday that the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) had approved the full in-service of the Mountaineer XPress natural gas pipeline project, which will help link the Appalachian basin’s natural gas supplies and growing markets in the U.S. and beyond.The Mountaineer XPress (MXP) project includes a 170-mile natural gas pipeline in West Virginia that will increase natural gas capacity by 2.7 billion cubic feet per day and together with related infrastructure—new compressor stations and modifications to existing compressor stations—represents a total investment of US$3.2 billion.The approval of the full in-service of Mountaineer XPress will allow TransCanada to start partial in-service of its Gulf XPress Project, a network of seven new compressor stations in Kentucky, Tennessee, and Mississippi, which will significantly increase the reach of low-cost, U.S.-produced natural gas from the Appalachian Basin. Investment in Gulf XPress is some US$600 million, according to TransCanada.



The start of the Gulf XPress project includes placing into service four new compressor stations located in Kentucky, Tennessee, and Mississippi, which are expected to provide additional capacity of 530,000 million cubic feet of natural gas per day on the Columbia Gulf Transmission System. Gulf XPress is expected to begin full service in the coming weeks, TransCanada said in a statement.Both the Gulf XPress and the Mountaineer XPress are underpinned by long-term contracts with customers, the Canadian pipeline operator noted.“Mountaineer XPress and Gulf XPress are extremely important to TransCanada as they provide much-needed takeaway capacity for our customers, while also growing our extensive footprint in the Appalachian Basin,” TransCanada President and CEO Russ Girling said.



In mid-February, TransCanada said it had revised upward its project costs for the Mountaineer XPress project to US$3.2 billion, due to delays in regulatory approvals from FERC and other agencies, higher contractor costs due to unusually high demand for construction resources in the region, inclement weather during construction, and changes in contractor work plans to mitigate delays. By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com: Oil Prices Could Soar On Trade War TruceBP CEO Dudley: U.S. Shale Is ‘A Market Without A Brain’Saudi Arabia Aims To Become Large Natural Gas Exporter

Shell is facing prosecution from the Dutch authorities over its acquisition of an offshore oil and gas block in Nigeria a few years ago, Reuters reports. The Anglo-Dutch supermajor is already a defendant in a trial for the same deal in Italy.The 2011 acquisition of block OPL 245 in Nigeria by Shell and Eni, according to Italian and Nigerian prosecutors, involved a transfer of money to personal accounts held by the Nigerian oil minister at the time. The official, Dan Etete, was later convicted of money laundering by a French court in a separate, unrelated case.The sum of the OPL 245 deal was US$1.3 billion, an investigation revealed, of which US$1.1 billion was used to bribe politicians and businessmen to secure the deal. Shell and Eni have insisted they were unaware of any wrongdoing at the time.



“Based on the preliminary criminal investigation, public prosecutors concluded that there are prosecutable offences,” Reuters quoted a spokeswoman for the Dutch prosecution authorities as saying.The Dutch prosecutors add pressure on the supermajor, which is also being targeted by the Nigerian authorities for unpaid taxes, media reported earlier this month.Nigeria has demanded that several international oil companies that operate in the country pay about US$20 billion in taxes they owed to local states. Among them, in addition to Shell, are Total, Chevron, and again Italy’s Eni.



Shell is the largest investor in Nigeria among these companies and has denied it owed any tax payments. The company also said it will dispute the government’s demand, adding the affair would delay the start of expanded production at one of Nigeria’s largest fields, Bonga.Separately, a trial about OLP 245 is due to begin at the end of this month in Nigeria. This case, brought to the court by a human rights organization—Human and Environmental Development Agenda—seeks the revoking of the license for OPL 245 citing transparency and accountability problems with the process that led to its issuance.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Is This The End Of A Record-Breaking Oil Rally?Will Trump Take Action Against OPEC?Is U.S. Oil Returning To China?

With Canadian crude oil prices climbing higher, the Alberta government loosened the production cut imposed at the beginning of January by 100,000 bpd and has plans to further relax it next month. This month, local producers can extract 3.66 million bpd of heavy crude.“A short-term production limit is not ideal or sustainable, which is exactly why we have a plan to move more oil by rail in the coming months while we fight for the long-term solution of building pipelines to new markets,” Premier Rachel Notley said, also acknowledging that the cuts had served their purpose: “The decision to temporarily limit production was applied fairly and equitably, and our plan is working to stop allowing our resource to be sold for pennies on the dollar.”



However, the lower cuts of 95,000 bpd that Notley announced in December will likely stay in place as planned until the end of the year. The purpose of the initial, higher cuts, of 325,000 bpd, was to reduce the inventory overhang, which has now fallen to a more manageable level and the discount of Western Canadian Crude to West Texas Intermediate has narrowed substantially. Last year, the discount at one point exceeded US$50 a barrel. Now, it is in the single digits.This latter fact, however, has had some analysts worried that refiners will start seeking cheaper alternatives to Canadian crude. What’s more, one Scotiabank analyst said the production cut had already affected the profitability of oil-by-rail transportation in a negative way and the discount had to widen again to make this way of transporting crude profitable again.



""The curtailment has either taken initially too much oil or took it off the market too quickly,"" Rory Johnston told CBC this week. Alberta’s government, pressed for oil transport capacity, earlier announced it would buy 4,400 rail cars to ship more oil by rail as new pipelines have yet to be built if at all.

A tanker capable of carrying up to 600,000 barrels of oil is discharging U.S. Eagle Ford crude oil into China’s eastern port of Qingdao on Friday, Reuters reported, quoting Refinitiv ship-tracking data and trade sources, in what would be the first Chinese import of American crude oil in months.The Aframax tanker the Kara Sea is discharging the light crude Eagle Ford in the Chinese port, after the U.S.-origin oil had been transferred to the Kara Sea tanker from supertanker Olympic Luck, Refinitiv analyst Emma Li told Reuters.The Kara Sea has been chartered by BP and the receiver of the Eagle Ford crude is independent Chinese refiner Hongrun Petrochemical based in the Shandong province, Refinitiv’s analyst said.



According to Reuters, the cargo of Eagle Ford will likely be included in China’s February import volumes by the Chinese customs.Other ship-tracking data suggest that U.S. crude oil appears to be heading to China after many months of China abstaining from buying American oil amid the trade dispute, despite the fact that crude oil is not on Beijing’s tariff list.China could soon import crude oil directly shipped from the United States,  CNBC reported earlier this week, citing tanker-tracking data from ClipperData.



Although tanker-tracking data currently shows that a tanker is en route to a Chinese port, the final destination may yet change as the estimated time of arrival is the middle of April. In the past couple of months, other crude oil tankers heading to Asia were first thought to be en route to China but they later changed their final destination to other countries in the region.  According to ClipperData, a very large crude carrier (VLCC), Hong Kong Spirit, has recently loaded nearly 2 million barrels of U.S. oil at Moda Midstream’s Ingleside terminal near Corpus Christi, Texas. According to MarineTraffic, the current declared destination of the vessel is Yantai, China, with an estimated time of arrival on April 18.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Middle East Oil Kingdoms Grapple With New CrisisHas Trump Overplayed His Hand With Saudi Arabia?Saudi Aramco CEO Rebukes Peak Oil Demand ‘Hype’

Nicolas Maduro has ordered an office in Europe of Venezuela’s state oil firm PDVSA to be moved to Moscow, Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodriguez said on Friday after meeting with Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in the Russian capital.Russia is one of Maduro’s key supporters in the political power struggle in the Latin American country sitting on top of the world’s largest oil reserves, while the U.S. and many European nations have recognized Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó as the legitimate interim president.Russia has stood by Maduro for years and has poured billions of U.S. dollars in Venezuela in the form of loans and oil investments, even when all other Venezuelan allies—including China—have shown reluctance to continue lending money to Maduro’s regime.



After meeting with Russia’s Lavron today, Venezuela’s Executive Vice President Delcy Rodriguez said that “President Nicolas Maduro instructed the Lisbon branch of PDVSA to close this office and relocate the office to Moscow.” The relocation of PDVSA’s office is part of a broader agreement to boost cooperation with Russia’s giant energy companies Rosneft and Gazprom, Russian news agency TASS quoted Venezuela’s Rodriguez as saying.“This is done in line with our plans to expand technical cooperation in the oil production area with Rosneft, with Gazprom. The moment now is the most suitable to do so. We are changing the format of our relations,” Rodriguez said, as carried by TASS.



Speaking to the media on Friday, Lavrov said that he discussed with Rodriguez the situation in Venezuela, noting that the Latin American country is a “long-standing and reliable partner” of Russia. Russia reaffirmed its solidarity with the people of Venezuela and its legitimate government, and supported its efforts to defend its sovereignty and independence, Lavrov said, as carried by the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.Earlier this week, Russia’s Energy Minister Alexander Novak said that Russian companies in Venezuela were not experiencing any problems resulting from the escalation in the political situation in the country and had not incurred any losses on the oil they produce there.

Although China will continue to raise its liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports this year, the 2019 rise in the world’s key LNG demand growth market may not be enough to absorb all the new supply coming on stream over the next months.According to analysts at this week’s LNGgc Asia conference in Singapore, new demand this year would be lower than the expected new supply.Jason Feer, head of business intelligence at Poten & Partners, said that the company expected 33 million tons of new global LNG supply to hit the market this year, while demand is seen growing by just 16 million tons, Reuters columnist Clyde Russell writes.China will still see its LNG demand growing, but at a slower pace than the growth between 2017 and 2018.



China’s LNG imports reached a new record-high in January 2019, but as the winter heating period is coming to an end in mid-March, imports are expected to drop.At the same time, oversupply in Asia’s LNG market resulted in Asian spot LNG prices dropping again last week to the lowest since September 2017.China breakneck demand surge of the past two years is expected to slow down this year as Beijing is determined to avoid severe shortages by boosting pipeline connectivity, building more storage and import terminals, and raising domestic natural gas production.“Economic slowdown, a more considered approach on coal-to-gas switching and increased domestic infrastructure availability will mean LNG demand will slow in 2019, from the 40-45% growth we have seen in 2017 and 2018,” energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie said in its 2019 LNG outlook in early January.



“But China will still grow at around 20%, by far the largest source of LNG demand growth in the global market,” according to WoodMac.More LNG supply will be coming online this year, while a record LNG volume could reach final investment decision (FID). According to Wood Mackenzie, this year could be a record year for LNG projects approved, with more than 60 mmtpa of capacity likely FID. This would be well above the previous record of 45 mmtpa sanctioned in 2005 and triple the 21 mmtpa projects sanctioned last year.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Can Any Country Dethrone Qatar As Top LNG Exporter?One EV Maker Is Offering A Unique Solution To BlackoutsSaudi Arabia Oil Exports To U.S. Nosedive

Canada’s proposed legislation to amend the way major energy projects are being reviewed doesn’t work for oil-rich Alberta and risks exacerbating the oil industry’s troubles, Alberta’s Premier Rachel Notley said at a Senate committee hearing on Thursday.Alberta, the heart of the Canadian oil industry, has been grappling with takeaway capacity constraints, because major proposed oil pipelines have been either scrapped or stalled for years. Alberta even resorted to a mandatory short-term oil production cut in the oil patch to lift the price of Canadian oil, which had dropped to record lows in the fall of 2018.Alberta has also argued for the Trans Mountain pipeline project expansion, which has been stalled due to fierce opposition, various court claims, and reassessments.



The Canadian government’s Bill C-69, designed to change the environmental approval process of major projects, has become a controversial proposed legislation. Supporters argue that indigenous people would be properly consulted, while opponents say that increased government powers could lead to vetoes even before a project review begins.  “Changing the way Canada approves infrastructure projects is long over-due but, unless it’s fixed, Bill C-69 is just another broken system replacing the old one,” Alberta’s Premier Notley tweeted before the Senate hearing today.A day before the hearing, Notley said she would propose several amendments to the current draft legislation, such as excluding existing projects, pipelines, and in-situ facilities from additional oversight, and considering and evaluating the socio-economic benefits of a project.



“Ottawa just doesn’t get it. They don’t understand Alberta – and what this province contributes to the national economy and the well-being of all Canadians. I will make the case as clearly as I can that Bill C-69, in its current form, doesn’t work for Alberta. And, therefore, it does not work for Canada,” Notley said.ill C-69 is far from becoming a law—it is currently being reviewed by the Senate Committee on Energy, Environment and Natural Resources. The committee could propose amendments to the text after hearing experts and stakeholders.

The U.S. Department of Energy plans to sell up to 6 million barrels of crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR), with deliveries taking place in April and May, the Department of Energy said on Thursday.DOE plans to draw down and sell crude oil from three SPR sites—Bryan Mound and Big Hill in Texas, and West Hackberry in Louisiana. The Department of Energy announced today a notice for a price-competitive sale of up to 3 million barrels from Bryan Mound, up to 1.5 million barrels from Big Hill, and up to 1.5 million barrels from West Hackberry.DOE will award contracts to successful offers no later than March 15, 2019.



The sale is part of the law that authorizes the Secretary of Energy to draw down and sell up to US$2 billion of SPR crude oil for fiscal years 2017 through 2020, to carry out an SPR modernization program. In fiscal year 2019, the Secretary is authorized to sell up to US$300 million worth of crude oil from the SPR to carry out the SPR Life Extension Phase II project as part of the modernization program.Related: BP CEO Dudley: U.S. Shale Is ‘A Market Without A Brain’Although the sale does not appear to be aimed at easing possible supply concerns, deliveries will be taking place around the time in which the U.S. waivers for Iran’s oil customers to continue importing Iranian oil will expire in early May. Venezuela’s oil exports are also likely to have further dropped by that time due to the U.S. sanctions on its oil industry.At the end of January, reports emerged that the U.S. Administration was considering tapping the SPR as it imposed the sanctions on Venezuela. However, as Reuters noted, the reserve mostly lacks heavy crude similar to the grades that Venezuela typically exports.



Sales from the SPR would likely have little effect on the global oil market and the U.S. didn’t tap the reserve before the sanctions on Iran returned. “If you look at the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and you were to introduce it into the market, it has a fairly minor and short-term impact,” Secretary of Energy Rick Perry said in September, a month and a half before the U.S. sanctions on Iran kicked in.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Oil Inches Higher Ahead Of Inventory DataSaudi Oil Production Lags Behind Peers In The Mid-EastHydrogen Cars Struggle To Compete With Electric Vehicles

The U.S. carbon dioxide emissions reduction over the past decade has been the largest cut in emissions in the history of energy, Dr. Fatih Birol, the Executive Director of the International Energy Agency (IEA), said at a press conference in Washington D.C. on Thursday.“In the last 10 years, the emissions reduction in the United States has been the largest in the history of energy,” Birol said at a joint press conference with U.S. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry.“Almost 800 million tons, and this is a huge decline of emissions,” the IEA’s executive director noted.



As per latest available IEA data, global energy-related CO2 emissions rose by 1.4 percent to reach a historic high in 2017, the first increase in emissions after three years of global emissions remaining flat. However, carbon emissions growth last year was not universal, with emissions in major advanced economies, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and Japan, declining. The biggest decline in 2017 came from the United States, mainly because of higher deployment of renewables, according to the IEA.The U.S. emissions reduction over the past decade has been chiefly due to natural gas-fired electricity capacity displacing coal-fired power plants thanks to the U.S. shale boom. Rising renewable energy deployment across the U.S. has also helped to cut carbon emissions.“Like Dr. Birol has said many times, without carbon capture, any planned climate target is impossible to meet,” Secretary Perry said at the press conference.



“We believe that you can’t have a serious conversation about reducing emissions without including nuclear energy and carbon capture technology,” said Secretary Perry on the day on which he also announced the selection of eight projects to receive nearly US$24 million in federal funds for cost-shared research and development (R&D) for ‘Novel and Enabling Carbon Capture Transformational Technologies.’The selected projects will focus on the development of technologies to address scientific challenges and knowledge gaps associated with reducing the cost of carbon capture, the Department of Energy said.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Oil Prices Could Soar On Trade War TruceSaudi Aramco CEO Rebukes Peak Oil Demand ‘Hype’Middle East Oil Kingdoms Grapple With New Crisis

In the latest installment of long-running corruption investigation Operation Car Wash, an ex-oil trader for Brazil’s state energy giant Petrobras has agreed to plead guilty to charges of money laundering at a U.S. district court, Reuters reports, citing court documents.The scandal was the biggest in Brazil’s history and led to the impeachment of President Dilma Rousseff and prison sentences for high-ranking business executives from various industries. The large-scale investigation revealed that Petrobras and other companies—including commodity trading heavyweights Vitol, Trafigura, and Glencore—took part in a scheme that involved syphoning funds from Petrobras, among others, through fake business deals, with a lot of the money ending up in political party coffers.



The trader that struck the guilty pleas bargain, Rodrigo Garcia Berkowitz, is among a dozen former Petrobras employees who were two months ago charged by the Brazilian authorities with taking part in the scheme by offering the commodity trading houses lower prices for crude oil and services, and then distributed what was saved amongst themselves.Berkowitz and the others are liable for money laundering under U.S. law because the investigation revealed money for bribes to Petrobras executives was transferred to bank accounts in the U.S., Great Britain, Sweden, Switzerland, and Uruguay.



Operation Car Wash hit Petrobras especially hard as the first revelations coincided with the oil price crash from 2014. As a consequence, the company ended up saddled with the highest debt load in the global oil industry, at some $120 billion.Since then, Petrobras has been working to turn things around, helped by higher oil prices but mainly through an ambitious divestment program. This has not been going all too smoothly as some of the planned deals were suspended by the Supreme Court, but the suspensions have been temporary and Petrobras is now forging ahead with the debt-reduction plan.

As widely expected, ExxonMobil said on Thursday that it had made a natural gas discovery southwest off Cyprus, which Cypriot authorities hailed as the largest find offshore the eastern Mediterranean island to date.Exxon has been expected for a few weeks to announce that its drilling campaign offshore the southern coast of the divided island of Cyprus has resulted in a major gas discovery, potentially reigniting tension between Cyprus, Greece, and Turkey in the eastern Mediterranean.Turkey, which recognizes the northern Turkish Cypriot government and doesn’t have diplomatic relations with the internationally recognized government of Cyprus, claims that part of the Cyprus offshore area is under the jurisdiction of Turkish Cypriots or Turkey.



In a statement on Thursday, Exxon said that based on preliminary interpretation of data at the Glaucus-1 well, the natural gas discovery could represent an in-place natural gas resource of around 5 trillion to 8 trillion cubic feet (142 billion to 227 billion cubic meters).Glaucus-1 was the second of a two-well drilling program in Block 10 offshore Cyprus. The first well, Delphyne-1, did not encounter commercial quantities of hydrocarbons, Exxon said.“The potential for this newly discovered resource to serve as an energy source for regional and global markets will be evaluated further,” said Steve Greenlee, president of ExxonMobil Exploration Company.



The Energy Minister of Cyprus, Georgios Lakkotrypis, said, as carried by Reuters:“This is the biggest find so far in Cyprus, and based on some official data it is one of the biggest finds worldwide in the past two years.”  “ExxonMobil & QatarPetroleum make a world-class discovery offshore Cyprus at Glaucus. A high-quality reservoir 5-8 TCF of NatGas is added to the country’s reserves and demonstrates the emergence of the Republic’s EEZ as an alternative indigenous source of supply to the EU,” Lakkotrypis tweeted today.Last year in February, Eni and Total made a promising gas discovery offshore Cyprus that confirms that the Zohr-like play where Eni found the biggest gas deposit in the Mediterranean offshore Egypt extends into the Cyprus Exclusive Economic Zone.   By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Shale Growth Is Nearing An Inflection PointNatural Gas Prices To Remain Low… For NowUAE To Build World’s Largest Underground Oil Storage Facility

Production from the recently launched Egina deepwater field would remain outside Nigeria’s commitment to stick to OPEC’s production cuts, according to state-held Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC).“[I]t is not part of the volumes we look at,” NNPC Group’s Managing Director Maikanti Baru told Reuters on Thursday, asked if Egina’s production would count as crude oil or condensate.Nigeria currently produces around 1.8 million bpd of crude oil and another 400,000 bpd of condensate, NNPC’s manager said at an oil and gas conference in London.



“In terms of the OPEC quota, I think it’s not a cut in production, it’s to ensure we keep the quota. Of course the president said it and we will obey,” Reuters quoted Baru as saying, noting that the new field would be classified as condensate.Days before OPEC’s production cuts started on January 1, France’s Total had started up oil production from Nigeria’s ultra-deepwater oil field Egina, which is expected to pump 200,000 bpd at peak output.Total noted that the plateau production at the field of 200,000 bpd would account for some 10 percent of Nigeria’s oil production.



Nigeria, which wasn’t spared from the new OPEC/non-OPEC production cuts this time around, is expected to contribute with up to 40,000 bpd to the 800,000 bpd OPEC had pledged to cut from January, Nigerian Oil Minister Emmanuel Kachikwu told local news outlet THISDAY in December. The 40,000-bpd figure is some 2.5 percent of Nigeria’s current crude oil production of 1.7 million bpd, the minister said in the first half of December.In the official OPEC document released weeks after the new OPEC+ deal was struck, Nigeria’s share of the cuts is 53,000 bpd from the October 2018 level of 1.738 million bpd, to 1.685 million bpd for the period January-June 2019.  According to OPEC’s secondary sources, Nigeria’s crude oil production rose by 52,000 bpd from December 2018 to 1.792 million bpd in January 2019, despite Nigeria not being exempt from the OPEC cuts this time around.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Shale Growth Is Nearing An Inflection PointUAE To Build World’s Largest Underground Oil Storage FacilityNatural Gas Prices To Remain Low… For Now

The government of Queensland has approved the first large-scale natural gas project in almost a decade: the US$7.14-billion (A$10-billion) Surat LNG project led by a joint venture of Shell and China’s PetroChina, the Australian Financial Review reports.There is no certainty the project will go ahead, however, as the companies have yet to make a final investment decision on Surat. If it does go ahead, however, it will produce some 5,000 petajoules of energy for the domestic and export market. The reserves covered by the Shell/PetroChina lease for the project contain an estimated 5 trillion cu ft of natural gas.The chances of the project going ahead may be higher than a complete greenfield development since the joint venture, Arrow Energy, would use the existing infrastructure—pipelines and a gas processing plant—of another LNG project operated by Shell: Queensland Curtis LNG.



""This approach has two major benefits: it will get gas to the market faster and it significantly reduces the project footprint and the potential impact on local communities and the environment,"" the Queensland minister of mines said in a statement.The approval of this project is important in light of Australia’s east coast problems with energy shortage. In fact, earlier this week consultancy EnergyQuest said Australia will need to start importing natural gas to avoid a shortage on the east coast by 2022.The new Queensland LNG project is scheduled to begin production in 2020, but it would need pipelines if it is to be carried to the east coast of the country. The problem is particularly acute for New South Wales and Victoria, the EnergyQuest report said.



The gas shortage problem is not new. In fact, the federal government said it would impose export restrictions on LNG producers in the country in a bid to secure supply for the local market. However, this has evidently not been enough to change the situation.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Oil Prices Could Soar On Trade War TruceBP CEO Dudley: U.S. Shale Is ‘A Market Without A Brain’Saudi Arabia Aims To Become Large Natural Gas Exporter

Tesla’s chief executive Elon Musk changed his public Twitter name from Musk to Tusk as he lashed out at the Securities and Exchange Commission, which earlier this week approached a court with a complaint that Musk had violated a Twitter-related deal he struck with the regulator last year.Musk first drew the attention of the Securities and Exchange Commission last summer when the Tesla CEO said on Twitter that he was planning to take the company private and had already secured funding. It was this phrase, “funding secured”, that alerted the Securities and Exchange Commission, which launched a probe into this claim, prompting Musk to come forward with the revelation that he had for years been in talks with the Saudi sovereign wealth fund to take the company private.



Following hectic share price movements for Tesla, the SEC made Musk promise he would run any tweets that could affect the share price of Tesla by the company’s board of directors—the obligation that the watchdog now says Musk violated by tweeting that Tesla will produce half a million cars by the end of this year.The tweet that raised SEC’s hackles was followed by another one, which was seen as a belated attempt to reverse the damage by clarifying that “Meant to say annualized production rate at end of 2019 probably around 500k, ie 10k cars/week. Deliveries for year still estimated to be about 400k.”



A day after the SEC launched its compliant with a judge, Musk went back to Twitter to tell the world Tesla would be releasing some big news today at 2 pm. The tweet said simply “2 pm” and was followed by another one that said “California”, with Musk possibly opting for the laconic way in a bid to avoid further attention from SEC, which has made it perfectly clear it was not taking potentially price-moving tweets lightly.

One of the seven members on the governing panel of Mexico’s National Hydrocarbons Commission (CNH) has stepped down citing personal reasons halfway through his term, Reuters reports, adding this could give more power over the country’s oil industry to President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador.All commissioners from the National Hydrocarbons Commission are nominated by the president of the country and need to be approved by the Senate. In the last three months another two members of the commission have also resigned: its president, Juan Carlos Zepeda, who was nominated by the Pena Nieto government, left in November. In that same month another member of the regulator, Hector Acosta, left it to accept another government position.



At the time, Reuters recalls, these resignations caused worry that once elected, Obrador would hold a major sway over the energy regulatory body as he nominates for commissioners people close to him and his approach to the energy industry. This is actually why commissioners on the CNH serve terms that overlap but do not coincide with the terms of Mexico’s presidents, as a way of ensuring relative independence. Now that Obrador would get to nominate not one but three new commissioners, there may be some justification to the worry.Related: Saudis Leaning Toward OPEC Cut ExtensionAndres Manuel Lopez Obrador or AMLO as some media tend to refer to the Mexican president has made clear from the beginning the energy reform launched by the previous government is unlikely to survive long into his term. He ordered a review of all contracts with international oil companies signed by Pemex after the reform and has more recently suspended new joint ventures with foreign energy companies.



The new government wants the state to have more control over the country’s energy industry, which was in direct opposition to what the Pena Nieto government tried to do by opening up Mexico’s oil and gas reserves to public tenders in a bid to reverse a steady decline in oil and gas production. With Pemex deeply in debt, Obrador may need to reconsider his approach as he is unlikely top be on board with the idea of the government continually bailing out the state energy company with production still in decline.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Oil Prices Could Soar On Trade War TruceBP CEO Dudley: U.S. Shale Is ‘A Market Without A Brain’Saudi Arabia Aims To Become Large Natural Gas Exporter

The share of nuclear power generation in the global energy mix is set to decline through 2040 if there is no policy support to promote investment, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).“Nuclear energy plays a major role in both energy security and sustainability in today’s energy mix,” Dr Fatih Birol, the IEA’s Executive Director, said during a workshop on the role of nuclear power in the world’s clean energy system.“However without appropriate policy attention, its contribution will shrink, creating challenges for meeting our energy policy goals in the future,” Birol noted.The contribution of nuclear power to the global power mix in mature markets is set for a significant decline under current policy frameworks, as there are limited investments in new plants construction, the IEA said.



Under the Paris-based agency’s New Policies Scenario, nuclear power production grows as two developing economies, China and India, are responsible for more than 90 percent of net growth to 2040. However, outside of Japan, nuclear power generation in mature economies is seen dropping by 20 percent by 2040.“This decrease will be far greater if expected investments in plant life extension or new facilities do not take place,” the IEA said.In many countries, nuclear power has trouble competing against other, more economic alternatives, such as natural gas or modern renewables.“Concerns over safety and broader public acceptance also remain an obstacle to development,” the agency says.



According to the IEA’s Tracking Clean Energy Progress tracker on nuclear power, the latest available data shows that in 2017, new nuclear power capacity dropped sharply to only 3.6 GW. In addition, construction starts, a proxy for final investment decisions, remained low.“Declining investment, announced phase-out policies and planned retirements, combined with only 56 GW of nuclear capacity under construction in 2017, suggest that meeting the goal of 185 GW of net increase needed by 2030 will be very challenging,” according to the IEA.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Hydrogen Cars Struggle To Compete With Electric VehiclesThe $32 Trillion Push To Disrupt The Entire Oil IndustryAgainst The Odds, Big Oil Doubles Down On Megaprojects

China is set to announce this year the creation of a state-held oil and gas pipeline company, combining the midstream assets of the national firms in a bid to allow energy companies to focus on boosting exploration and production, Reuters reported on Wednesday, citing three people with knowledge of the plans.  Combining China’s pipeline infrastructure into one firm and opening access to this infrastructure to foreign and private producers would help the state oil and gas firms to focus on exploration at a time when China aims to increase its domestic production.China’s National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC)—the economic planning body—has already approved the plan for the major reshuffle, while the State Council has yet to issue a final approval, one of Reuters’ sources said.



The plan would be the biggest energy ‘reform’ in China since 1998 when the country restructured its oil and gas sector and created China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation, or Sinopec, and PetroChina, according to Reuters.A pipeline company would be a fourth major state energy firm, alongside Sinopec, PetroChina’s parent firm China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), and China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC).Of the current large energy companies, PetroChina will be the most affected by the plan because it currently controls 70 percent of the oil pipelines and almost 80 percent of the major gas pipelines.



PetroChina told Reuters in an email that it hopes that the plan for asset reshuffle would take place in “accordance with the principle of marketization” to address the company’s concern about how its pipeline assets would be valued. Lin Boqiang, an independent board member at PetroChina and Director of the Energy Economics Institute at Xiamen University, told Reuters that the pipeline asset reshuffle could set the stage for China to reform the dominance of Sinopec, PetroChina, and CNOOC over domestic exploration and let independent companies also explore for oil and gas.

Saudi Arabia’s oil giant Saudi Aramco targets to stop producing fuel oil at its refineries by 2024, as stricter environmental regulations for the shipping industry will significantly cut the largest source of demand for fuel oil, Abdulaziz M. Al-Judaimi, senior vice president of Downstream at Aramco, told S&P Global Platts in an interview published on Wednesday.The shipping industry is preparing for a major disruption of the types of fuels it will be using as early as the beginning of 2020, when stricter regulations for the sulfur content of fuel come into force. According to the new rules by the International Maritime Organization (IMO), only 0.5-percent or lower sulfur fuel oil should be used on ships beginning January 1, 2020, unless said ships have installed the so-called scrubbers—systems that remove sulfur from exhaust gas emitted by bunkers.Many ship owners are preparing for the new emission regulations and many ships will stop using fuel oil of above 0.5-percent sulfur content, thus sinking demand for the higher-sulfur fuel oil.



In 2017, Aramco produced 206,000 bpd of fuel oil at its fully owned refineries in Saudi Arabia, according to Platts.“[Some] 85% of our refining assets are IMO-compliant, meaning that we have 15% of our refining assets requiring further upgrades on the bottom of the barrel,” Al-Judaimi told Platts.Related: Natural Gas Prices To Remain Low… For NowYet, Aramco doesn’t expect a significant negative impact on its business from the IMO regulations, he said. 



“We have lined up all the investment needed to take the vacuum resid off the bottom of the barrel into distillates and gasoline as well as chemicals,” the manager noted.  While the Saudi oil giant plans to discontinue fuel oil production at its refineries, it has an ambitious plan to double its refining capacity and is heavily investing in refining and chemicals in pursuit of securing more downstream markets for its crude oil, Al-Judaimi said in the middle of 2018.Aramco, which produces around 10 million bpd of crude oil, aims to increase its refining capacity from 5 million bpd now to 8 million bpd-10 million bpd, and to double its petrochemicals production by 2030, Al-Judaimi said.    By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Oil Prices Could Soar On Trade War TruceVenezuela Fails To Sell Its Heavy Crude Amid Dwindling SupplyThailand Pivots To Renewables As Gas Dries Up

U.S. President Donald Trump is welcome to join a dialogue on balancing the global oil market, OPEC Secretary General Mohammad Barkindo told Reuters on Wednesday.Asked to comment on President Trump’s latest criticism of OPEC’s production cut policy, Barkindo told Reuters on the sidelines of an oil industry event in Riyadh that the United States, in its capacity of the world’s top oil producer, has a strategic stake in global supply and demand.On Monday, oil prices turned sharply lower after President Trump took to Twitter again to criticize OPEC and the high oil prices. President Trump tweeted: “Oil prices getting too high. OPEC, please relax and take it easy. World cannot take a price hike - fragile!”



Before Monday’s tweet, President Trump hadn’t tweeted about OPEC this year, after expressing hopes at the end of November that the Saudis and OPEC would not be cutting production again.OPEC and allies, however, agreed in early December to a new production cut deal for six months through June, with an option to review in April.After several heavy sell-offs in the fourth quarter last year, oil prices have regained some 20 percent so far in 2019, boosted by the cuts, but also by the U.S. sanctions on Iran and Venezuela, and more recently, by hopes that the U.S. and China might reach a trade deal.



While OPEC and its Russia-led allies have been looking for two years now at supply and demand and adjusting production to avoid a glut similar to the one that crashed oil prices in 2014, U.S. shale has been benefiting from the coordinated OPEC+ market action and the increase in oil prices over the past two years. Producers have been pumping record amounts of crude oil in the United States, which is already the world’s top oil producer ahead of Russia and Saudi Arabia.U.S. crude oil production hit a record 12 million bpd in the week ending February 15, rising by 100,000 bpd from 11.9 million bpd in the previous week, EIA data showed last week.  By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Saudis Leaning Toward OPEC Cut ExtensionBP CEO Dudley: U.S. Shale Is ‘A Market Without A Brain’Oil Inches Higher Ahead Of Inventory Data

Muhammadu Buhari, Nigeria’s president, has won a second term in office with a lead of over three million over opposition candidate Atiku Abubakar, who made some bold promises on the campaign trails, including a promise to Niger Delta communities that if he won they could keep all oil revenues generated by supermajors operating in Nigeria’s oil-rich region.The first Buhari term was marked by violence in the Delta by various militant groups that claimed they were attacking oil fields and infrastructure in response to the poverty that reigns in the region despite the billions of dollars made from oil production and exports.



The violence, coupled with more sort of traditional forms of vandalism such as oil theft from pipelines, created quite a few headaches for the Buhari government, leading to a serious slump in Nigeria’s total oil production and gravely affected the country’s export revenues as a result.However, in the past year or so the situation has improved somewhat. Violence is significantly less frequent these days after the oil ministry managed to negotiate a truce with most militant groups. Vandalism is still a serious problem, but steps are being made to rein in self-styled refineries who bought the crude stolen from the pipelines that crisscross the Delta. After for years chasing and closing them down, now the government is trying a new approach: making them legal.



In this context, many observers of the political situation in Nigeria warned that if Buhari lost this vote, the terms of agreements struck with militant groups and Delta communities by the Buhari government would need to be renegotiated and they might break down. So, for the oil industry the re-election of the incumbent in Nigeria’s presidency is good news.As for what the future holds, the restructuring and reform of the national oil company would likely continue to top the agenda as it has proven to be slower and more challenging than what its engineers initially may have expected.

Russian companies in Venezuela are not experiencing any problems resulting from the escalation in the political situation in the country and have not incurred any losses on the oil they produce there, Russia’s Energy Minister Alexander Novak told news outlet Gazeta.ru in an interview.“Our companies present there [in Venezuela] are following the situation very closely. To date, we have no information about any problems or losses. Work is going as usual,” Novak said.



Rosneft and Gazprom are among the foreign companies still present in Venezuela. Lukoil’s trading arm Litasco, however, exited the country as soon as the United States imposed the latest round of sanctions against the Maduro government, targeting specifically state oil company PDVSA.“Litasco does not work with Venezuela. Before the restrictions were imposed, Litasco had operations to deliver oil products and to sell oil. There were swap operations. Today there are none, since the sanctions were imposed,” Lukoil’s Alekperov said at the Russian Investment Forum in the Black Sea resort of Sochi earlier this month.



Another Russian oil producer, Gazprom Neft, however, does not see major risks for its oil business in Venezuela, the company’s chief executive officer Alexander Dyukov said at the same event two weeks ago.Russian and other companies, including U.S. Valery Energy and Chevron, operate in Venezuela via joint ventures with PDVSA. The heavy crude they produce, however, is sitting unsold as buyers shy away from the problematic commodity as Washington threatens sanctions.Just yesterday Bloomberg reported there are more than eight million barrels of crude produced in Venezuela that is sitting in tankers offshore because onshore storage facilities are getting filled up and the crude is not being sold. What’s more, because of this excess supply, heavy crude upgraders are operating at reduced rates in the Orinoco Belt, including an upgrader operated by the Rosneft PDVSA joint venture there.

The American Petroleum Institute (API) reported a surprise draw in crude oil inventory of 4.2 million barrels for the week ending February 22, coming in under analyst expectations that predicted that crude oil inventories would build by 2.842 million barrels.Last week, the API reported a build in crude oil of 1.26 million barrels. A day later, the EIA reported a larger one of 3.7 million barrels. Oil price movements were fairly bland on Tuesday prior to the data release, with the WTI benchmark trading essentially flat on the day at $55.48 while the Brent benchmark trading up $0.37 (+0.57%) at $65.28 at 2:25pm. Both benchmarks were trading down a couple dollars per barrel week on week.While 2019 has been a wild ride for oil prices, inventory moves for crude have been innocuous, with a net build of 147,000 barrels for the eight reporting periods prior to this week, using API data, with only two big swings that essentially cancelled each other out.



(Click to enlarge)The API this week reported a draw in gasoline inventories for week ending February 22 in the amount of 3.8 million barrels. Analysts estimated a draw in gasoline inventories of 1.686 million barrels for the week.US crude oil production as estimated by the Energy Information Administration showed that production for the week ending February 15—the latest information available—averaged 12 million barrels per day –another high for the US, breaking yet another psychological barrier.



Distillate inventories increased this week by 400,000 barrels, compared to an expected draw of 1.951 million barrels.Crude oil inventories at the Cushing, Oklahoma facility grew by 2.0 million barrels for the week.The U.S. Energy Information Administration report on crude oil inventories is due to be released on Wednesday at 10:30a.m. EST.By 4:39pm EST, WTI was trading up at $55.63 and Brent was trading up at $65.49.

Nigeria seeking nearly US$20 billion from international oil majors in back taxes could delay the approval of a major offshore oil project, Shell’s Upstream Director Andy Brown told Reuters on Tuesday.  Nigeria has asked the oil majors operating in the country to pay a total of almost US$20 billion in outstanding taxes and royalties that it says is owed to various Nigerian states, Reuters reported last week, citing government and industry sources.  Shell, Chevron, ExxonMobil, Total, Eni, and Equinor have each been asked to pay the federal Nigerian government between US$2.5 billion and US$5 billion, according to Reuters’ sources who saw letters sent to the oil majors earlier this year via a government debt-collection division.



Shell, a major investor in Nigeria’s oil industry, will have to take the tax claim seriously, “but we think it has no merits,” Brown told Reuters on the sidelines of the International Petroleum Week conference in London on Tuesday.  The oil major, however, will have to resolve that tax claim issue with Nigeria before considering the final investment decision (FID) on the Bonga South West oil project, the manager said, noting that the FID “may slip into next year.”Earlier this month, Shell’s Nigerian unit, Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company (SNEPCo), announced the Invitation to Tender (ITT) to contractors for the development of the Bonga South West Aparo (BSWA) oil field. The tender is for engineering, procurement, and construction contracts for the 150,000-bpd project in the Gulf of Guinea.Related: Saudi Arabia Aims To Become Large Natural Gas Exporter



“This is a new vista for deep offshore oil and gas exploration in Nigeria based on a revised commercial framework embraced by government and the project investors,” SNEPCo’s Managing Director, Bayo Ojulari, said on February 14.“We now have a clear commercial framework, supported by the government and project investors, toward a potential Bonga South West Aparo Final Investment Decision (FID),” Ojulari said.While a new offshore Nigerian project could be delayed, Shell is looking to fast-track the development of the Whale discovery in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, Brown told Reuters today.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:How Sanctions Are Helping The U.S. Become A Net Oil ExporterPermian Production To Break 4 Million Bpd In MarchA Worrying Trend For International Oil Giants

Japanese refiners are in a rush to buy as much Iranian crude as they can before the sanction waiver window granted by the U.S. Treasury Department closes in May, S&P Global Platts reports, citing unnamed sources.The sources said local refiner Cosmo Oil had ordered a cargo of 900,000 barrels of Iranian heavy crude, to be loaded early next month and this will likely be the last cargo of Iranian crude to be shipped to Japan.



Japan last year suspended all purchases of Iranian crude in anticipation of the sanction waiver it received from the United States in November but has been slow to resume imports of the commodity once the waiver was secured.Japan refinery industry insiders said late last year that they were planning to resume imports of Iranian crude in early 2019, with Trade Minister Hiroshige Seki telling Reuters in November “It would be up to the judgment of private firms, but based on this decision, the (Japanese) companies would likely prepare for resuming Iran crude imports.”



Japan is one of Iran’s largest oil importers, but it is also the United States’ staunchest ally in Asia—and the combination of the two has not worked to Tokyo’s advantage. While the government has been trying to secure a waiver from the U.S. State Department, the Japanese economy seems to be dependent enough on U.S. lending to make local refiners extra-cautious. Now, as Washington reiterates its zero-exports policy towards Tehran, Japanese refiners are apparently trying to make the most of what window they have before the sanctions snap back.""The US policy is to drive Iranian exports to zero,"" a State Department official said at a news conference in Tokyo. ""That policy has not changed. We are unwavering in our policy."" However, Francis Fannon, assistant secretary at the Bureau of Energy Resources added it was too early to say whether the U.S. would consider granting waiver extensions to Iran’s biggest oil clients.

ExxonMobil is expected to soon announce that its drilling campaign offshore the southern coast of the divided island of Cyprus has resulted in a major gas discovery, potentially reigniting tension between Cyprus, Greece, and Turkey in the eastern Mediterranean, The Guardian reports.Turkey, which recognizes the northern Turkish Cypriot government and doesn’t have diplomatic relations with the internationally recognized government of Cyprus, claims that part of the Cyprus offshore area is under the jurisdiction of Turkish Cypriots or Turkey.ExxonMobil planned to begin drilling for oil and gas offshore Cyprus in the fourth quarter last year, while Turkey warned against exploration offshore Cyprus in what it says is ignoring the rights of the Turkish Cypriot people.Exxon has found a commercially viable oil reservoir in Block 10 offshore Cyprus, Kathimerini Cyprus reported earlier this month, citing sources with knowledge of the matter.  Exxon is expected to announce the find this week, according to The Guardian, and this could heat up the race to tap eastern Mediterranean gas resources, but also ratchet up the tension in the area where Cyprus and Turkey have overlapping claims over maritime territories and their natural resources.“All the seismic data suggests that enough has been found to excite ExxonMobil to continue exploration. Potentially there could be great reserves,” Charles Ellinas, an industry expert and former head of Cyprus’s national hydrocarbons company, told The Guardian’s Helena Smith.According to analysts who spoke to The Guardian, a potential major gas find offshore south Cyprus could either act as an incentive for Turkey to negotiate a compromise over the divided island or spark a negative reaction from Ankara, because Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is unpredictable.Turkey will not allow other countries to drill for gas in Turkish or northern Cyprus waters in the eastern Mediterranean, Erdogan warned last November.  Turkish exploration ships will soon start drilling for oil and gas offshore the northern part of Cyprus, the energy minister of the Turkish Cypriots told Turkish Anadolu Agency two weeks ago, a move that could reignite tension between Turkey, Cyprus, and Greece regarding the exploration rights off the eastern Mediterranean island. By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Oil Slides After Trump Calls On OPEC To “Take It Easy”Can Any Country Dethrone Qatar As Top LNG Exporter?One EV Maker Is Offering A Unique Solution To Blackouts

The Securities and Exchange Commission has asked a judge to hold Elon Musk in contempt for violating a deal the regulator struck with the Tesla chief executive last year, which requires him to get the approval of the Tesla board of directors before tweeting anything that could “be material to investors,” Bloomberg reports.The tweet that prompted the SEC move said that Tesla will manufacture half a million cars this year. The tweet, however, was quickly followed by another one, clarifying that “Meant to say annualized production rate at end of 2019 probably around 500k, ie 10k cars/week. Deliveries for year still estimated to be about 400k.”The SEC’s approach to a judge sent Tesla shares down 5.4 percent in after-hours trading and could lead to trouble for Twitter fan Musk.



""Having your CEO in contempt of an SEC action is a pretty bad thing,” Bloomberg quoted the director of a corporate governance center at Delaware University as saying. “They settled with him and within a few months he’s back to doing similar things. It’s unbelievable.""Musk first drew the attention of the Securities and Exchange Commission last summer when the Tesla CEO said on Twitter he was planning to take the company private and had already secured funding.It was this phrase, “funding secured”, that alerted the Securities and Exchange Commission, which launched a probe into this claim, prompting Musk to come forward with the revelation that he had for years been in talks with the Saudi sovereign wealth fund to take the company private.



Yet the tweet and the following explanation caused changes in the Tesla stock price within two days, which allegedly affected shareholders who bought Tesla stock in the period.Now, Musk is facing a range of possible penalties, the harshest of which would be his removal from the chief executive seat and barring him from running another public company for a set period of time.

The U.S. sanctions on Venezuela from late last month cut off more heavy and sour crude oil supply to the global market, leading to the lowest premium of quality light sweet Brent over heavier and sour crude grades because of limited heavy oil supply worldwide.At times when supply of various crude grades is not distorted, Brent usually trades at a premium of $3-$4 a barrel over Dubai, but since January, the premium of Brent over Dubai has been consistently below $1 a barrel, Eesha Muneeb, pricing specialist for the Dubai crude oil benchmark at S&P Global Platts, writes.To top off the sanctions on Iran and the OPEC cuts, the U.S. sanctions on Venezuela at the end of January further tightened the heavy crude market, and traders expect the market to tighten even more in the coming months.



Despite initial expectations that the Venezuelan oil that would have gone to the U.S. could easily make way to Asia, the nature of the U.S. sanctions have effectively turned the U.S. import ban into financial sanctions applicable globally, a Singapore-based crude trader told Platts’ Muneeb.In the middle of February, the April Brent premium to Dubai Exchange Futures for Swaps (EFS)—generally seen as the spot market sentiment of Brent-linked and Dubai-linked crude grades—fell to the lowest on record, since S&P Global Platts started publishing data about the spread in August 2011.Related: Why Oil Tanker Rates Just DoubledThe sanctions on Venezuela and on Iran, as well as OPEC’s cuts, have led to a huge imbalance between light sweet grades and heavy sour grades, especially in Europe, as Middle Eastern and other oil producers are targeting to keep their sales on the Asian market.



Due to tighter supply of medium and heavy sour crude oil, Middle Eastern benchmarks for sour crude grades traded higher than Brent Crude prices at the beginning of February in a rarely seen development in global oil prices.In Europe, some sour crude grades, such as Russia’s Urals, have started to trade at premiums to sweeter crudes because of the limited sour and heavy crude availability, according to S&P Global Platts data.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Wall Street Loses Faith In ShaleGoldman: Brent Oil To Reach $70-$75 SoonU.S. Production Of This Alternative Fuel Is About To Surge

The city of Munich in southern Germany plans have all its electricity produced from 100 percent renewable sources by 2025, but that plan has led to opposition much farther north—in Norway.Munich, Germany’s third most populous city and one of the country’s most important economic hubs, set in 2009 the ambitious goal of achieving 100 percent renewable energy supply by 2025.However, Munich can’t produce on its own solar and wind power enough to generate all-renewables electricity supply for the city of more than 1.3 million residents. The state in which Munich is located, Bavaria, has imposed restrictions on new wind developments, further complicating Munich’s efforts to go all-green electricity by 2025. So the city’s utility has invested in wind projects abroad—in Norway, from where electricity will be exported to Germany.



However, the wind projects in Norway have stirred opposition from environmentalists, hikers, and an indigenous minority in Norway, because the wind farms are set up in sensitive areas, German news outlet Welt Online reports.“Norway has only 12 percent wilderness left, and this area is shrinking,” Clean Energy Wire quoted Per Hanasand, chairman of the Norwegian hiking and trekking association, as telling Welt Online.The wind farm developments in sensitive areas in Norway are even more controversial because all the electricity produced is exported, according to Welt Online.



Most of Norway’s electricity generation comes from hydropower, which had a 93.9-percent share of Norway’s electricity production in December 2018, according to the statistics office. The rest of Norway’s electricity generation came from wind power, 3.9 percent, and from thermal power, 2.2 percent.Last month, Germany became the latest large European economy to lay out a plan to phase out coal-fired power generation, aimed at cutting carbon emissions. A government-appointed special commission at Europe’s largest economy proposed Germany to shut all its 84 coal-fired power plants by 2038. While Germany will mostly seek to replace coal capacity with renewables, the country’s suppliers of natural gas—including Norway—expect to benefit from the coal exit.

Forces loyal to Libya’s eastern strongman General Khalifa Haftar have killed at least 19 people in southern Libya during their campaign to secure oil fields in the area, Mohamed Linu, a member of Libya’s internationally recognized Parliament, told Al Jazeera late on Sunday.The forces killed civilians, including children, and set fire to houses in the town of Murzuq, the Libyan MP told Al Jazeera.Last month, forces loyal to Haftar and his self-styled Libyan National Army (LNA) said that they had started a military operation to secure oil sites and facilities in Libya’s south, where the country’s largest oil field, Sharara, is located.



In early February, a unit of forces loyal to Libya’s UN-backed government in Tripoli was sent south to secure the Sharara oil field.The Sharara oil field has the capacity to pump 340,000 bpd, but has been under force majeure since December 9, 2018, after armed militia and tribesmen seized control and demanded ransom to re-open it.More than two months later, Sharara remains offline, and Libya’s National Oil Corporation (NOC), which refuses to yield to ransom demands, said in December that “Oil production will now only restart at Sharara after alternative security arrangements are put in place.”  



Earlier this month, the forces loyal to Khalifa said that they had taken control over Sharara and that the oil field was secured and ready to restart oil production.The same eastern forces said last week that they had taken control over another oil field in the south, El Feel, which hadn’t stopped pumping oil. Production was not affected and continued at 75,000 bpd, a field engineer told Reuters.On Sunday, NOC’s chairman Mustafa Sanalla, however, rebuffed claims by LNA that Sharara was secure and ready to resume operations.The oil field is not secure yet and remains closed because an armed group is still there, Reuters quoted Sanalla as saying in a video.

Marathon Oil said on Monday that it would be exiting the UK North Sea as it continues to focus on high-return U.S. shale oil operations.Houston-based Marathon Oil has signed an agreement with independent UK company RockRose Energy to sell its UK businesses Marathon Oil U.K. LLC (MOUK) and Marathon Oil West of Shetland Limited (MOWOS), which hold interests in fields in the Greater Brae Area, in Foinaven Field unit, and in Foinaven East. RockRose Energy will assume all obligations associated with MOUK and MOWOS operations in the UK, including decommissioning liability, Marathon Oil said.The price of the sale—subject to customary adjustments—would be around US$140 million, the U.S. company said.



The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2019, with an effective date of January 1, 2019. As of the end of 2018, Marathon Oil carried 21.4 million barrels of oil equivalent of proved reserves in the UK, and 2018 production averaged around 13,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.“Today’s announcement to divest our U.K. business represents our continued commitment to portfolio management and further concentrates our portfolio on high margin, high return U.S. resource plays,” Marathon Oil chairman, president, and CEO Lee Tillman said in a statement.In March last year, Marathon Oil sold its 16.33 percent non-operated interest in the Waha concessions in Libya to France’s Total for US$450 million, exiting Libya.



Earlier this month, Marathon Oil said that it would be spending US$2.4 billion in 2019, with more than 95 percent of that capital budget being allocated to its four key U.S. resource plays—the Eagle Ford, the Bakken, STACK/SCOOP in Oklahoma, and Northern Delaware in the Permian.  Marathon Oil’s U.S. resource play production averaged 295,000 net boed in the fourth quarter of 2018, with oil production averaging 174,000 net bopd, up 22 percent from Q4 2017.

Commodity trading major Vitol expects crude oil prices to rise further as U.S. sanctions on Venezuela and OPEC production cuts squeeze the global supply of heavy crude, Vitol’s chief executive, Russell Hardy, told Bloomberg in an interview.""From here there’s probably the potential to be a little bit higher,"" Hardy said. ""Oil supply is going to be pretty tight until the third quarter.""



Venezuela, Iran, and the rest of OPEC are the factors that will drive this price rise, the first two not so voluntarily, but the latter consciously cutting mostly production of heavier grades rather than lighter ones. At the same time, demand for heavy crude is set to grow further as refiners gear up for the new International Maritime Organization rules on maritime vessel emissions.According to Hardy, the squeeze on heavy crude oil supply, however, will only last for the next six months or so, probably because OPEC will end the cuts once their goal is achieved. However, U.S. production of light crude will continue to grow, Hardy noted, and the second half of the year will see new pipeline capacity additions in the Permian, where all the action seems to be these days, boosting availability of light crude to refineries considerably.



""There could be a question mark over market direction by the fourth quarter of this year,"" Vitol’s CEO said. ""There’s a certain amount of pent-up production that’s awaiting logistics to allow it to be exported. As the pipelines come on, some of the drilled but uncompleted wells will start to hit. We should have a surge in production related to the pipelines.""U.S. crude oil production hit an all-time high of 12 million bpd in the week to February 15 and most of this was light crude.

Exxon is trying to block an investor initiative seeking to force the supermajor to commit to a reduction in harmful emissions, two of these investors told Reuters. The company, the Financial Times reported earlier, had written to the Securities and Exchange Commission calling the investor initiative misleading and saying it was trying to “micro-manage” the business.The investors whose spokespeople talked to Reuters about Exxon’s letter to SEC were the endowment fund of the Church of England and the New York State pension fund.



“Trying to strike out a shareholder proposal from institutional investors with a fiduciary responsibility to manage climate risk is an outdated reflex,” an official for the Church of England fund said in a statement.“Exxon is trying to deny shareholders’ right to vote on a significant climate risk concern,” the New York State Comptroller and manager of the state’s pension fund, Thomas DiNapoli, said. DiNapoli is at the helm of the investor group insisting on Exxon pledging to reduce its carbon footprint.



The Financial Times, which reported on Exxon’s letter earlier on Sunday, quoted another shareholder in the company, the state employee pension fund of California, as saying the issue should be discussed with shareholders rather than Exxon going to thevSEC for help. “The SEC should not be in the role of muffler to important debate,” Calpers said in a statement. The fund is also part of the shareholder group that is pressing Exxon for commitments in the emissions reduction area.Exxon is not the only supermajor that is being targeted by shareholders to do more about climate change. Shell and BP have already made pledges along the lines of more transparent emissions reporting and commitments to reduce these substantially in the coming years. Chances are Exxon will be forced to join the group as the investors pushing for a change manage a combined US$1.9 trillion.

The United Arab Emirates’ main export crude blend, Murban, has recorded a four-month stretch of selling at a discount to the official selling price of Emirati crude in Asia because of intensifying competition from cheap European and U.S. blends, Reuters reports, citing market data as well as sources from the industry.The discount ranged between US$0.05 and US$0.40 a barrel for cargoes bound for loading over the first four months of the year. That’s despite a series of cuts in the benchmark price for Emirati crude, Reuters noted, which also stretched over four months.



Usually, this time of the year is a time of higher demand from Asian refiners as they churn out more fuels used in heating during peak demand season. However, there is more light crude coming from the United States as production booms unrestrained, and arbitrage from Europe has opened, Reuters’ Florence Tan notes.There seems to be an actual oversupply of light crude and this has combined with higher overall prices for Middle Eastern crude because of the cuts agreed in December. The resulting increase in the benchmark Dubai price has made Brent-based blends as well as U.S. ones a lot more attractive to traders and refiners in Asia.



In the immediate term, the UAE’s flagship blend as well as other Middle Eastern blends will likely continue to be pressured as refineries in Asia enter spring maintenance season and demand slumps. Demand for heavy crude, however, is bound to rise further on in the year after maintenance season as refiners prepare for the new lower-emission rules from the International Maritime Organization that come into effect next year.At the same time, U.S. light crude will continue challenging the market share of Middle Eastern light crude in the observable future, as production continues to grow and prices remain attractive.

In its February Short-Term Energy Outlook (STEO) published last week, the EIA estimates that U.S. crude oil production averaged 12.0 million bpd in January, up 90,000 bpd from December. The EIA now sees U.S. crude oil production averaging 12.4 million bpd this year and 13.2 million bpd next year, and most of the growth would come from the Permian.Related: Kicking Mexico’s Addiction To U.S. Natural GasIn the Permian, the EIA estimates in its monthly Drilling Productivity Report published this week that crude oil production is set to rise above 4 million bpd in March for the first time in history. This month, the fastest-growing shale play in the United States is producing an estimated average of 3.981 million bpd, which is set to expand by 43,000 bpd in March, to 4.024 million bpd. This will in turn push the total shale oil output of the United States up by 84,000 bpd to 8.398 million bpd in March from 8.314 million bpd in February.After the EIA figures showed another record in U.S. crude production, oil prices initially turned lower on Thursday amid concerns that soaring American output would be offsetting a large part of the OPEC+ cuts.



Early on Friday, however, prices were supported by hopes that the U.S. and China could reach a deal and avert a trade war. At 07:00 a.m. EST, WTI Crude was up 0.91 percent at $57.48 and Brent Crude traded up 0.54 percent at $67.55.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:The Oil Price Rally Shows No Sign Of StoppingOil To Rise As U.S., China Outline Trade DealThe Oil Producer OPEC Is Overlooking

Militants have attacked Anadarko’s LNG project in Mozambique in what is the first attack on the oil and gas industry in the African country, Bloomberg reports, citing Portuguese news agency Lusa and unnamed sources.More than a dozen masked, armed men attacked a convoy near the project, which is still under construction, and injured four people. The attackers are suspected to be members of an Islamic militant group that has already killed some 100 people in the area near the border with Tanzania in the past 16 month since the insurgency began in northern Mozambique.



The potential implications of the attack are grave as Mozambique is seen to be a hot spot for LNG in the future, with Anadarko’s project alone having a planned annual capacity of 13 million metric tons of liquefied gas. The company has budgeted around US$20 billion for the project.Last week, the Houston Chronicle reported that Anadarko had announced a long-term purchase commitment for 1 million tons annually from its Mozambique project with Indian Bharat Petroleum, strengthening the project’s chances of getting a final investment decision and moving ahead to construction.



To date, Anadarko has secured commitments for about 8.5 million tons of liquefied natural gas annually to be shipped from the Mozambican terminal. Other companies who have signed long-term deals to buy LNG from Anadarko include Shell, Centrica, and Tokyo Gas.However, the militant attack could cast a shadow over the future of the project, not least because it is the first of its kind. Bloomberg cited Mozambique expert Eric Morier-Genoud as saying ""It is the first time an oil and gas company is attacked. The attack also shows a change of modus operandi of the insurgents. They were 15 men to attack a convoy and they were all dressed in black. This has never been seen -- numbers, dress code, and an attack on a main road.""By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:An Underestimated Niche In Oil & GasThe End-Game For Libya’s Oil CrescentThe Ultimate Tool To Prop Up Oil Prices

ExxonMobil has forged a digital partnership with Microsoft to use cloud technology to increase oil production and profitability in its key growth area, the Permian, the U.S. oil supermajor said on Friday.Under the deal with Microsoft, Exxon will use an integrated cloud environment that securely and reliably collects real-time data from oil field assets spanning hundreds of miles. The data will enable ExxonMobil to make faster and better decisions on drilling optimization, well completions, and prioritization of personnel deployment, the oil giant said.According to Exxon, the partnership will make its Permian operations the largest-ever oil and gas acreage to use cloud technology. The application of the cloud technology is expected to generate billions of U.S. dollars in net cash flow for Exxon over the next decade, as data analysis and operational efficiencies improve.   



The partnership has the potential to expand Exxon’s production in the Permian by 50,000 oil-equivalent barrels a day by 2025.“Through our partnership with Microsoft, we’re combining our technical and engineering expertise with cloud and data analytics capabilities to develop the Permian resource in the most capital-efficient manner,” said Staale Gjervik, senior vice president, Permian Integrated Development for Exxon.“Collaboration with Microsoft is key to our future development efforts, which include predictive maintenance capacities, innovative tools for employees, and artificial intelligence and machine learning integration,” Gjervik noted. 



Exxon’s unconventional production in the Permian continued to ramp up in the fourth quarter of 2018, the supermajor said earlier this month, noting that production surged by more than 90 percent from the same quarter of 2017.Exxon’s total global liquids production in Q4 rose by 4 percent from prior-year quarter, driven by growth in the Permian. Oil-equivalent production was 4.010 million bpd in Q4, exceeding 4 million bpd for the first time in nearly two years. A major growth driver of production came from the Permian, where Exxon plans to triple its production by 2025 to more than 600,000 oil-equivalent barrels.   By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:New Sanctions Threat Puts Russian Energy Sector On EdgeThe End-Game For Libya’s Oil CrescentThe World’s Largest Battery To Power The Permian

A deal between Tullow Oil and local Kenyan authorities that would allow the oil company to pump water for the wells and that would be crucial to the final investment decision for Kenya’s first and currently only oil project could be pushed back to the third quarter, Martin Mbogo,Managing Director at Tullow Oil Kenya, told Reuters on Friday.Tullow Oil had hoped that the water deal could be reached by the middle of 2019, but now it is looking more realistic that the agreement will be reached sometime in the third quarter, Mbogo told Reuters.“(It’s) one of those things we absolutely need before we can get to FID,” the manager noted.



Commercial quantities of crude oil in Kenya were discovered in 2012 in the South Lokichar Basin in the north. Tullow Oil, which discovered the resources, has continued its exploration and appraisal drilling campaigns in Kenya.In early June last year, Kenya sent the first trucks transporting crude oil from the oil-rich but landlocked northern region of Turkana to the port of Mombassa, for the country’s first oil exports as part of a pilot export scheme.Last week, Tullow Oil said in its 2018 results release that the “Kenya development plan is progressing well, and the project continues to target a Final Investment Decision (FID) in late 2019 and First Oil in 2022.”Related: Rising Energy Demand Could Be A Boon For The Philippines“In 2019, several critical tasks must be completed to reach a Final Investment Decision by year end. These tasks include completing commercial framework agreements with the Government of Kenya and finalising FEED studies in the first quarter of 2019 and concluding agreements over land title and water supply with the Government of Kenya and submitting both the upstream and the mid-stream ESIAs in the second quarter,” Tullow Oil said last week.



According to its Kenya managing director, there has been progress on the land acquisition issue, but that progress has been slower than expected.Referring to the Early Oil Pilot Scheme (EOPS) that started in June 2018, Tullow said that the trucks are currently transporting around 600 barrels per day (bpd), and the volume is expected to rise to 2,000 bpd once the EOPS is fully operational in April 2019. So far, more than 70,000 barrels of oil have been transported to Mombasa.“A maiden lifting of Kenyan crude oil is expected in mid-2019. Tullow has begun to market Kenya’s low sulphur oil ahead of this first lifting with initial market reactions being very positive,” the company said.  By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Oil To Rise As U.S., China Outline Trade DealAn Underestimated Niche In Oil & GasCracks Begin To Form In Saudi-Russian Alliance

Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund PIF signed a preliminary deal for investments in China’s renewable energy sector during the visit of Crown Prince Mohammed in China, Reuters reports, citing state news agency SPA.“The MOU will enable PIF to support and develop manufacturing, power generation and emerging technologies over the next ten years,” the original report said.The news about the renewables investment commitment comes on the heels of another report from the Crown Prince’s visit in China: the signing of a US$10-billion agreement for the construction of a refinery featuring a petrochemicals complex in oil-hungry China.



This deal, in turn, comes after Aramco signed an early commitment to invest US$100 billion in India’s infrastructure and energy industries.""We want Saudi Aramco to be a household name in India,"" Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said as quoted by S&P Global Platts, adding that India was the number-one priority for the Kingdom’s oil giant.The two visits, to China and India, signal Saudi Arabia’s drive to secure long-term markets for its crude oil but also opportunities to expand its revenue from oil and gas derivatives in line with a strategy to diversify its sources of income and stop being over-reliant on crude oil exports.



However, the Kingdom would have to tread carefully around both India and China which both have close ties with its regional arch-rival Iran. While both China and India have clearly indicated their top priority is security and affordability of crude oil deliveries, geopolitical affiliations are also on the agenda and directly related to this security and affordability of deliveries.The latest Chinese deal, however, also suggests Saudi Arabia is not going to overlook any opportunity to grow in Asia, even outside fossil fuels. The Kingdom has several ambitious projects planned at home as well, but with China being the leader in renewable energy investment, it makes for a natural target for solar and wind investments for the Saudis.

The number of greenfield oil and gas projects to get their final investment decision could rise threefold on 2018, Norwegian energy consultancy Rystad Energy has forecast. Most of these will be offshore projects, the author of the study, upstream analyst Readul Islam said.The number, which only covers conventional oil and gas deposits, could open up production reserves to the tune of 46 billion barrels of oil and gas, including around 14 billion barrels of oil equivalent in deepwater blocks, some 20 billion barrels in shallower waters, and the rest in onshore deposits, Islam said.



The analyst noted “The only supply segment likely to shrink this year is the oil sands, whereas deepwater, offshore shelf and other conventional onshore developments are all poised to show substantial growth. From a geographical perspective, all regions are headed for robust growth except Europe and North America, still bearing in mind that shale plays are not included in these numbers.”The forecast includes a lot of projects whose final investment decision was delayed because of the 2014 oil price crash, indicating that oil and gas companies have now managed to bring their costs down enough to make these large-scale projects commercially viable. About a quarter of the projects expected to receive a FID this year are ones that have been delayed because of the 2014 slump in oil prices.



Yet there is no certainty that all of these projects will receive their final go-ahead this year. A sharp fall in oil prices could once again put the brakes on many greenfield projects. However, others will go ahead, including a number of liquefied natural gas projects in Africa, Russia, and Australia. In oil, Saudi Arabia will account for about one-fifth of the total new reserves to be tapped this year with the expansion of three offshore projects: Marjan, Zuluf, and Berri.

After last October it suffered a 70-percent slump in car sales in China, now Tesla is racing to regain lost market share by releasing its flagship Model 3 on the Chinese market ahead of schedule, Reuters reports, citing a Tesla statement.Initially, the Model 3 release was scheduled for next month but the carmaker is going great guns to regain and expand its share in the world’s largest car market. The first people to take delivery of their Model 3 will be the ones who ordered their vehicles last year, and then Tesla will deliver Model 3s to Chinese customers who ordered their cars this year, the company said.The company began accepting pre-orders for Chinese customers in October 2018.



But regaining market share is not the only reason, at least according to one analyst. “I see its earlier-than-expected delivery as an effort to try and seize the market as quickly as possible,” LMC Automotive analyst Alan Kang told Reuters.Indeed, besides being the largest car market in the world, China is also the largest EV market, with local players vying for market share with foreign brands, including Tesla, which for now is the undisputed leader in the luxury segment but with a host of other high-end EVs coming to the market its position could soon be challenged.Like other carmakers, Tesla became a casualty of the Washington-Beijing trade war, with tariffs swelling the price tags of its cars to unacceptable levels. As a result, last November Tesla announced it would cut the prices for its Model S and Model X cars for Chinese customers by 12 to 26 percent.



“We are absorbing a significant part of the tariff to help make our cars more affordable for customers in China,” the EV maker said in a statement at the time.Coinciding with the early launch of the Model 3 in China, however, Tesla got some bad news from Consumer Reports: the reputable magazine dropped the Model 3 from its top 10 recommended cars citing customer complaints about problems with some car components including loose-fitting exterior parts and defective glass.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:European Oil Demand Is Shockingly WeakCracks Begin To Form In Saudi-Russian AllianceAn Underestimated Niche In Oil & Gas

A car blast killed at least 10 oil workers and fighters from a U.S.-backed Kurdish force battling Islamic State in eastern Syrian on Thursday, Reuters reported, citing residents and witnesses in the area.The bomb attack on a minibus carrying workers employed in one of Syria’s largest oil fields, al-Omar, took place near the town of al-Shuhayl in Syria’s oil-rich eastern province of Deir Ezzor.The area is under the control of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), supported by Washington.



According to AFP, the death toll is at 20 people.Adnan Afrin, a spokesman for the SDF, told AFP that the attack killed mostly oil workers, as well as fighters from the U.S.-backed force battling ISIS in eastern Syria.Jihadist “cells are trying to stop our progress,” Afrin told AFP.



The bomb attack came as the SDF are fighting to expel the ISIS militants from the last territory of their ‘caliphate’ in the village of Baghouz, some 100 kilometers (60 miles) south along the Euphrates River.According to UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a booby-trapped car parked in al-Shuhayl area in the eastern sector of Deir Ezzor province “was remotely detonated when a column of oil workers, technicians, and members of the self-defense Forces passed near it, killing at least 20 people including at least 6 members of the self-defense, and the death toll is expected to rise because there are some people in critical situation.”Earlier this month, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that the U.S. plan to withdraw its troops from Syria would not give Islamic State an opportunity to try to retake some oil fields in the war-torn country.The U.S. Administration is determined to quash the Islamic State caliphate and not to allow it to retake oil fields, whose oil it could sell to fund its operations, Secretary Pompeo told FOX Business in early February.

Devon Energy has said that it will be looking to sell its Canadian assets to become a high-return U.S. oil growth business in what analysts described as a ‘long-overdue’ announcement from the U.S. oil company.Earlier this week, Devon Energy said that its board of directors had authorized the company to pursue the separation of its Canadian and Barnett Shale assets. Devon has retained J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Goldman Sachs to assist it in exploring strategic alternatives for its Canadian business. The firm expects to complete the separation of the Canadian assets by the end of this year, with data rooms expected to be open by the second quarter.



In the fourth quarter of 2018, Devon Energy’s upstream revenue dropped by 18 percent annually, “impacted by historically wide differentials in Canada, which negatively impacted the realized price on heavy oil production,” the company said, noting that it mitigated the weak pricing environment in Canada through its Western Canadian Select basis swap hedge position.As Canadian oil production was growing last year, takeaway capacity constraints and maintenance at U.S. refineries in the fall of 2018 drove down the price of Western Canadian Select (WCS)—the benchmark price of oil from Canada’s oil sands—to as low as US$14 a barrel in October and November, with its discount to WTI at around US$50 a barrel.  



Devon Energy would be the latest non-Canadian oil firm to sell its oil sands assets in Canada. International oil majors have sold a number of oil sands assets in Canada since 2017, with Shell, ConocoPhillips, and Equinor some of the big companies that relinquished expensive oil sands operations after the low oil prices in 2016.  Related: EIA Inventory Report Pushes Oil Prices LowerDevon Energy’s announcement that it wants out of Canada’s oil patch is “long overdue,” St. Louis-based Edward Jones analyst Jennifer Rowland told Financial Post’s Geoffrey Morgan. The U.S. company may even be late to the party of divesting its Canadian business, Rowland noted. Various analysts briefed by Financial Post expect a wide range of a potential price tag for Devon’s Canadian assets—those range from as low as US$2.65 billion (C$3.5 billion) to as high as US$6.8 billion (C$9 billion). Potential suitors would include Canada-based companies, but analysts diverge on who would bid for Devon’s assets, because some Canadian producers are still heavily indebted from the 2017 acquisitions of oil sands from international majors, while for others, Devon’s operations may not be the best strategic fit.   By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:How Sanctions Are Helping The U.S. Become A Net Oil ExporterPermian Production To Break 4 Million Bpd In MarchA Worrying Trend For International Oil Giants

A top U.S. official discussed this week South Korea’s crude oil imports from Iran and urged Seoul to accelerate its oil supply diversification, S&P Global Platts reported on Thursday, quoting a diplomatic source.U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Energy Resources Francis Fannon is on a tour in Asia this week and is visiting Seoul and Tokyo between February 19 and 26. Assistant Secretary Fannon is meeting with government officials and private sector representatives “to discuss energy security and regional cooperation on energy issues,” the U.S. Department of State said, noting that the official will also highlight the importance of energy diversification in the Indo-Pacific Region.Both South Korea and Japan were among the eight Iranian customers who received waivers from the U.S. to continue importing Iranian oil at reduced volumes until early May 2019.



South Korea’s Deputy Minister for Economic Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Yun Kang-hyeon, met with Fannon on Wednesday and discussed ways to increase cooperation in the energy sector, South Korea’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said.Yun and Fannon “talked about the Iranian crude issue and South Korea’s efforts toward diversification of sources of crude imports,” Platts’ source in Seoul said, without elaborating on details.Related: EIA Inventory Report Pushes Oil Prices LowerAccording to Takayuki Nogami, chief economist at Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National, Fannon’s visit seems to be aimed at urging supply diversification and boosting energy security, including by Japan and South Korea increasing their U.S. crude oil imports, which may lead to reduced Iranian oil imports in the region.  



Iran’s key Asian customers—Japan, South Korea, India, and China—are all buying Iranian crude once again, but at much lower rates than they did before November when U.S. sanctions kicked in, S&P Global Platts estimates showed at the end of January.The U.S. has signaled that Iranian customers shouldn’t rely on waiver extensions, but the Trump Administration has not yet officially said if it would stop granting waivers. Some observers say that the decision would depend on the price of oil at the time the U.S. needs to decide on exemptions, because, despite the pledge for ‘zero’ Iranian exports, the Administration will not be willing to drive up oil prices too high.

Nigeria has asked the international oil majors operating in the country to pay a total of almost US$20 billion in outstanding taxes and royalties that it says is owed to various Nigerian states, Reuters reported on Thursday, citing government and industry sources.Chevron, ExxonMobil, Shell, Total, Eni, and Equinor have each been asked to pay the federal Nigerian government between US$2.5 billion and US$5 billion, according to Reuters’ sources who saw letters sent to the oil majors earlier this year via a government debt-collection division.Companies operating in Nigeria pay the government taxes and royalties and provide oil and gas to the state.Norway’s Equinor confirmed to Reuters that there have been letters sent to the companies.



“Several operators have received similar claims in a case between the authorities in Nigeria and local authorities in parts of the country,” a spokesman for the Norwegian firm told Reuters, but noted that “Equinor sees no merit to the case.”Nigeria’s federal government and the local states have recently agreed how to distribute the proceeds from oil and gas, and this distribution involves the central government paying the states several billion U.S. dollars.“This looks like an internal dispute between the federal and local governments. The central government is simply trying to shift to the IOCs (international oil companies) money it owes,” a source at an oil and gas company told Reuters.The multi-billion-dollar tax claims to oil majors add another headwind to investments in Nigeria’s oil industry, which has been plagued by oil theft, oil spills, and militant violence in recent years.



The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) says that Nigeria’s oil production rose by 9 percent annually to 2.09 million bpd in 2018.According to OPEC’s secondary sources, Nigeria’s crude oil production rose by 52,000 bpd from December 2018 to 1.792 million bpd in January 2019, despite Nigeria not being exempt from the OPEC cuts this time around, due to the start-up of Total’s ultra-deepwater oil field Egina.  By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Will The U.S. Actively Pursue Regime Change In Iran?Morgan Stanley: New Oil Discovery Could Spur China’s Shale BoomOil Prices Nearing Breakout Levels

Following the U.S. sanctions, Venezuela’s oil inventories have swelled to a five-year high, The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday, citing satellite data—a sign that Venezuelan oil buyers are fleeing and the country sitting on top of the world’s largest crude resources is struggling to sell its oil.At the end of January, the U.S. imposed sanctions on PDVSA to “help prevent further diverting of Venezuela’s assets by Maduro and preserve these assets for the people of Venezuela. The path to sanctions relief for PdVSA is through the expeditious transfer of control to the Interim President or a subsequent, democratically elected government,” Secretary of the Treasury Steven T. Mnuchin said.



The sanctions block all payments to PDVSA accounts, and buyers of Venezuelan crude are directed to deposit payments in a separate account, to which PDVSA doesn’t have access.A week after the U.S. sanctions were announced, people familiar with the matter told The Journal that Venezuelan oil exports are sharply falling while oil storage tanks in the country are filling up, as Nicolas Maduro’s regime is struggling to find new buyers for Venezuela’s oil.  



The U.S. sanctions not only cut off Venezuela’s exports to the United States—its key outlet market until a few weeks ago—but also ban U.S. exports of naphtha to Venezuela, which the country uses to dilute its thick heavy oil to make it flow. Analysts expect that a shortage of diluents could accelerate from this month the already steadily declining Venezuelan oil production and exports.   Related: The End-Game For Libya’s Oil Crescent Last week, U.S. National Security Advisor John Bolton warned countries and companies against buying crude oil from Venezuela, after the Latin American country’s Oil Minister Manuel Quevedo said during a surprise visit to India that Venezuela wants to sell more oil to the fast-growing Indian market.According to energy research and consulting firm Rystad Energy, in the low case scenario, where the status-quo continues and Venezuela is unable to offset the effects of U.S. sanctions and secure new financing, the country could see its crude oil production decline by an additional 20-percent in 2019, dropping to about 800,000 bpd, before sliding to 680,000 bpd in 2020.

Nigeria could start reducing its crude oil production in line with the OPEC-wide output cut agreed last December, President Muhammadu Buhari said as quoted by Nigeria media, speaking to a special envoy of the Saudi king Salman.The country was not this time exempted from the cuts: OPEC assigned it a production cut quota of 2.5 percent of the 1.7 million bpd the West African country was producing when the cut agreement was struck. This amounts to about 40,000 bpd, Energy Minister Emmanuel Ibe Kachikwu said at the time.



However, instead of reducing its production, Nigeria boosted it with the start of production at the giant Egina offshore field, operated by French Total. The French supermajor began production at Egina on December 29. Total noted that the plateau production at the ultra-deepwater field would be 200,000 barrels of oil per day, which would account for some 10 percent of Nigeria’s oil production at that future point.Following a wave of militant violence in 2016 and early 2017 that crippled the country’s oil industry, Nigeria’s oil production started to recover in the latter half of 2017, when attacks on oil infrastructure subsided. According to the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), the country’s oil production increased by 9 percent in 2018 compared to 2017.



Now, however, Saudi Arabia is showing determination to get everyone in line to boost prices, and is sending a special envoy to Nigeria, one of OPEC’s larger producers. Indeed, Buhari was quoted as saying he wished there was no need for Nigeria to reduce its production of crude oil and he’d rather the country could produce more.He went on to add that “I have listened carefully to the message. I will speak with the Minister of State for Petroleum. I will call for the latest production figures. I know that it is in our interest to listen. We will cooperate.” The statement issued after the meeting also said higher oil prices would be beneficial for both Saudi Arabia and Nigeria: an argument that has been put to the test repeatedly and has not invariably passed this test.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:EIA Inventory Report Pushes Oil Prices LowerPermian Production To Break 4 Million Bpd In MarchA Worrying Trend For International Oil Giants

Glencore has become the latest energy heavyweight to succumb to climate change pressure and has announced it will stop raising its coal production capacity, CNBC reports.The Swiss company’s current thermal coal production capacity is 150 million tons annually, which makes it the biggest single exporter of the commodity. But as pressure mounts on the energy and manufacturing industries to put more effort into tackling climate change by reducing harmful emissions, companies are beginning to transform.Glencore, for example, plans to use the capital that will be freed thanks to the capacity cap to increase its production of basic metals such as copper, cobalt, nickel, vanadium, and zinc, all of them used in EV batteries and other technology that enables the shift to cleaner energy generation.



The move is also aimed at avoiding shareholder concerns as this group of stakeholders, too, become increasingly environmentally conscious.“To deliver a strong investment case to our shareholders, we must invest in assets that will be resilient to regulatory, physical and operational risks related to climate change,"" Glencore said in a statement. ""As one of the world's largest diversified resource companies, Glencore has a key role to play in enabling transition to a low carbon economy,"" it also said.The decision could not have been an easy one to make: last year, profits from coal amount to US$5.2 billion, versus US$4.7 billion from copper, Bloomberg reported, citing Glencore’s latest financial figures. This was the first time coal profits exceeded copper profits as demand for the fossil fuel used widely for power generation in emerging markets continued to be strong.



However, there is a bright silver lining. “Limiting ourselves with no further growth will tighten up supplies. It should bode well for prices,” chief executive Ivan Glasenberg said. “It’s one of the commodities in the world where there is no big increase in new supply.”By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Cheaper Natural Gas Is Coming To EuropeWhere Will Putin Build His Next Gas Pipeline?Why The Oil Rally Isn’t Over Yet

A technical committee monitoring the implementation of the OPEC/non-OPEC production cuts has found that the allies achieved an 83-percent compliance with the pledged reduction, four delegates told Reuters on Wednesday.OPEC and a group of non-OPEC producers led by Russia decided in December to cut production by a total of 1.2 million bpd between January and June in a renewed effort to rebalance the market and drive oil prices up.OPEC’s Monthly Oil Market Report (MOMR) showed last week that the cartel’s crude oil production dropped by 797,000 bpd from December 2018 to average 30.81 million bpd in January 2019. Saudi Arabia cut production by 350,000 bpd to 10.213 million bpd, below its 10.311 million bpd ceiling in the production cut pact. Saudi Arabia’s Arab Gulf allies Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) also cut output substantially. Iraq reduced production by 43,000 bpd from December to 4.669 million bpd in January. This is still way above Iraq’s quota of 4.512 million bpd.



OPEC’s lower production in January was also helped by more than 50,000 bpd declines in each of Libya and Venezuela, which, however, are exempted from the cuts together with Iran.Among non-OPEC nations, Russia is taking the lion’s share of the non-OPEC cuts and pledged to reduce production by 230,000 bpd from October’s 11.421 million bpd level, to 11.191 million bpd.Moscow, however, has repeatedly said that due to weather and geological conditions in the cold Russian winter, it cannot cut its oil production too quickly.Related: Cheaper Natural Gas Is Coming To Europe



In mid-January, Khalid al-Falih, the energy minister of Saudi Arabia—the OPEC kingpin and key Russian ally in all OPEC/non-OPEC production policy deals since early 2017—had said that Russia was moving with the cuts “slower than I’d like.”Referring to Russia’s share of the cuts, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said last week that as of February 14, the country had reduced its production by 80,000 bpd-90,000 bpd from October’s levels.Novak said last week that the Russian companies would be trying to accelerate the cuts to reach the target by April.  By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:How Sanctions Are Helping The U.S. Become A Net Oil ExporterThe World’s Largest Battery To Power The PermianWill The U.S. Actively Pursue Regime Change In Iran?

The American Petroleum Institute (API) reported a build in crude oil inventory of 1.26 million barrels for the week ending February 15, coming in under analyst expectations that predicted a build in crude oil inventories to the tune of 3.080 million barrels.Last week, the API reported a small but unexpected crude draw of 998,000 barrels. A day later, the EIA reported a larger one of 3.6 million barrels. Oil prices were trading up earlier on Tuesday, with WTI trading up $0.80 (+1.42%) at $57.25, while the Brent crude benchmark was trading up $0.68 (+1.02%) at $67.13. Both benchmarks were up on significantly on the week as oil bulls dare to bet on a trade resolution between China and the United States, and as OPEC data shows that Saudi Arabia is willing and able to cut production as promised—and then some. Venezuela’s falling oil production is yet another bullish factor. 



The API this week reported a draw in gasoline inventories for week ending February 15 in the amount of 1.55 million barrels. Analysts estimated a smaller draw in gasoline inventories of 350,000 barrels for the week.US crude oil production as estimated by the Energy Information Administration showed that production for the week ending February 8—the latest information available—averaged 11.9 million barrels per day for the fifth week in a row.Distillate inventories decreased this week by 758,000 barrels, compared to an expected draw of 1.691 million barrels.

Kinder Morgan plans to increase the loading and unloading capacity of its ethanol hub in Argo, Illinois—which serves as a benchmark for global ethanol prices—in a bid to address concerns that ethanol trade at the hub could be vulnerable to manipulation, Reuters reported on Wednesday, citing three people with knowledge of the company plans.At an industry conference in Florida last week, Kinder Morgan told ethanol traders that it was looking to at least double the amount of barges capable of loading and unloading ethanol at the two docks at Argo and allowing a third dock, for petrochemicals, to also load and unload ethanol, according to the three people briefed by Reuters.The faster movement of ethanol volumes through Argo would diminish concerns that inventories at the hub could be driven up faster than being drawn down, thus driving down the price of ethanol.



“If you can send barrels in faster than you can take out, then you can drive down the price faster and for a longer period. This will help equalize that and level the playing field,” an ethanol trader told Reuters.U.S. ethanol prices hit in November 2018 their lowest level in 13 years, due to oversupply. In addition, Archer Daniels Midland, a major commodities merchant, which was typically a big buyer of ethanol until late 2017, switched to a big seller last year, contributing to the excessive supply. Pressured by low ethanol prices and unclear U.S. policies on biofuels, several ethanol plants have idled production or shut in recent months.



Scott Irwin from the Department of Agricultural and Consumer Economics, University of Illinois, wrote in Ohio’s Country Journal on Wednesday that the U.S. ethanol industry saw in 2018 its first losing year since 2012, due to overproduction.“The fortunes of the U.S. ethanol industry are unlikely to improve until production and use are better balanced. This will require shuttering some production capacity, additional demand, or some combination of the two. The most optimistic scenario is additional demand for U.S. ethanol exports as part of a trade deal with China,” Irwin says.

Saudi Arabia expects that it can reach a deal with Kuwait to resume oil production from joint oil fields in the so-called Neutral Zone this year, Saudi Arabia’s Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said on Wednesday.“We hope in 2019 it will be resolved,” Reuters quoted al-Falih as saying a day after meeting with the Emir of Kuwait, Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah.The so-called Partitioned Neutral Zone (PNZ) was established between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait in 1922 to settle a territorial dispute between the two countries. As of 2015, the oil production capacity in the neutral zone stood at 600,000 bpd, equally divided between Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, according to the EIA. Production from the zone averaged around 500,000 bpd just before the shutdown of the two oil fields, Khafji and Wafra, in 2014-2015.



As of October 2018, operational divergences and geopolitical divisions were still preventing Saudi Arabia and Kuwait from making any progress in talks about the potential restart of the jointly operated oil fields that analysts were hoping could soon add 500,000 bpd of oil production in the Middle East.A few weeks before that, at the end of September 2018, Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman discussed the restart of crude oil production in the neutral zone during a meeting with Kuwait’s Emir. The Saudi Crown Prince’s visit to Kuwait, however, was cut short, while big divergences between the two sides remained.In December 2018, The Wall Street Journal reported that Saudi Arabia and Kuwait were inching closer to restarting oil production in the Neutral



Zone after the United States had intervened to broker a deal between the two countries. Production could restart in the first quarter this year, the Journal reported two months ago, citing oil officials familiar with the negotiations. The resumption of production from those fields and the potential adding of 500,000 bpd production capacity in the Middle East could alleviate concerns about tightening supply as the U.S. mulls over phasing out the waivers it had granted to key Iranian oil buyers, according to The Journal.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:OPEC’s Next Big Crisis2 Reasons Why Big Oil Isn’t Rushing Into RenewablesEmerging ‘Quality’ Problem To Haunt Oil Markets

Venezuela’s Oil Minister Manuel Quevedo, a former general appointed by Nicolas Maduro in late 2017 to lead Venezuela’s oil industry and state oil firm PDVSA, has said that a terrorist attack was carried out on a PDVSA pumping station in the state of Monagas, the teleSUR news outlet reported on Wednesday.Quevedo denounced the attack, which he said was aimed at cutting off Venezuela’s oil exports, according to teleSUR. No people were killed or injured in the sabotage, the minister said.“Yesterday we listened to the war allocation by the U.S. President, and call to violence, and now we start to see that violence and terrorist attacks,” teleSUR quoted Quevedo as saying. According to the minister, the right-wing parties in Venezuela were behind the attack, as they don’t have a political project and that’s why they “recurred to violence, led by the U.S. government who has lost their masks and pretend to lead us to a war among equals,” as carried by teleSUR.



On Monday, U.S. President Donald Trump urged members of the Venezuelan military to abandon support for Maduro or “lose everything.”President Trump also tweeted: “I ask every member of the Maduro regime: End this nightmare of poverty, hunger and death. LET YOUR PEOPLE GO. Set your country free! Now is the time for all Venezuelan Patriots to act together, as one united people. Nothing could be better for the future of Venezuela!” The United States and many European countries have recognized opposition leader Juan Guaidó as the interim president of Venezuela amid the political crisis in the country sitting on top of the world’s largest crude oil reserves.



The U.S. sanctions on Venezuela from late January are expected to speed up the decline of Venezuelan exports, which have been falling over the past three years as oil production has been plunging due to lack of investment, mismanagement, and a rampant economic crisis.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Where Will Putin Build His Next Gas Pipeline?MIT Professors: This Is The Energy System Of The FutureWhy The Oil Rally Isn’t Over Yet

India is an investment priority for Saudi Aramco, the chief executive of the Saudi oil giant Amin Nasser said on Wednesday in New Delhi, noting that Aramco is in talks with India’s biggest refining and petrochemicals company Reliance Industries for potential investments and is looking at other opportunities as well.Saudi Arabia, OPEC’s largest producer and the world’s top crude oil exporter, is looking to secure off-take deals for its crude in the strategic fast-growing Indian oil market in Asia, and is also heavily investing in the refining and petrochemicals at home and abroad.



“India is an investment priority for Saudi Aramco. India takes from us almost 800,000 barrels a day and by 2040 India’s total consumption will be around 8.2 million barrels per day,” Reuters quoted Aramco’s CEO Nasser as saying at a panel in New Delhi during the one-day visit of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to India.India’s current demand is around 4.7 million bpd and the country is the world’s third-largest oil consumer.



In June last year, Saudi Aramco and the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) signed a framework agreement and a memorandum of understanding with a consortium of Indian national oil companies to join a project for a mega refinery and petrochemical complex in India worth US$44 billion. However, the huge project has faced setbacks because farmers have been unwilling to give up their land for the site of the plant, and earlier this week the Maharashtra state announced that the project would be relocated to another site.Saudi Aramco is willing to invest in other projects in India, Nasser said on Wednesday, noting that the oil giant is in talks with Indian companies, including Reliance Industries.“We are looking at it. We are not limited to that investment which is the mega refinery,” Nasser said, referring to the US$44-billion project.

Commonwealth LNG has struck purchase commitments with European clients for almost half the annual capacity of its liquefaction plant in Louisiana, Reuters reports, quoting chief executive Paul Varello. The total capacity of the facility is 8.4 million tons of LNG per year.“We are exchanging documents with counterparties that will represent three to four million tonnes” Varello said in an interview. The executive added, “We have to work hard to get closer to the full 8 million tonnes in heads of agreements to allow us to feel good about getting 6 million tonnes in final agreements.”



The company is promising prices of less than US$2.50 per million British thermal units under long-term contracts of 20 years. Europe is a natural focal point for future LNG supplies from the new liquefaction terminals currently under construction in the United States, but purchase commitments need to be secured in advance so the companies building the facilities get the loans they need to build the projects.The Louisiana facility has yet to get the final investment decision of Commonwealth, which should happen by the third quarter or the end of 2020, after which construction will begin. Launch of the project is scheduled for 2024.



Long-term contracts have become difficult to secure in LNG because of the abundance of fuel on spot markets and the price sensitivity as more and more liquefaction terminals come on stream in places like Australia and Russia, as well as in Africa. Yet LNG producers need long-term commitments from buyers to get the funds they need to build the facilities.In the United States, some 10 new LNG plants are being planned or are already under construction as the shale boom has boosted the availability of cheap natural gas to be liquefied and sent to international markets, with a focus on Europe and Asia.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Bank Of America: Oil ‘Anchored’ Until 2024Amazon To Invest In Electric Pickups, SUVsDoes Saudi Arabia Really Have As Much Oil As Analysts Think?

Alberta has increased its bet on oil-by-rail transportation in the absence of new pipeline projects moving ahead, and will now lease 4,400 new rail cars to move more of its heavy crude south. The new rail transport capacity will add 120,000 bpd to the daily rate of shipments from Canada’s oil province.“This is something that is fundamentally important to improving the return that all Albertans get on our important energy resources,” Alberta Premier Rachel Notley told media, as quoted by the Calgary Herald.



The lease will cost US$2.8 billion (C$3.7 billion) over three years but it is expected to result in a US$4.47-billion (C$5.9-billion) increase in oil royalties for the province as well as taxes, and commercial revenues over the same period.There seems to be a unanimous agreement that increasing oil shipments by rail is not the ultimate solution, rather just a temporary one. However, the ultimate solution, at least according to oil industry proponents, is building pipelines, which doesn’t seem to be happening at the moment because of the strong opposition.



Among the other options Premier Notley’s government has considered was the construction of a new refinery in Alberta so more of the heavy crude produced in the province could be refined locally instead of exported, but this, too, has doubtful benefits.Alberta has four refineries at present, with a combined refining capacity of 475,000 bpd. There are also two other specialized diesel-producing facilities that can refine 110,000 bpd of crude. A new refinery would indeed serve to stabilize prices of Canadian crude, but there is one problem: a refinery cannot be built in a month, or even in a year. What’s more, some experts argue that Canada’s oil province already has too much refining capacity and the only solution to its price problem are more pipelines.

TransCanada has restarted a section of its Keystone oil pipeline that was shut down after a leak of about 43 barrels of crude occurred in Missouri earlier this month, Reuters reports, citing TransCanada spokesman Terry Cunha.The Keystone pipeline transports some 600,000 bpd of crude oil from Alberta to Illinois and the shutdown reduced the flow to 590,000 bpd.



The leak will likely serve to reinforce opposition to new pipeline projects on both sides of the border, especially since a couple of years ago a Reuters report revealed that the Keystone pipeline had leaked more often and higher amounts than TransCanada had calculated in its risk assessment submitted to U.S. regulators before the pipeline began operation nine years ago.In the seven years between 2010 and 2017, when the report came out, the Keystone network from Alberta to Texas had experienced three major leaks, of which the biggest was of 5,000 barrels that occurred in South Dakota late November 2017, and two of about 400 barrels each in North Dakota in 2011 and South Dakota in 2016.



The controversial Keystone XL pipeline was planned to expand the original Keystone network but it seems its future has been called into question again: earlier this month, District Judge Brian Morris banned the company from conducting some preliminary construction work on the project although it allowed it some other activities such as preparing storage and container yards and taking deliveries of pipelines. It cannot, however, prepare sights for construction camps as the lawsuit launched by Native American tribes and environmentalists against the company continues.The 830,000 bpd pipeline will run from the Albertan oil sands through Montana and South Dakota, ending in Nebraska, where it would connect to the existing pipeline network that goes on to the Gulf Coast as long as the court approves the new environmental impact assessment it ordered the State Department to make.

Iranian crude oil exports in January were higher than expected, while February shipments so far have been holding steady or even higher compared to last month, as several of Iran’s customers are using up their U.S. sanction waivers to continue importing Iranian oil, Reuters reported on Tuesday, citing industry sources and shipping data.According to tanker-tracking data from Refinitiv Eikon and a source at a company tracking Iranian oil flows, Iran’s exports in February have averaged 1.25 million bpd so far, while the January exports were between 1.1 million bpd and 1.3 million bpd, higher than the previously expected below 1-million-bpd level, which was seen in December.While tracking Iran’s oil exports has become an increasingly difficult task after the U.S. sanctions returned in early November, some of the key Iranian oil customers that received U.S. waivers resumed buying Iran’s oil in 2019 or increased imports to their respective ceiling allowed under the waivers, after an initial ‘wait-and-see mode’ for November and December purchases amid uncertainties who is getting waivers.



Iran’s key Asian customers—Japan, South Korea, India, and China—are all buying Iranian crude once again, but at much lower rates than they did before November when U.S. sanctions kicked in, S&P Global Platts estimates showed at the end of January.According to the S&P Global Platts calculations, the rate at which India, Japan, and South Korea are importing Iranian crude at the moment, is at least half lower than the rate from before the sanctions went into effect.Related: The Biggest Problem Behind The U.S. Shale BoomIndia and China are Iran’s largest crude oil buyers, accounting for 80 percent of the country’s oil exports to Asia, which, in total, constituted half of Iran’s overall oil exports. Now, as the sanction waiver window narrows, S&P Global Platts analysts expect Iran’s oil exports to fall to 1.2 million bpd over the first four months of 2019, and further slump to 860,000 bpd in the fourth quarter of the year. This compares with an average 2.7 million bpd in the first few months of 2018, before President Trump pulled the United States out of the so-called Iran nuclear deal last May.



As the ‘waivers window’ will be shrinking ahead of the end of the 180-day waiver period in early May, buyers could be rushing to buy what they can before April in order to be able to complete transactions before May in case waivers are not extended, according to analysts.The U.S. has signaled that Iranian customers shouldn’t rely on waivers extensions, but the Trump Administration has not yet officially said if it would stop granting waivers. Some observers say that the decision would depend on the price of oil at the time the U.S. needs to decide about exemptions, because, despite the pledge for ‘zero’ Iranian exports, the Administration will not be willing to drive up oil prices too high.

The fate of a proposed mega refinery and petrochemical complex in India worth US$44 billion and involving the national oil companies of Saudi Arabia and the UAE could depend on the outcome of India’s general elections this spring and whether the party of incumbent Prime Minister Narendra Modi could win a second term in office.In June last year, Saudi Aramco and the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) signed a framework agreement and a memorandum of understanding with a consortium of Indian national oil companies to join the mega project at Ratnagiri in the Maharashtra state on India’s west coast. Saudi Aramco and ADNOC will jointly own 50 percent of the new joint venture company RRPCL, while the other 50 percent will be held by the Indian consortium. The parties agreed to explore a strategic partnership and co-investment in the development of the US$44 billion mega refinery.  By investing in the giant Indian refinery, the national oil companies of leading OPEC producers Saudi Arabia and the UAE would secure off-take for their crude in a strategic fast-growing oil market in Asia. 



However, the process of land acquisition for the new giant complex was put on hold late last year due to strong opposition from local farmers, many of whom depend on their land for their income and livelihoods.On Monday, the chief minister of Maharashtra state, Devendra Fadnavis, announced that the planned refinery would be relocated to another site, without specifying it.Related: U.S.-China Trade Deal Could Boost Gasoline PricesFadnavis, a member of Prime Minister Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), made the announcement after sealing an alliance for the general election with regional party Shiv Sena, which has opposed the proposed refinery.



The completion of the refinery carries a lot of political risk, and it would also depend on who wins the next election or who makes it in a coalition government, Sri Paravaikkarasu, an analyst at industry consultant FGE in Singapore, told Bloomberg.According to Ratnagiri Refinery & Petrochemicals Ltd (RPPL), the joint venture company responsible for the huge 1.2 million bpd complex construction and development, the refinery is expected to be commissioned by the year 2025.According to FGE, the first phase could be ready in 2027-2028, and even this could be an optimistic timeline, considering the recent developments, Paravaikkarasu told Bloomberg.    By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Where Will Putin Build His Next Gas Pipeline?Why The Oil Rally Isn’t Over YetDoes Saudi Arabia Really Have As Much Oil As Analysts Think?

TransCanada has applied with the National Energy Board of Canada for permission to start transporting natural gas from the west of the country to New Brunswick in the east, using existing pipeline infrastructure, CBC reports, adding the company has won the support of Enbridge and Irving Oil, the two largest gas retailers in New Brunswick.According to the general manager of Enbridge, Gilles Volpe, the move could cut consumers’ gas bills by as much as 30-40 percent. The plan, Volpes said, “ gives access to more capacity, and more access to the Alberta-based natural gas. That natural gas is plentiful, of course, but it's also very stable from a price point of view.""



Enbridge has already signed a contract for the deliveries of natural gas from Alberta to the East for 20.5 years beginning in 2021. Irving Oil has also signed a contract, with deliveries beginning this November.""EGNB [Enbridge Gas New Brunswick] does not have access to local supply, nor local natural gas storage facilities to meet its franchise needs at this time and considers [gas from the west] as a valuable asset in meeting the needs of Atlantic Canada long term,"" said Volpe.



Previously, New Brunswick got its gas from offshore fields in Nova Scotia, but production there was shut down last year, leaving Alberta as the natural replacement for supplies of the fuel.TransCanada’s idea to use existing pipelines to ship gas from the West to the East comes after the company dropped its plans for the Energy East pipeline that would have shipped Alberta crude oil to the east.The company cited regulatory tightening as reason for its decision to give up Energy East. Environmentalist opposition to any new pipeline projects also helped tip the scales against Energy East. But the decision has opened up spare capacity that could be used to transport gas and keep its price low enough to make it competitive.

Citgo, the U.S. unit of Venezuela’s PDVSA, has removed from their positions four top executives as the battle for control over the company between the Maduro government and the opposition, led by Juan Guaido, heats up.Reuters quotes unnamed sources as saying the executives who were removed were close to the Venezuelan President. The move is part of the opposition’s attempt to seize control over the profitable business. Earlier this month, Guaido said he and his interim government were preparing a whole new board of directors for Citgo as well as for PDVSA.All of the executives who were removed from their positions are Venezuelans, one of them a cousin of late Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez.



Meanwhile, the families of the so-called Citgo Six—company executives jailed in Venezuela two years ago on allegations of corruption—have spoken up, saying their relatives were held in overcrowded conditions.The executives, including then-president Jose Angel Pereira, were accused of embezzlement after they proposed to refinance about US$4 billion in Citgo-issued debt by using a 50-percent stake in the company as collateral.According to one Citgo employee, as quoted by the Daily Mail, the families of the jailed executives received no support from the company despite terms in their contracts stipulating they had the right to such support.



Citgo is the eight-largest refining company in the United States, accounting for about 4 percent of the national refining capacity. It is also, understandably, the largest buyer of Venezuelan crude oil in the United States.The company was swept into the political chaos reigning in Venezuela after Juan Guaido, President of the opposition-dominated National Assembly, declared himself interim president saying the latest elections that saw Maduro win a second term in office rigged and calling for a new vote. Guaido has received the support of the U.S., Canada, most South American countries, and the EU.

Norway’s Equinor plans to start exploratory drilling offshore Australia next year, the company said in the draft environmental plan it released today for public comment as part of efforts to assuage worries that oil exploration in the Great Australian Bight could cause an environmental disaster.The draft is also a mandatory part of the regulatory approval process for the project, which the Norwegian company took over from BP two years ago when the UK-based supermajor decided it had enough regulatory and public opposition problems in Australia and pulled out of the Great Australian Bight.



“We have made the draft EP available to members of the community and we will take all comments into consideration before updating our EP and submitting it to the independent regulator. This draft EP is the result of more than two years of careful preparation and our 1500-page plan demonstrates how we can drill safely and includes a robust emergency response plan,” Equinor’s country manager for Australia, Jone Strangeland, said.Opposition, however, remains strong. Last year, environmentalist media reported that Greenpeace had obtained a draft Oil Pollution Emergency Plan from the Norwegian company that confirmed some of their worst fears: in the worst possible scenario, a spill from a gushing well could spread along all of Australia’s southern coast and even reach Sydney, threatening a sensitive ecosystem including endangered species.



Reuters notes there has been no oil and gas exploration in the Great Australian Bight since 2003 and all the wells drilled in the region previously had come up dry. However, Wood Mackenzie estimates suggest that the area could hold 1.9 billion barrels of crude oil and natural gas. Equinor, used to operating in harsh climatic environments, could be better suited than BP and Chevron to try its hand at the Great Australian Bight, but the go-ahead is far from certain given the strong opposition.

Tesla has removed all information it had about its Model 3 standard version on its website and some fans of the brand are panicking, Electrek’s Fred Lambert reports.It was this base Model 3 with a standard battery pack that was supposed to be Tesla’s “secret weapon” on the car market, the affordable luxury electric vehicle that would solidify and boost Tesla’s dominance in its niche market and spread it over into the mainstream car market. However, this might have to wait.Lambert quotes CEO Elon Musk comments about the base Model 3 made during the company’s Q4 financial results conference call that suggest the base model could be made available to buyers later this year but, as per Musk “it’s a rough, rough guess.”



The problem is the cost, as is so often the case. The affordable Tesla has been promoted with a price tag of just US$35,000, but right now the cheapest version of the Model 3 costs US$42,000 and that’s after a price reduction. Tesla has more work to do on the car to lower the cost to US$35,000 and it said on its website that this would take “4 to 6 months.” Now, this information has been removed from the website, causing some fans of the brand who had pre-ordered a Model 3 to worry.This is hardly the first time Tesla’s CEO had had fans worried and will hardly be the last. Elon Musk is notorious for setting tight deadlines for this or that milestone in Tesla and then going into delays when the deadlines prove unrealistic. This could the case here as well: bringing the starting price of a base Model 3 down to US$35,000 is certainly a challenge. However, there is a possibility Tesla will not overcome it.Related: How Trump And Kim Jong Un Could Boost Vietnam's Energy Sector



In his report on the removal of base Model 3 info from the website, Electrek’s Lambert quoted a tweet from Musk from early February that said the base Model 3 will cost US$35,000 after incentives. But the company had initially said it would cost US$35,000 before incentives, again sparking worry.The crux of the matter is the battery pack. Tesla needs to bring the cost of the Model 3 standard battery pack down further if it is to accomplish its US$35,000 goal. This is apparently proving harder to do than originally expected.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:‘’Lower Your Costs, Or Die’’ Big Oil’s New MantraSaudi Arabia Boosts Pakistan Energy Relations With $20 Billion PledgeOil Prices Near Three-Month High As Market Tightens

Saudi Arabia’s crude oil exports plunged by nearly 550,000 bpd to 7.687 million bpd in December 2019, down from a two-year high in November, as the Kingdom started to limit supply after the U.S. granted waivers to eight Iranian customers and the market swung into oversupply. According to data by the Joint Organisations Data Initiative (JODI) database, which collects self-reported figures from 114 countries, the Saudi oil production also dropped in December—to 10.6 million bpd from an all-time high of 11.09 million bpd in November.  In November, Saudi Arabia’s crude oil exports had jumped by 534,000 bpd month on month to 8.24 million bpd—the highest level in two years as the Kingdom moved to offset supply losses from Iran with the return of the U.S. sanctions on Tehran’s oil industry.



The month before that, Saudi Arabia had increased its October crude oil exports to what was then the highest level since January 2017, when the initial OPEC/non-OPEC production cut deal began.But after the U.S. granted waivers to eight key Iranian oil customers to continue importing oil from Iran until early May this year, Saudi Arabia and its allies at OPEC and non-OPEC Russia pared back production as the market started to fear a growing oversupply amid uncertain demand growth.Related: U.S.-China Trade Deal Could Boost Gasoline PricesAs a result, OPEC and its Russia-led non-OPEC partners agreed to a new production cut deal in early December, targeting to remove 1.2 million bpd from the market between January and June this year, with Iran, Venezuela, and Libya exempted from cuts due to their ‘special circumstances.’



Saudi Arabia has reduced production more than its share of the cuts and has recently signaled that it would cut crude oil production and exports even deeper next month.In an interview with the Financial Times published last week, Saudi Arabia’s Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said that the Saudis would cut production to around 9.8 million bpd in March, some 500,000 bpd below the commitment in the OPEC+ deal. Saudi Arabia would be cutting its crude oil exports to near 6.9 million bpd next month, slashed from 8.2 million bpd just three months ago.

OPEC’s production cuts and the U.S. sanctions on Venezuela and Iran have been limiting the availability of heavy and sour crude grades to Europe, where prices for heavier grades have recently shot up amid an increasingly tightening market, crude traders tell S&P Global Platts.The U.S. sanctions on Iran had already limited some of the heavy grade supply into Europe. Then with the new round of OPEC/non-OPEC cuts that began in January, Iraq’s Basra Light and Heavy—typically very popular among European refiners—have also been in short supply on the spot market in Europe as Iraq is diverting more barrels of Basra to the premium market for Middle Eastern producers: Asia.  “There are no destination-free Basrah cargoes at the moment coming to Europe for the end of February as they’re targeting Asia,” a crude trader told Platts.



To top off the sanctions on Iran and the OPEC cuts, the U.S. sanctions on Venezuela at the end of January further tightened the heavy crude market in Europe, and traders expect the market to tighten even more in the coming months.The sanctions on Venezuela and on Iran, as well as OPEC’s cuts, have led to a huge imbalance between light sweet grades and heavy sour grades, especially in Europe, as Middle Eastern and other oil producers are targeting to keep their sales on the Asian market.Due to tighter supply of medium and heavy sour crude oil, Middle Eastern benchmarks for sour crude grades traded higher than Brent Crude prices at the beginning of February in a rarely seen development in global oil prices.



In Europe, some sour crude grades, such as Russia’s Urals, have started to trade at premiums to sweeter crudes because of the limited sour and heavy crude availability, according to S&P Global Platts data.“Urals is at positive numbers, Basrah is trading at dramatic premium to OSP and I don’t see why sour should soften, demand is there but there is not much available,” a trader told Platts.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Bank Of America: Oil ‘Anchored’ Until 2024U.S.-China Trade Deal Could Boost Gasoline PricesHow Trump And Kim Jong Un Could Boost Vietnam's Energy Sector

Engineers from Scotland and Italy have developed a new wave energy technology that could generate low-cost electricity for thousands of homes.Engineers from the University of Edinburgh and from several universities in Italy have designed, developed, and tested a device that costs less than conventional designs and that can be incorporated into existing ocean systems, the University of Edinburgh has said in a statement, describing the scientists’ study published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society A scientific magazine.The ocean and sea waves can provide a source of renewable energy, but few wave energy converters have moved past pre-commercial stage because of the high costs and the often harsh marine environment, the authors of the paper argue.



So they designed the so-called Dielectric Elastomer Generator (DEG) using flexible rubber membranes. The device is cheaper than conventional designs, has fewer moving parts, and uses durable materials, the engineers say.The device was designed to be placed on top of a vertical tube in the sea. As sea waves pass the tube, the water inside it pushes trapped air above to inflate and deflate the generator placed on top of the device.“As the membrane inflates, a voltage is generated. This increases as the membrane deflates, and electricity is produced. In a commercial device, this electricity would be transported to shore via underwater cables,” the University of Edinburgh said.



The engineers carried out water tests on a smaller scale in a circular tank reproducing any combination of currents and ocean waves. According to the scientists, the device could replace expensive moving parts and complex air turbines.“Wave energy is a potentially valuable resource around Scotland’s coastline, and developing systems that harness this could play a valuable role in producing clean energy for future generations,” Professor David Ingram of the University of Edinburgh’s School of Engineering said.

Iran has launched the third phase of a new refinery, making the country self-sufficient in gasoline production, Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zangeneh said on Monday.At the opening ceremony of the third phase of the Bandar Abbas Gas Condensate Refinery, also called the Persian Gulf Star Refinery, the minister said that Iran’s gasoline production had more than doubled since 2013.Despite holding large crude oil reserves, the Islamic Republic have been importing gasoline for its domestic needs for years, because under the previous Western sanctions, it couldn’t buy spare parts for refinery equipment and maintenance, and because of its low gasoline production capacity.



Last year, before the U.S. withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal imposing new sanctions on Iran, the Islamic Republic was making progress in cutting its gasoline imports and had set gasoline self-sufficiency as a high priority.Most of Iran’s imports came from refiners in India, Southeast Asia, and North Asia. Back in April last year, Iran was aiming to end imports of gasoline by the end of 2018.The three phases of the Persian Gulf Star Refinery, when completed, were expected to produce a total of 55 percent of Iran’s gasoline, in addition to 13.5 million liters per day of diesel.



Speaking at the inauguration of the new refinery unit on Monday, Zangeneh said, as quoted by the oil ministry’s news service Shana:“Today, contrary to what was the case a decade ago that petrol imports could be subject to the sanctions, we are no longer an importer of the item and can even become a petrol exporter and the US cannot have a word to say in this regard.”  Iran could export some of the gasoline, but it will not do it because it wants to boost its domestic stockpiles of the product, the oil minister added, as carried by Shana.

An Austrian natural gas expert has warned Washington and Kremlin they have to set their priorities straight and focus their efforts on reducing the world’s carbon emissions rather than growing their market share on the European gas market.Bloomberg quotes Nebojsa Nakicenovic as saying “We need to be at zero emissions by mid century,” warning there was no time to waste on less important, according to him, issues such as who sells how much natural gas to European consumers.



Nakicenovic was half a century ago a member of a joint U.S-Russian research institute on energy set up to seek ways to avoid an energy crisis. At the time, Nakicenovic and his colleagues at the institute in a way facilitated the natural gas boom in both countries by revising the world’s natural gas resources and in the process fixing the wrong estimates made by the CIA at the time.But now, according to the scientist, the time to lean on gas for energy security is over and what the world needs to do is move away from this and all other fossil fuels.



Nakicenovic is not the only one warning that the time to act is now. Some even believe we have gone beyond the point of no return in climate change and whatever we do now will be too little too late. Yet, in geopolitics natural gas markets and particularly the European gas market remains an important playing field.Russia’s Gazprom has a 40-percent market share in Europe and Trump’s administration wants to challenge that with U.S. LNG exports, which are set to grow substantially over the next few years as more production capacity comes on stream.“Infrastructure is important insomuch as it provides the resilience to the system,” Nakicenovic said during a speech  at the American Association for the Advancement of Science. “More fragmentation through my country first policies,” he added, may have an adverse effect on this resilience.

Russia’s gas giant Gazprom will begin natural gas deliveries to China via the Power of Siberia pipeline ahead of schedule, as early as December 1, 2019, Alexey Miller, Chairman of Gazprom’s Management Committee, has said on a recent visit to China.The Power of Siberia natural gas pipeline was initially expected to start sending gas to China on December 20, 2019, and its completion is among Gazprom’s top priorities.After talks in Beijing with officials of CNPC—with which Gazprom has a 30-year contract for the supply of an annual 1.3 trillion cu ft of natural gas via the Power of Siberia pipeline—Miller said:



“Construction of the Power of Siberia gas pipeline is going ahead of schedule, and Gazprom will start delivering gas to China well in advance, as early as December 1, 2019.”The Power of Siberia gas pipeline will transport natural gas from the Irkutsk and Yakutia production centers to consumers in Russia’s Far East and to China.Gazprom is dominating gas supplies to many European markets while it also vies to meet the surging Chinese natural gas demand as the country is in the middle of a massive switch from coal-fired to gas-fired heating in millions of homes.



In 2018, China’s natural gas imports—including pipeline and liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports—soared by nearly 32 percent from 2017 to a record 90.39 million tons, solidifying China’s position as the world’s biggest importer of the fuel.China became the world’s top natural gas importer—including LNG and pipeline—in October last year, overtaking Japan which imports all its gas as LNG.According to Platts Analytics, China—currently the world’s second-largest LNG importer behind Japan—is set to overtake Japan as the top global LNG importer by 2022 as China will continue to be the largest growth factor behind global LNG demand growth.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Oil Jumps As Saudis Plan Further Production CutsThe Biggest Threat To Oil Market StabilityIs A Natural Gas Cartel Forming?

Indian Oil Corp., the country’s largest oil refiner, has signed its first annual contract for deliveries of crude oil from the United States, Reuters reports, citing a statement by the company’s chairman.IOC will buy an average of 60,000 bpd for a total price of US$1.5 billion in the year to March 2020. The seller is Norway’s Equinor. Previously, Indian Oil Corp. had only bought U.S. crude on the spot market. Last year, Reuters recalls, the company bought 6 million barrels of U.S. crude under a mini-term deal for the period November to January this year.



Most of the oil the refiner imports, however, comes from OPEC under long-term deals, at 75 percent. While this has been the traditional approach, now the company wants to diversify its sources of the commodity, especially in light of the increasingly difficult geopolitical situation.“Lots of geopolitical issues are going around. We expect lots of volume going away from Venezuela, west Africa and Iran, so it makes sense to have guaranteed term supplies from the U.S., where crude production is increasing,” FGE analyst Sri Paravaikkarasu told Reuters.



However, right now India is taking more oil from Venezuela. This month, the country became the largest importer of Venezuelan crude, receiving it at a daily rate of over 600,000 bpd over the first two weeks of February, or up 66 percent from a month ago. The biggest buyers of Venezuelan crude were Reliance Industries and Nyara Energy, in which Rosneft holds a 49-percent stake.Crude oil source diversification is particularly important for India, which is one of the biggest drivers for global oil demand growth. Last month, Wood Mackenzie forecast India’s oil demand will this year continue growing at a rate of 245,000 bpd, the same as last year, when it accounted for 14 percent of global growth.

Gazprombank has reportedly frozen accounts held by Venezuela’s state oil company PDVSA and has stopped conducting transactions involving these accounts on concern of getting penalized under the latest round of U.S. sanctions against PDVSA, Reuters wrote, quoting an unnamed source from the bank.The report follows another one from last week, which said PDVSA was telling the buyers of oil produced by its joint ventures to deposit the money for purchases in a new bank account recently opened at Russia’s Gazprombank.



The report, by Reuters, which said it had seen an internal document pointing in that direction, followed statements from the Venezuelan opposition—whose leader and President of the National Assembly declared himself interim president last month—that a special fund will be set up in the United States where proceeds from the sale of Venezuelan crude would go.However, to make matters more interesting, Gazprombank was quick to deny the Reuters report. RT quoted the bank as saying, “No new accounts have been opened,” adding that the Reuters report “does not reflect the actual situation.” Yet the bank also said PDVSA had several accounts in it, although all of them were opened several years ago.



This time, Gazprombank has not replied to a Reuters request for comment while PDVSA was quick to call the report “fake news” on Twitter. Yet Reuters’ reporters note Russian companies are wary of falling under secondary sanctions for doing direct business with PDVSA, despite the Kremlin’s official support for the Maduro government.Venezuela is still producing over a million barrels of crude daily, but finding buyers for the oil is becoming harder. Since the sanctions went into effect, exports to the U.S. effectively stopped but shipments to India increased: imports there went up by 66 percent to 620,000 bpd, making India the biggest importer of Venezuelan crude.

Kenya broke diplomatic relations with neighbor Somalia after a row over several oil and gas blocks escalated into an open conflict, media report, adding Nairobi expelled the Somali ambassador on Saturday and summoned its own representative in Somalia home.Kenya has accused its neighbor of auctioning oil and gas blocks that fall within Kenyan territory, but Somalia has rejected the accusations, which stem from a long-running maritime border dispute between the two.The authorities in Nairobi said the ""egregious decision by the government of Somalia to auction off oil and gas blocks in Kenya's maritime territorial area that borders Somalia"" caused the recall of its ambassador in Mogadishu and the expulsion of the Somali diplomat, adding the auction was an ""unparalleled affront and illegal grab at the resources of Kenya,"" AFP reports.



Somalia has responded with a statement by the foreign ministry that says ""Somalia is not now offering nor does it have any plans to offer any blocks in the disputed maritime area until the parties' maritime boundary is decided by the ICJ.""The International Court of Justice is currently hearing the case regarding the maritime border between the two Horn of Africa countries.Somalia said last week it will tender several offshore oil and gas blocks later this year despite criticism from the opposition that the tender should wait until the country gets a law and regulations governing the use of the country’s natural resources. Somalia may sit on as much as 1 billion barrels of oil and gas.



Kenya is also a newcomer on the oil stage but it is further along the way: Tullow Oil discovered reserves that could reach 1.2 billion barrels of oil in the Turkana County and is already preparing for commercial production in 2022.For both countries, the newly discovered oil wealth would be an important new source of revenue, so the current spat might be the start of a prolonger bilateral tension.

Mexico will support Pemex by injecting US$3.6 billion into the debt-laden state-held oil firm, including by refinancing debt and cutting taxes, Mexican officials said on Friday.The Mexican government, however, will not take on new debt for Pemex, Reuters quoted officials as saying at a regular press conference.The Mexican state oil firm has a total of US$106 billion in financial debt.



If Pemex needs more capital injection, the government will provide it, according to Finance Minister Carlos Urzua.Mexico’s left-wing President Andrés Manuel López Obrador—in office since December 1—wants a greater role for Pemex in reversing the downward trend in Mexican oil production.Pemex’s crude oil production continues to decline—according to Pemex figures, its crude oil production averaged 1.813 million bpd in 2018. To compare, Pemex’s crude oil production averaged 2.522 million bpd in 2013, falling to 1.948 million bpd in 2017.



López Obrador and Pemex have grand plans for reversing the decline, with the government coming to the rescue of Pemex, as the oil firm itself said in December. A new strategic plan aims to guarantee “the country’s energy security and sovereignty” and targets to raise crude oil production to 2.48 million bpd by the end of this administration’s term in office—the end of 2024.   Last month, Fitch Ratings downgraded Pemex’s ratings to just above investment grade, raising concerns that additional downgrades by Fitch or another rating agency would significantly lift the oil firm’s financing costs while it struggles with a heavy debt load.Fitch Ratings’ downgrade reflected the continued deterioration of Pemex’s standalone credit profile, as a result of persisting negative free cash flow and material under-investment in the company’s upstream business.“The ratings are constrained by PEMEX's substantial tax burden, high leverage, significant unfunded pension liabilities, large capital investment requirements, negative equity and exposure to political interference risk,” Fitch said in January, but noted that it expects that the company will receive necessary support from the government to ensure adequate liquidity and debt service payments.   By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Brent Crude Hits 2019 High At $65Saudi Aramco Makes Existential Bet On Oil‘’Lower Your Costs, Or Die’’ Big Oil’s New Mantra

Due to the U.S. sanctions on Venezuela’s oil industry and state firm PDVSA, one of the world’s largest commodity traders, Trafigura, has decided to halt its oil trade with Venezuela, Reuters reported on Friday, quoting a source with direct knowledge of the plans.Trafigura walking out of oil trading with Venezuela would be a harsh blow to PDVSA, which has been working with Trafigura and other trading houses to sell crude oil and to import refined oil products.In 2018, Trafigura directly lifted 34,000 bpd of crude oil and products from Venezuela, most of which it resold to refineries in the U.S. and China, according to internal documents of PDVSA which Reuters has seen.



The U.S. sanctions now block all payments to PDVSA accounts, and buyers of Venezuelan crude are directed to deposit payments in a separate escrow account, to which PDVSA and the regime of Nicolas Maduro doesn’t have access.Trafigura will stop trading with PDVSA after it completes a small number of trades that have already been concluded, according to Reuters’ source.Some ten days after the U.S. sanctions on Venezuela were imposed, trading houses were still unable to resell Venezuelan crude oil, Reuters reported last week, citing sources and shipping data.



Due to the harsh sanctions, end-users are reluctant to buy Venezuelan crude, and cargoes are being left stranded in the Atlantic basin, according to Refinitiv Eikon data. Trading houses in Europe, including Trafigura and Vitol, regularly offer Venezuelan crude to refiners, but now the commodity traders are finding it hard to find an end user willing to buy.“No one who typically takes Venezuelan crude from us is lifting a single barrel,” a Trafigura trader told Reuters, commenting on the spot market of Venezuelan oil. “Buyers are not sure of the risks and how to ensure any payments are not remitted to PDVSA,” according to the trader.Last week, Trafigura told Reuters that it was following “all applicable sanctions.”By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:US Drillers See Modest Rise In Oil Rigs As Prices HoldHow Blockchain Is Changing The Face Of Oil Trading‘’Lower Your Costs, Or Die’’ Big Oil’s New Mantra

Litasco, the international trading arm of Russia’s second-biggest oil producer Lukoil, stopped its oil swaps deals with Venezuela immediately after the U.S. imposed sanctions on Venezuela’s oil industry and state oil firm PDVSA, Lukoil’s chief executive Vagit Alekperov said at an investment forum in Russia.Russia, which stands by Nicolas Maduro in the ongoing Venezuelan political crisis, has vowed to defend its interests in Venezuela—including oil interests—within the international law using “all mechanisms available to us.”Because of Moscow’s support for Maduro, the international community and market analysts are closely watching the relationship of Russian oil companies with Venezuela.  



“Litasco does not work with Venezuela. Before the restrictions were imposed, Litasco had operations to deliver oil products and to sell oil. There were swap operations. Today there are none, since the sanctions were imposed,” Lukoil’s Alekperov said at the Russian Investment Forum in the Black Sea resort of Sochi.Another Russian oil producer, Gazprom Neft, however, does not see major risks for its oil business in Venezuela, the company’s chief executive officer Alexander Dyukov said at the same event.Gazprom Neft has not supplied and does not supply oil products to Venezuela needed to dilute the thick heavy Venezuelan oil, Dyukov said, noting that the Latin American country hadn’t approached Gazprom Neft for possible supply of oil products for diluents.  



Under the new wide-ranging U.S. sanctions, Venezuela will not be able to import U.S. naphtha which it has typically used to dilute its heavy crude grades. Analysts expect that a shortage of diluents could accelerate beginning this month the already steadily declining Venezuelan oil production and exports. Venezuela’s crude oil production plunged by another 59,000 bpd from December 2018 to stand at just 1.106 million bpd in January 2019, OPEC’s secondary sources figures showed in the cartel’s closely watched Monthly Oil Market Report (MOMR) this week.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:US Drillers See Modest Rise In Oil Rigs As Prices HoldU.S. Biofuel Just Got A Major BumpSaudi Aramco Makes Existential Bet On Oil

Warren Buffett’s investment firm Berkshire Hathaway acquired 10.8 million shares in Canada’s Suncor during the last quarter of 2018, CNBC reports citing a SEC filing. The release of the news pushed the oil company’s stock up by as much as 4 percent.Suncor reported a net loss for the last quarter of 2018, but the operating result of the company was positive, at US$436 million (C$580 million). The company, however, boasted record-breaking production of 740,800 barrels of heavy crude daily and also record refining rates of 467,900 barrels daily over the period.Suncor is the largest oil company in the Canadian oil sands patch and it was a vocal opponent of the Alberta government’s decision to impose mandatory production cuts on local oil companies to stabilize prices.



“Our position is that government intervention in the market would send the wrong signals to the investment community regarding doing business in Alberta and Canada. And we really do need to take a long-term view and allow the market to operate as it should,” a spokeswoman for the company said when the Alberta government began to consider the cuts as a remedy for the huge discount, at one point of over US$50 a barrel, at which Western Canadian Select was trading at to West Texas Intermediate.However this gap has closed faster than initially expected, Suncor CEO Steve Williams said during the company’s 2018 financial results conference call earlier this month. Now, he said, some negative unexpected consequences are making themselves visible.“The differential corrected and overcorrected very quickly and the unintended consequence of that is the potential, the economics are seriously damaged and a lot of the rail movements are stopping or have stopped,” Williams said during the conference call.

Venezuela’s Supreme Tribunal of Justice, the country’s Supreme Court, ordered legal action against individuals that opposition leader Juan Guaido announced as the new board members for PDVSA and its U.S. unit, Citgo.An AFP report quoted the Supreme Court as saying the 15 appointments were made by an authority whose decisions are null, adding that the individuals in question should face legal action on allegations ranging from usurpation and corruption to terrorism.



The Supreme Tribunal of Justice is pro-government. Last month, the same authority banned Juan Guaido from leaving the country and froze his bank accounts after the president of the opposition-dominated National Assembly declared he would assume the position of interim president of Venezuela until new, transparent elections are called.Most of the board appointees, however, are not in Venezuela but in the United States. According to the AFP report, the Supreme Court’s decision should start an extradition process for them, but it’s hard to imagine Washington agreeing to that.



The case of the two PDVSA and Citgo boards has become a focus of attention among those following Venezuelan events. In a recent analysis, Bloomberg’s Davide Scigliuzzo said the “nightmarish legal situation” with Venezuelan government agencies and more importantly PDVSA and Citgo will more likely than not soon end up in a U.S. court. This, he says, means that probably ownership of Citgo will pass into the hands of Guaido.Control of PDVSA’s still profitable refining and fuel retail business in the United States is a priority for the Guaido camp as a source of funding their regime change activities. Yet Citgo itself could find itself in a bit of pickle as PDVSA crude oil exports to its subsidiary decline under the weight of new U.S. sanctions. The refiner would have to look for alternative suppliers of crude and their prices are unlikely to be as low as PDVSA’s.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:BP: Renewables To Become Largest Source Of Power By 2040‘’Lower Your Costs, Or Die’’ Big Oil’s New MantraSaudi Aramco Makes Existential Bet On Oil

Stricter global climate policies could influence Norway’s oil and gas industry and lead to a phase out of oil and gas sooner than previously expected, Oystein Olsen, the Governor of Norway’s central bank Norges Bank, said on Thursday.“We are facing a climate crisis that can only be addressed by engaging in a common global effort,” Olsen said in an address to the Supervisory Council of Norges Bank and invited guests.Demand for fossil fuels is set to decline as consumption patterns shift and production methods move towards lower emissions, the governor of the central bank said.



“This can influence oil and gas activities in Norway. We have always known that oil and gas activities will be phased out sooner or later. Oil and gas are non-renewable resources. A stricter global climate policy may mean that this will occur sooner than foreseen earlier,” he noted.Yet, there is still demand for oil and gas in the world, and Norway’s oil and gas sector will remain profitable “for quite some time,” Olsen said, noting that reducing production offshore Norway earlier than planned would only help other oil suppliers to fill in the gap.“The climate impact of an earlier reduction would therefore be marginal, while the costs to Norway would be substantial,” Olsen said.



The oil industry has been an economic engine in Norway for nearly 50 years and “more than 10 percent of all employed persons in Norway are either directly or indirectly working for the oil industry,” the governor said.Norway’s oil production fell in 2018 compared to 2017 and is further expected to drop this year to its lowest level since 1988.Thanks to the start up in late 2019 of Johan Sverdrup—the North Sea giant, as operator Equinor calls it, oil production is expected to jump in 2020 through 2023. But after Johan Sverdrup and after Johan Castberg in the Barents Sea scheduled for first oil in 2022, Norway doesn’t have major oil discoveries and projects to sustain its oil production level after the middle of the 2020s.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:U.S. Biofuel Just Got A Major BumpRussian Energy Minister: We Avoided $25 Oil With OPEC DealCan U.S. Gas Production Keep Up With Demand?

India will look into commercial considerations and related factors to determine the value of oil imports from any country, an Indian official said on Thursday, after a top U.S. official warned countries against buying oil from Venezuela.Earlier this week, U.S. National Security Advisor John Bolton warned countries and companies against buying crude oil from Venezuela, after the Latin American country’s Oil Minister Manuel Quevedo said during a surprise visit to India that Venezuela wants to sell more oil to the fast-growing Indian market.In a tweet with a Bloomberg article on Venezuelan-Indian oil relations attached, Bolton wrote: “Nations and firms that support Maduro’s theft of Venezuelan resources will not be forgotten. The United States will continue to use all of its powers to preserve the Venezuelan people’s assets and we encourage all nations to work together to do the same.”



Raveesh Kumar, the spokesman of India’s Ministry of External Affairs, said at a press briefing on Thursday, as carried by Sputnik:“Venezuela is the chair of OPEC and GECF. We don't have any barter system with Venezuela; commercial considerations and related factors will determine the value of trade which we have with any country.”At the start of the Venezuelan political crisis last month, Indian media reported that the Asian country continues to be one of the main buyers of Venezuelan crude oil. Indian refiners are still buying more than 400,000 bpd of oil from the troubled Latin American country, which is sitting on the world’s largest crude oil resources.Related: Which Oil Giant Generates The Most Cash?



While the U.S. and many European nations have recognized opposition leader Juan Guaidó as the interim president of Venezuela, India has only limited itself to issuing a statement that “We are of the view that it is for the people of Venezuela to find political solution to resolve their differences through constructive dialogue and discussion without resorting to violence.”  “We believe democracy, peace and security in Venezuela are of paramount importance for the progress and prosperity of the people of Venezuela. India and Venezuela enjoy close and cordial relations,” is the official position of India, which the spokesman of India’s Ministry of External Affairs, Kumar, repeated at the briefing today.

The Niger Delta Avengers (NDA)—the militant group responsible for most of the attacks on Nigeria’s oil infrastructure in 2016—resurfaced days before the Nigerian presidential elections this weekend, saying that they are backing the opposition candidate and would attack oil facilities if incumbent president Muhammadu Buhari is re-elected.“We are adopting Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, as the sole candidate to be voted for by all the people of the Niger Delta as a result of his political ideology which is in tandem with our agitation for equitable and fair principal of federalism,” NDA spokesperson Mudoch Agbinibo said.The NDA have been demanding that a higher share of the oil revenues from the Delta be shared among the local impoverished communities.



The ‘avengers’ also had a warning to their preferred candidate Abubakar—if elected, to start restructuring in Nigeria “within six (6) months to forestall further agitation from the Niger Delta.”Nigeria’s opposition presidential candidate Abubakar promises to boost Nigerian upstream oil and gas production and downstream production by attracting more investments, if he is elected president in this weekend’s elections.Related: U.S. Solar Industry Gains 150,000 Jobs In Eight YearsAbubakar, presidential candidate of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), is running against Buhari, under whose watch Nigeria’s economy suffered from the low oil prices that reduced export revenues. Nigeria’s oil industry also suffered from vandalism and militant attacks on oil infrastructure in most of 2016 and early 2017, for most of which the NDA claimed responsibility.



The militants have been silent for just over a year, after they threatened in January 2018 to attack oil infrastructure in Nigeria “in a few days time.” Those threats never materialized, and Nigeria was able to lift its production to the point of being included in the new round of OPEC cuts that began last month.In the previous OPEC/non-OPEC production cut agreement in 2017, Nigeria was exempted due to the militant violence, most of which coming from NDA, that had crippled its production to a 30-year low in 2016—to 1.1 million bpd. According to OPEC’s secondary sources, Nigeria’s crude oil production rose by 52,000 bpd from December 2018 to 1.792 million bpd in January 2019, due to the start-up of Total’s ultra-deepwater oil field Egina.  By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Maduro Says Oil Output Will Rise By 1 Million BpdOil Rises Despite Rising Oil, Product InventoriesGoldman: ‘Shock And Awe’ OPEC Cuts To Send Oil Higher Soon

France’s Total is the first international oil major to invest in Saudi Arabia’s fuel retail market after signing a deal with oil giant Saudi Aramco to invest US$1 billion over six years in fuel and retail services in the Kingdom.As Oilprice.com’s Cyril Widdershoven said on January 21, the French supermajor and Aramco are setting up a 50/50 joint venture to provide premium fuels in Saudi Arabia. This news was confirmed by Total said on Thursday.“This joint venture agreement is in line with our global strategy to expand in fast-growing markets worldwide,” said Momar Nguer, President Marketing and Services and Executive Committee Member at Total.



The deal also strengthens the Total-Aramco partnership in the Saudi downstream market, Nguer noted.“The JV will take a phased approach to expanding its network of domestic fuel retail stations, with a plan to reach the goal of owning and operating hundreds of stations by 2021,” Saudi Aramco said in its statement.The Saudi giant and the French group are already partners in several large-scale projects in Saudi Arabia.

The project will entail investments of around US$5 billion and is planned to start up in 2024.Saudi Aramco aims to significantly expand its downstream business to capture the oil demand growth in the coming decades, which is expected to come mainly from chemicals and petrochemicals.“Saudi Aramco will make the most of those prospects with chemicals investments of more than $100 billion over the next 10 years—not including a prospective acquisition. We are expanding this business both in Saudi Arabia and in fast-growing overseas markets like China and India, with the aim of converting two million barrels per day of crude oil into petrochemicals—and we may eventually move our target higher to three million barrels,” the company’s president and chief executive officer Amin Nasser said in November 2018.

The BOEM has scheduled a region-wide oil and gas lease sale for the Gulf of Mexico, in which it will offer a total 14,696 blocks spanning 78 million acres, which constitutes all the available unleased acreage in federal waters in the Gulf.“Developing our nation’s offshore energy resources is vital to our economy and energy security,” the Acting Director of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Walter Cruickshank said. “Our staff is committed to ensuring offshore development is done in an environmentally responsible manner.”



The March lease sale is part of the 2017-2022 offshore lease sale plan – the National Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program – that was approved by the second Obama administration.The U.S. outer continental shelf holds technically recoverable reserves estimated at 550 million barrels of oil and 1.25 trillion cu ft of natural gas. The Gulf of Mexico was made the focus of the 2017-2022 plan because of the consistent interest of oil and gas explorers in the area, the high resource potential, and not least, the extensiveness of production infrastructure, a statement from the Department of the Interior from 2017 said. During this period, the Bureau of Land Management will hold two lease sales for the Gulf of Mexico every year.



The Gulf of Mexico contains an estimated 48 billion barrels of technically recoverable crude oil and 141 trillion cu ft of technically recoverable natural gas. Despite the rise of the shale plays in the last two decades, the Gulf has remained a major contributor to the national total in oil and gas production, with oil companies constantly improving their exploration and extraction technology to boost yields and cut costs, making offshore projects more competitive with shale. The Gulf also has an extensive production and transportation infrastructure, which is an additional incentive for oil and gas players to expand their presence there.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Looming Elections Could Exacerbate Alberta’s Pipeline ProblemsGoldman: ‘Shock And Awe’ OPEC Cuts To Send Oil Higher SoonOil Rises Despite Rising Oil, Product Inventories

The first grid-scale battery storage system in India launched this month, marking the first step of one of the world’s largest energy users to a future in which renewable energy is set to feature more prominently.The project was the work of a partnership between AES, India’s Tata Power, and Mitsubishi. The facility has a capacity of 10MW/MWh and was built by Fluence, the energy storage venture of AES and Germany’s Siemens.



“Battery-based energy storage has an essential role to play in helping India realize its vision for a more sustainable energy future,” AES’ chief executive, Andres Gluski, said in the company’s press release, adding the facility—a first for South Asia—will “open the market for the use of battery storage technology in India.”India has been late in joining the renewables party, but it now has very ambitious plans in this respect. By 2025, the government plans to have installed renewable capacity of 225 GW. This year alone, the country’s installed renewable energy capacity is set for a 50-percent jump from 2018, with 15.86 GW in new installations. Utility-scale solar facilities will rise to 10.9 GW this year, from 6.83 GW in 2018.



To date, India’s installed renewable energy capacity stands at 75 GW, and projects under construction come in at 46 GW. Tenders for new capacity will reach 500 GW by 2028, of which 350 GW will be solar capacity projects. That’s a major increase in the available capacity, but it is necessary: India’s energy demand will hit 840 GW by 2030 provided its economy expands at an average annual rate of 6.5 percent as economic forecasts have it.The country is uncomfortably reliant on imported oil, so in addition to pursuing an increase in domestic oil production, it is turning to renewables as a cost-competitive and more sustainable alternative to fossil fuels.

Venezuela’s oil production could feasibly fall to just 500,000 barrels per day by year’s end, according to the US State Department’s Special Envoy to Venezuela in a Wednesday hearing on the crisis-stricken Latin American nation on Wednesday. The cause for the expected production declines, said Rep. Elliot Abrams, was the impact of US sanctions on Venezuela’s state-run oil company, PDVSA.  The crisis in Venezuela, of which its floundering oil industry is merely one part,  is “entirely manmade”, according to House Committee on Foreign Affairs Chairman Eliot L. Engel, who is also the Co-Chair of the House Oil and National Security Caucus, a champion for US energy independence, and serves on the Commission for Human Rights, who today did not mince words when he laid blame for the Venezuelan  disaster squarely on Nicolas Maduro’s and Hugo Chavez’s doorstep. Two leaders, Engel said, who “have driven the country off the edge of the cliff.”



In his opening remarks as chairman, Engel went on to definitively dispel the notion that US military intervention in Venezuela could possibly be used in the future, despite what he referred to as President Donald Trump’s “sabre rattling” on the issue, stressing that such action would require Congressional approval, which would never be given.Despite that preface for Wednesday’s hearing, a heated exchange between Rep. Elliot Abrams and Rep. Ilhar Omar sprung up, with Rep. Omar asking of Abrams, “Yes or no, would you support an armed faction within Venezuela that engages in war crimes, crimes against humanity or geocide if you believe they were serving US interest, as you did in Guatemala, El Salvador, and Nicaragua?” To which Abrams refused to reply.Related: Oil Rises Despite Rising Oil, Product InventoriesVenezuela’s oil production—which accounts for 95% of the country’s export revenues—is but a shadow of its former glory days of 3 million barrels per day as it was in 1997. By 2017 its production had fallen to 2 million bpd, and by this time last year, Venezuela’s production had fallen again to 1.5 million bpd. 



According to OPEC’s latest monthly oil market report, Venezuela’s production last month fell to 1.1 million bpd.Depending on what point is being made, one could believe that Maduro and Chavez are responsible for the inexorable production decline in Venezuela, who has hundreds of billions of barrels in oil reserves. One could also believe the US back patting that suggests its new round of US sanctions levied in January on Venezuela is the cause of the reduced oil output by tying the hands of its customers, and by holding back shipments of the essential diluent that Venezuela needs to keep the oil flowing.Should its oil output indeed sink to 500,000 bpd by the end of this year, customers of Venezuela’s heavy oil, including India and the United States, may find it hard to purchase a suitable heavy substitute, as all oil is not equal.

Turkish exploration ships will soon start drilling for oil and gas offshore the northern part of Cyprus, the energy minister of the Turkish Cypriots told Turkish Anadolu Agency on Wednesday, a move that could reignite tension between Turkey, Cyprus, and Greece regarding the exploration rights off the eastern Mediterranean island.Turkey, which recognizes the northern Turkish Cypriot government and doesn’t have diplomatic relations with the internationally recognized government of Cyprus, claims that part of the Cyprus offshore area is under the jurisdiction of Turkish Cypriots or Turkey.“We will protect the rights and interests of the Turkish Cypriots and take the necessary steps on the issue of natural gas, just as we do on other issues,” Ozdil Nami, the energy minister of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC), told Anadolu Agency.



The president of the Republic of Cyprus, Nicos Anastasiades, has proposed that the Turkish Cypriots keep their share of the oil and gas income in a special fund until a solution to the divided island of Cyprus is reached. The Turkish Cypriot energy minister Nami, however, called this proposal “irrational and illogical,” according to Anadolu Agency.“Turkey is the easiest, most economical and fastest route in transporting natural gas extracted in the eastern Mediterranean to Europe,” Nami told the Turkish news agency.Turkey will not allow other countries to drill for gas in Turkish or northern Cyprus waters in the eastern Mediterranean, Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan warned in November, while both Turkey and Cyprus were getting ready to drill in the area where the countries have overlapping claims of maritime territories.   



ExxonMobil planned to begin drilling for oil and gas offshore Cyprus in the fourth quarter last year, while Turkey warned against exploration offshore Cyprus in what it says is ignoring the rights of the Turkish Cypriot people.Exxon has found a commercially viable oil reservoir in Block 10 offshore Cyprus, Greek newspaper Kathimerini Cyprus reported last week, citing sources with knowledge of the matter. Official results from Exxon are not expected until the end of this week, Kathimerini Cyprus said last week.

Uganda expects to start pumping oil in 2022, later than a previous target for 2021, because of lack of infrastructure and disagreements over taxes and plans with operators.Uganda is now looking to begin production by 2022, from the Kingfisher and Tilenga blocks, Energy Minister Irene Muloni told Reuters on the sidelines of an energy conference in India.Uganda is one of the hot spots for oil development in sub-Saharan Africa. A newcomer on the oil scene, the landlocked country has welcomed Tullow Oil, CNOOC, and Total in its oil-rich regions. The country’s government sees investments of US$15-20 billion made into its oil industry during the next three to four years and plans to build a pipeline to the Tanzanian coast and a refinery to jumpstart an oil industry.



Uganda will have to build first a pipeline to export its oil and a refinery before starting oil production, minister Muloni told Reuters on Wednesday.A final investment decision for the refinery would be made in September 2020 and it is planned to be ready three years later, she said.The Uganda-Tanzania pipeline is planned to run from Hoima, Uganda, to Tanzania’s Port of Tanga. The financing for the project will come 70 percent from the governments of Tanzania and Uganda, with the remaining 30 percent from Tullow Oil and CNOOC. France’s Total also co-owns part of Uganda’s oilfields, and may be negotiating for a stake in the pipeline project. However, the Ugandan government said in December that the pipeline could be delayed as its investors hold out for a higher tariff, beyond the $12.20 per barrel tariff originally agreed upon.Related: Oil Rises Despite Rising Oil, Product Inventories



In its 2018 results release on Wednesday, Tullow Oil said that theEnvironmental Social Impact Assessments (ESIAs) for both Tilenga and Kingfisher were submitted to the National Environmental Management Authority for review, with approval expected in the first half this year.“Project financing for the pipeline is progressing well with the development of the financial model ongoing. In the first half of 2019, the JV Partners anticipate completing key commercial, technical and land agreements with the Governments of Uganda and Tanzania as well as the submission of an ESIA for the pipeline to both Governments,” Tullow Oil said today.

U.S. National Security Advisor John Bolton has warned countries and companies against buying crude oil from Venezuela, after the Latin American country’s Oil Minister Manuel Quevedo said during a surprise visit to India that Venezuela wants to sell more oil to the fast-growing Indian market.In a tweet with a Bloomberg article on Venezuelan-Indian oil relations attached, Bolton wrote: “Nations and firms that support Maduro’s theft of Venezuelan resources will not be forgotten. The United States will continue to use all of its powers to preserve the Venezuelan people’s azsets and we encourage all nations to work together to do the same.”“We have a good relationship with India and we want to continue this relationship. The relationships with India will continue, the trade will continue and we will simply expand all the trade and relationship,” Indian outlet Business Today quoted the Venezuelan minister as saying on the sidelines of the Petrotech conference in India this week.



At the start of the Venezuelan political crisis last month, Indian media reported that the Asian country continues to be one of the main buyers of Venezuelan crude oil. Indian refiners keep buying more than 400,000 bpd of oil from the troubled Latin American country, which is sitting on the world’s largest crude oil resources.In separate Venezuela-and-sanctions-related news, Bulgarian security officials said on Wednesday that they had blocked several bank accounts in a local bank that have received millions of euros from Venezuela’s state oil firm PDVSA, on which the U.S. slapped sweeping sanctions at the end of January.Bulgaria’s security services and prosecutor’s office were tipped off by the U.S. about those money transfers and have blocked transfers out of the bank accounts.



“We have established that there were money transfers from Venezuela, namely from the state oil company of Venezuela to these accounts,” Reuters quoted Bulgaria’s chief prosecutor Sotir Tsatsarov as telling reporters.The security officials will be looking into those accounts before deciding whether to press charges on money laundering, the prosecutor noted.

In a sign things for the oil industry in Canada’s oil industry are improving, albeit slowly, bankruptcies in the industry last year declined by as much as 50 percent compared with 2017, data from the Office of the Superintendant of Bankruptcy showed.Only 15 bankruptcies took place in Canada’s oil and gas extraction sector, versus 30 a year earlier as prices continued to recover from the 2014 collapse despite specific challenges hat still remain, mainly pipeline capacity shortages and costly railway transport of crude.Yet the situation with oil prices was not the only one that drove the substantial decline in bankruptcies, the Calgary Herald reports. The daily quoted David Lewis, member of the Canadian Association of Insolvency and Restructuring Professionals as saying some bakruptcies may have been simply delayed in anticipation of an important ruling by the Supreme Court.



The ruling was on a case involving a bankrupt oil company Redwater Energy, and had to prescribe whose responsibility it is to clean up inactive oil wells. The ruling came out in January, with the Court taking the side of the Alberta government and the Alberta Energy Regulator, which argued this responsibility lay with the bankrupt company’s trustee.“Either the companies or their main creditors may have been holding off on doing anything, because until a decision on Redwater was made on whether you had to do a cleanup or not, it made a big difference on what they may receive as a payout,” the expert said.Despite the improving performance of oil companies, the situation in the overall economy of Alberta remains rather dire, with individual insolvencies in the oil province rising last year by a tenth from 2017.



Unemployment rates remain high and Alberta has the highest debt per capita, according to Lewis. This suggests one of the biggest employers in the province still cannot afford to expand its workforce to pre-crisis levels, regardless of improving oil prices.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Hedge Funds Unsure Where Oil Prices Are GoingOil Market Tightens On OPEC CutsThe Renewable Revolution Has A Lithium Problem

Executives from major U.S. nuclear energy companies met with President Trump yesterday to ask for the administration’s help in expanding abroad, Bloomberg reports, citing sources in the know.It seems U.S. nuclear plant builders feel left out of an international race that could be very profitable.“There is competition around the globe, and we want to be part of it,” Bloomberg quoted the chief executive of Exelon Corp., Chris Crane, as saying.



The help that the industry is seeking from the government involves “financial assistance” to make their products more competitive with other companies that are already receiving financial support from the governments, notably Russian and Chinese companies, but also French reactor builders. All these are also on an international expansion drive.“The United States needs to maintain a leadership position,” Exelon’s Crane told media after the meeting. “There’s a huge economic upside for jobs -- manufacturing jobs, operating jobs, engineering jobs -- that can be created in us playing a more stronger role in the international economy.”The U.S. nuclear industry is hard pressed to find new markets as local power plants age and become uncompetitive with renewable energy installations, following the path of coal-powered plants. Since the domestic market seems to be saturated with nuclear plants, the only viable option is expanding abroad.



Also, approval for new reactor technology would come in handy. The industry is working on next-generation reactors as well as smaller, modular nuclear reactor technology--but these need to be approved at the highest level before joining the competition.The International Energy Agency forecasts the world will need 554 GW of new nuclear power generation capacity by 2030. That’s 42 percent more than the world’s current capacity. As in many other respects, China and India will spearhead this demand increase, with the IEA expecting nuclear power generation globally to rise by 46 percent between now and 2040, with the two Asian economies accounting for 90 percent of this rise.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Oil Jumps As Saudis Plan Further Production CutsThe Biggest Threat To Oil Market StabilityIs A Natural Gas Cartel Forming?

New Mexico received US$2.2 billion in revenues from oil production last year, data from the state’s Tax Research Institute showed. This was a 26-percent increase on the year, or US$465 million. The total amount represented 32.3 percent of the New Mexico State General Fund recurring revenue.According to a report of the news in the Albuquerque Journal, a substantial increase in investments and production in the state contributed to the revenue increase, as did higher oil prices, despite the fluctuations throughout the year.



New Mexico, together with Texas, is home to the Permian, the shale oil and gas play that has seen the strongest increase in interest, investment, and production over the last few years thanks to many low-cost production spots. That’s despite warnings from industry experts that the low-cost sweet spots are already taken and production costs will only rise.Still, oil and gas companies, and private equity firms are flocking to the Permian and drillers are pumping, which most recently caused pipeline bottlenecks that pressured the prices of Permian crude. The bottlenecks are being addressed, however, and soon the play will have more oil-moving capacity.



The Permian is an outperformer: between 2017 and 2018, crude oil production shot up by as much as 860,000 bpd to 2.76 million bpd, energy investment expert Nawar Alsaadi noted in a recent analysis for Oilprice, but this may lead many to assume that this performance is the norm across shale plays.This is not the case, however, Alsaadi warns. Exploitation of the oil and gas reserves of the Permian only began in 2013, a year before the oil price crash, unlike legacy shale plays such as the Eagle for and Bakken. In fact, he says, the Permian is what helped the United States win the price war with OPEC. The play has been the biggest contributor to the inexorable rise in U.S. oil production and this will it will keep this role, with the national total seen rising to 12.4 million bpd this year, according to the latest Short-Term Energy Outlook by the Energy Information Administration.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Fifty Shades Of Shale OilOPEC’s Next Big CrisisTexas Oil Production Breaks New Record

The American Petroleum Institute (API) reported a small crude oil inventory draw of 998,000 barrels for the week ending February 8, close to analyst expectations that predicted a build in crude oil inventories to the tune of 2.300 million barrels.Last week, the API reported a surprise crude build of 2.514 million barrels. A day later, the EIA confirmed the inventory build, but a smaller one at 1.3 million barrels. Oil prices were trading up on the day prior to the data released on Tuesday as OPEC’s heavyweight Saudi Arabia promised to cut even deeper both oil production and exports in the month of March. Saudi Arabia’s Energy Minister, Khalid al-Falih, said that Saudi Arabia would taper oil production down to 9.8 million barrels per day in March, or roughly 500,000 below its production quota under the OPEC+ deal reached last month.



At 2:51pm EST on Tuesday, WTI was trading $0.69 up on the day (+1.32%) per barrel at $53.10—a rise of on the day but a decrease week on week. Brent crude was trading up $0.95 (+1.54%) at $62.46—up slightly week on week.    The API this week reported a build in gasoline inventories for week ending February 8 in the amount of 746,000 barrels. Analysts were close in their predictions, estimating a build of 508,000 barrels for the week.US crude oil production as estimated by the Energy Information Administration showed that production for the week ending February 1—the latest information available—averaged 11.9 million barrels per day for the fourth week in a row.



Distillate inventories decreased this week by 2.481 million barrels, compared to a smaller expected draw of 1.090 million barrels.Crude oil inventories at the Cushing, Oklahoma facility fell by 502,000 barrels for the week.The U.S. Energy Information Administration report on crude oil inventories is due to be released on Wednesday at 10:30a.m. EST.By 4:35pm EST, WTI was trading up at $53.05 and Brent was trading up at $62.40.

In an oil market already tighter on heavy crude grades due to OPEC’s production cuts and U.S. sanctions on Iran’s oil, refiners now face an even tighter supply of heavy crude with the sweeping U.S. sanctions on Venezuela’s oil sector.Refiners around the world are looking for alternatives to Venezuela’s heavy and extra heavy crudes, but Venezuelan grades have few suitable substitutes, Reuters market analyst John Kemp writes. In addition, heavier, higher-sulfur grades are more difficult to process and refiners must first see if their refineries will be suited to process substitutes of Venezuelan grades.The closest replacement to Venezuela’s Merey grade, for example, would be Brazil’s Marlim, Mexico’s Maya, Canada’s grades Bow River and Cold Lake, or Iraq’s Basra Heavy, according to Kemp.



The sanctions on Venezuela—combined with the U.S. sanctions on Iran and with OPEC’s cuts—have been removing medium to heavy crudes from the market. This has led to the point that the benchmark Middle East prices for higher-sulfur sour grades have recently increased to above the price of Brent Crude in a rare occurrence in the oil market, where lower-sulfur, sweet grades from the Atlantic basin and the North Sea are typically more expensive than the sour grades from the Middle East or Latin America.Although the U.S. sanctions on Venezuela are creating a heavy crude crunch on the oil market, the EIA says that the sanctions are unlikely to have a significant impact on the refinery runs of the U.S. refiners.Related: Maduro Asks OPEC For Help As U.S. Sanctions BiteThose sanctions will essentially eliminate U.S. imports of Venezuelan crude oil as the full effects of the sanctions emerge, the EIA said last week, but noted that it doesn’t expect “any significant decrease in U.S. refinery runs as a result of these sanctions.”



Imports of crude oil from Venezuela are still a significant portion of the U.S. Gulf Coast imports, but they have been falling in recent years due to the collapsing Venezuelan oil production.“Moving forward, refineries may also choose to run lighter crude oils because transportation constraints may limit the availability of heavy crude oils,” according to the EIA.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Is A Natural Gas Cartel Forming?Venezuela’s Oil Production Could Fall Below 700,000 Bpd Next YearU.S. Sanctions, OPEC Cuts Create Rare Oil Price Shakeup

Despite opposition from U.S. President Donald Trump to closure of coal-fired power plants, the Tennessee Valley Authority is proposing to retire two coal plants by 2023, due to flat power demand challenging the coal plants’ profitability.According to the Tennessee Valley Authority’s (TVA) assessment, reported by Chattanooga Times Free Press, the Bull Run Fossil Plant in Oak Ridge and the Unit 3 generator at the Paradise Fossil Plant (PAF) in Kentucky should shut down.“Assets that have relatively high projected future maintenance costs and environmental compliance expenditures, a high forced outage rate and poor generation portfolio fit, have been the focus of more detailed study for potential retirement. PAF falls into this category of assets,” the TVA says in a document examining the potential retirement of the Paradise coal plant, as provided by Chattanooga Times.



The TVA board is meeting on Thursday to discuss the fate of the two coal-fired power plants.President Trump has been opposing the closure of coal plants and has been trying to prop up coal since he took office.On Monday, President Trump tweeted “Coal is an important part of our electricity generation mix and @TVAnews should give serious consideration to all factors before voting to close viable power plants, like Paradise #3 in Kentucky!”



Replying to President Trump’s tweet, the TVA tweeted later: “This is our response to the President's tweet earlier this evening: Mr. President, coal is an important part of TVA’s power generation mix and we will give serious consideration to all factors as we make this decision.”In recent years, the rise of natural gas and renewables has been challenging coal plants, some of which have struggled to stay afloat amid stagnating power demand.In its latest inventory of electric generators, the EIA said last month that wind, natural gas, and solar capacity will lead the new electricity capacity in the United States in 2019, while coal-fired generation will account for more than half of scheduled capacity retirements.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:South Africa Oil Discovery Could Be A Game-ChangerThe Renewable Revolution Has A Lithium ProblemWhich Oil Giant Generates The Most Cash?

Germany will likely build two terminals to import liquefied natural gas (LNG), Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said on Tuesday, in a move to appease the U.S. while Berlin also supports the Russia-led Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which has divided the European Union member states in recent years.“Germany and the US share an interest in secure and dependable energy supplies,” the AFP quoted Altmaier as saying in a statement on Monday, on the eve of his meeting with U.S. Deputy Secretary of Energy Dan Brouillette.The U.S. has long opposed the Gazprom-led Nord Stream 2 pipeline. Several EU member states, including Poland and Lithuania, also see the new pipeline project as a threat to Europe’s energy diversification and as boosting Russia’s grip on European gas supplies even more.



Germany, however, is the end-point of the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which will follow the existing Nord Stream natural gas pipeline between Russia and Germany via the Baltic Sea. Germany supports Nord Stream 2 and sees the project as a private commercial venture that will help it to meet rising natural gas demand.Several European companies—ENGIE, OMV, Shell, as well as Germany’s Uniper and Wintershall—are partners of Russia’s gas giant Gazprom in the Nord Stream 2 project. Speaking at an LNG Import Conference in Berlin today, German Economy Minister Altmaier said that all three proposed projects for LNG import terminals in Germany are being carefully considered.



“I am quite optimistic that at least two of the terminals will be realised within a very foreseeable period of time,” Reuters quoted Altmaier as saying.The German minister also stressed that LNG terminals and imports are a completely separate issue from Nord Stream 2.Meanwhile, the U.S. Deputy Secretary of Energy Brouillette tweeted from the Berlin conference: “Energy security requires energy diversity - a diversity of supply, countries providing that supply, and routes for that supply. The US supports Germany’s efforts to increase energy diversity through the construction of LNG shipping terminals - hopefully a destination for US LNG!”By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:An Unexpected Bullish Factor For OilRosneft Boss Wants Russia Out Of OPEC DealWhich Oil Giant Generates The Most Cash?

Shell and Eni were among the companies awarded oil exploration licenses in Egypt’s latest oil and gas tender, Reuters reports, adding the two companies along with Exxon, BP, and Petronas were also awarded licenses for natural gas exploration.The government awarded a total 12 licenses, with the minimum investment seen at between US$750 million and US$800 million.



Earlier this week, Bloomberg reported that Egypt was putting the final touches to a new type of contract aimed at incentivizing oil and gas majors to spend more on exploration in the North African country.“We’re improving the cost-recovery process to be faster, less bureaucratic and more efficient,” oil minister Tarek el-Molla told Bloomberg in an interview, as Egypt pursues its ambitions in the oil and gas industry, planning to become a major natural gas exporter.



Energy companies have committed some US$10 billion to exploration in Egypt this year, but this could just be the start if the new contract terms do their job. Currently, foreign companies operating in Egypt do so under production sharing agreements that leave a third of the oil and gas produced by foreign companies in the country for them, to cover their exploration and production expenses. The rest is divided between the operators and the Egyptian government with the latter entitled to buy the companies’ share at a predetermined price.This is not optimal for international oil companies who have voiced their dissatisfaction with the PSAs more than once. Although El-Molla did not provide details about the new contracts in his interview for Bloomberg, the news outlet last year cited sources as saying part of the contract overhaul involved a stipulation allowing field operators to make their own decisions about what to do with their share of the output.Egypt will carry out another tender for oil and gas blocks later this quarter, the oil minister also said during his interview.

The Environmental Protection Agency may not include limits on biofuel credit trading in its new draft proposal on gasoline sales, Reuters reports, citing three unnamed sources in the know.The limits were proposed by the American Petroleum Institute last year as an alternative to lifting a current ban on the sales of E-15 gasoline during driving season. E-15 contains 15 percent of bioethanol, which is higher than the usual 10 percent for other blends. It has been banned during the summer months on worries that it worsens smog.



At the time, the API argued that lifting the ban, which was part of a plan to appease the energy and ethanol lobbies by President Trump, would be unfair to consumers. “This so-called deal does nothing to fix the program ... it makes things worse,” the industry body said. “It is giving away the store to the ethanol lobby and giving the consumers the tab.”The problem for the oil industry is that refiners have to blend rising amounts of ethanol in their fuels every year or, alternatively, buy higher-ethanol blends from their competitors. These are the so-called biofuel credits, or Renewable Identification Numbers, that are giving refiners grief with their heightened price volatility in recent years.



“The EPA has been seriously looking at dropping the RIN reform to speed up the process on E15,” one of the Reuters sources said. Another said the authority would delay the biofuel credit trading limits reform and focus on E-15 sales for the time being.Last year, amid ongoing discussions between refiners and the administration regarding the biofuel credit trade, energy industry commentator Robert Rapier noted that oil refiners have spent billions complying with the Renewable Fuel Standard. Valero alone said in 2017 it had splashed more than US$1 billion on compliance. If the EPA now goes with the ethanol industry and against refiners, this disgruntlement will only deepen.

Venezuela’s troubled state oil company PDVSA is pressuring its joint venture partners to strengthen their commitment to their joint projects, Reuters reports, citing unnamed sources.The company has insisted that its partners from Europe and the United States publicly declare whether they will continue participating in the joint ventures amid more U.S. sanctions. This participation has become uncertain as the latest round of sanctions has made it more difficult for PDVSA’s partners to transfer cash out of Venezuela and also to market the oil the joint ventures produce.



PDVSA’s partners in the Orinoco Belt, where most of its heavy crude reserves are concentrated, include Total, Equinor, Rosneft, and Chevron, as well as China’s CNPC. Earlier this year, PDVSA also struck two new production deals, one with a U.S. company and one with a French one, to help reverse a consistent and growing decline in production.The terms of the joint ventures are changing, however. A Reuters report from earlier this month said PDVSA had begun mixing its extra heavy crude with locally produced light oil as imported diluents from the United States are now hard to come by. Normally, according to Reuters, the joint venture partners would market their production separately, but now the mixed crude was being delivered to PDVSA for exports as a way around U.S. sanctions.



The four joint ventures between PDVSA and Total, Equinor, Rosneft, and Chevron operate four heavy crude upgraders that have a total capacity of 700,000 bpd. This is more than two-thirds of Venezuela’s oil production, which is currently around 1.1 million bpd but could drop to about 900,000 bpd if no action is taken to stop the decline, a Wood Mac analyst warned recently.The companies are very likely—and understandably--reluctant to make a commitment in such a complex situation. Total, however, has already said it could continue working in Venezuela, even though the French company evacuated its foreign workers and has complained about its bank accounts getting blocked.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Which Oil Giant Generates The Most Cash?Green New Deal Critics See RedU.S. Sanctions, OPEC Cuts Create Rare Oil Price Shakeup

Oil prices rallied 2 percent early on Tuesday after OPEC’s largest producer and de facto leader Saudi Arabia signaled even deeper cuts in production and exports of the Kingdom for March.At 07:30 a.m. EST on Tuesday, WTI Crude was trading up 1.87 percent at $53.39, while Brent Crude was rallying 2.21 percent at $62.87.In an interview with the Financial Times published on Tuesday, Saudi Arabia’s Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said that the Saudis would cut production to around 9.8 million bpd in March, some 500,000 bpd below the commitment in the OPEC+ deal that began in January.



Under the OPEC/non-OPEC deal for a total of 1.2 million bpd cuts between January and June, Saudi Arabia’s share is a cut of 322,000 bpd from the October level of 10.633 million, to reduce output to 10.311 million bpd.At the end of January, al-Falih said that Saudi Arabia’s February crude oil production would likely be close to 10.1 million bpd, down from around 10.2 million bpd for January. Since December, Saudi Arabia has cut close to 1 million bpd in production and exports, and this “will trickle down the markets over the next few weeks,” al-Falih told Bloomberg Television in an interview at the end of last month.In his most recent interview, with the FT, the energy minister of OPEC’s largest producer and top global oil exporter also said that Saudi Arabia would be cutting its crude oil exports to near 6.9 million bpd next month, slashed from 8.2 million bpd just three months ago.



Market participants continue to weigh supply-side factors such as tighter supply from OPEC and its Russia-led non-OPEC allies against rising U.S. crude oil production, U.S. sanctions on Venezuela and the battle over Libya’s largest oil field Sharara, which has been shut in for more than two months now.Equity, bond, and oil markets are also closely monitoring the U.S.-China trade talks for clues whether a deal can be hammered out before the March 1 deadline of the ‘trade war truce’.

OPEC’s biggest producer Saudi Arabia would need oil prices at US$80-85 per barrel in order to balance its 2019 budget, Jihad Azour, Director of the Middle East and Central Asia Department at the International Monetary Fund (IMF), has told Reuters.  Saudi Arabia’s officials, including Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih, don’t discuss publicly ‘targeted oil prices’ or a desired level of oil prices that would be comfortable to the Kingdom’s finances, but analysts and the IMF have estimates what oil price level would be enough to cover Saudi Arabia’s budget spending.  For this year, “if you take the (2019) budget as presented with everything remaining equal, a breakeven point would be around $80-$85 dollars,” the IMF’s Azour told Reuters.



The oil price slump in the fourth quarter of 2018 has certainly affected the public finances of the biggest oil exporting nations, including OPEC’s biggest, Saudi Arabia.  Although Azour doesn’t see the price slump affecting the Kingdom’s ability to finance itself, he expects that those lower prices would weigh on the fiscal position of Saudi Arabia.For this year, the Kingdom announced its highest-ever budget, of around US$295 billion (1.1 trillion Saudi riyals). This breaks the previous record set in 2018, with budget spending at US$261 billion and it might spark concerns about the economy’s sustainability as the increase for 2019 includes a hefty bill for cost-of-living allowances introduced last year.



Last month, the IMF slashed its forecast for Saudi Arabia’s economic growth this year to 1.8 percent, down by 0.6 percentage point from the previous economic outlook in October, due to lower oil prices and lower oil production growth.The IMF sees growth in Saudi Arabia for 2019 at 1.8 percent, compared to 2.4 percent expected last October, while it lifted its 2020 economic growth forecast by 0.2 percentage point from October to 2.1 percent.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Washington Eyes Crackdown On OPECMaduro Asks OPEC For Help As U.S. Sanctions BiteTax Cuts Or Not, Mexico’s Pemex Is Doomed

Jason Kenney, the leader of the United Conservative Party (UCP), expected by polls to win this year’s election in Alberta, has vowed to fight harder for the province’s oil to get more market access and maximize benefits for Alberta’s economy.Kenney is pledging more drastic measures to get oil pipelines finally built, and thus alleviating takeaway capacity bottlenecks that have plagued the richest oil province in Canada after it recovered from the oil price crash.UCP’s leader Kenney told Bloomberg in an interview that if elected, he would cut off oil shipments to provinces that don’t approve of new oil pipelines, kill the carbon tax, boycott banks that stay away from fossil fuel investments, and pressure the federal government to stop transferring money to other provinces if Canada doesn’t get new pipelines to ship Alberta’s oil to either of the coasts.



‘Looking into every new way of moving the oil to ocean ports’ is one of Kenney’s key pledges, including reviving versions or parts of previously proposed and dumped pipeline projects.Related: U.S. Sanctions, OPEC Cuts Create Rare Oil Price ShakeupIncumbent Premier Rachel Notley of NDP has also been fighting for Alberta’s oil to get more access to markets, including by mandating an oil production cut of 325,000 bpd for three months starting January 2019 in a bid to prop up the price of Western Canadian Select (WCS)—the benchmark price of oil from Canada’s oil sands—which had slumped to as low as US$14 a barrel in October and November, with its discount to WTI at around US$50 a barrel.According to Kenny, more has to be done for Alberta’s economy and oil than Notley has done.



Alberta’s elections have surprised pollsters over the past decade. Yet, a January poll from Mainstreet Research showed that Kenney’s UDP leads by a wide margin—nearly 25 percent—over Notley’s NDP. Notley, however, has seen her numbers improved since the November poll, which should give the NDP some hope in the next election, Mainstreet Research said.“The UCP is polling higher than Kenney’s favorability numbers again this month, while Notley is polling above the NDP this month,” said Quito Maggi, President and CEO of Mainstreet Research. “This shows that Notley is clearly an asset to the NDP, while the same can’t be said for Kenney and the UCP.”By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Maduro Asks OPEC For Help As U.S. Sanctions BiteTax Cuts Or Not, Mexico’s Pemex Is DoomedSouth Africa Oil Discovery Could Be A Game-Changer

Oil and gas supermajor BP invested more in Egypt in each of the past two years than in any other country, BP’s chief executive officer Bob Dudley said at an energy forum in Cairo on Monday.“For the last two years in a row we’ve invested more money in Egypt than in any other country. So this is a deep, deep commitment to Egypt,” Reuters quoted Dudley as saying at the event.At the end of last year, Dudley told The National in an interview that BP had spent in the last two years US$6.8 billion in Egypt’s oil and gas, adding that the company had plans to boost investments in projects in other countries in the Middle East, including Oman and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).



In December 2018, BP said that it had agreed to buy from Italy’s Eni a 25-percent participating interest in the Nour North Sinai concession area offshore Egypt.Today, BP announced first gas production from the second stage of its West Nile Delta development offshore Egypt—the second major project for the supermajor this year, following the Gulf of Mexico’s Constellation development, in which BP has a 66.6-percent non-operated stake.The third stage of the West Nile Delta project in Egypt will develop the Raven field, with production expected in late 2019.



Combined full production from all three phases of the West Nile Delta project is expected to reach almost 1.4 billion cubic feet per day (bcf/d), which would be equal to around 20 percent of Egypt’s current gas production. All the gas produced will be fed into the Egyptian national gas grid.“With the second stage of West Nile Delta now online, BP has now safely brought 21 new upstream major projects into production over the last three years, keeping us on track to deliver 900,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day by 2021,” Bob Dudley said in BP’s statement on Monday.

Forces from the Petroleum Facilities Guard sent by the UN-recognized government of Libya have reached the Sharara field, which the Libyan National Army, affiliated with the rival government in Eastern Libya, took control over earlier this month, Reuters reports, citing a Libyan government source.Last month, forces loyal to eastern strongman General Khalifa Haftar and his self-styled Libyan National Army (LNA) said that they had started a military operation to secure oil sites and facilities in Libya’s south, where Sharara is located.



Then last week, a unit of PFG forces loyal to Libya’s UN-backed government in Tripoli was sent south to secure the Sharara oil field. Sharara has the capacity to pump 340,000 bpd, but has been under force majeure since December 9, 2018, after armed militia and tribesmen seized control and demanded ransom to re-open it.Nearly two months later, Sharara remains offline, and Libya’s National Oil Corporation (NOC), which refuses to yield to ransom demands, said in December that, “Oil production will now only restart at Sharara after alternative security arrangements are put in place.”  



On Saturday, the National Oil Corporation called on all involved parties to make sure workers at the field are safe and to protect the production infrastructure. The Libya Herald quoted NOC’s chairman, Mustafa Sanalla, as saying “Worker safety remains our primary concern. We urge all parties to avoid conflict and the politicisation of key infrastructure. Any damage to the field could have serious consequences for the sector, the environment and the national economy.”The LNA, meanwhile, has called for NOC to lift the force majeure from the country’s largest field, but Sanalla has refused to do so, citing the tense situation between the rival factions.  “Obviously, normal operations cannot restart until security is restored,” he told local media.According to the latest Monthly Oil Market Report by OPEC, Libya’s oil production fell to 928,000 bpd in December, from 1.1 million bpd a month earlier on the back of the Sharara disruption and severe weather that closed its oil terminals temporary.

Venezuela’s troubled state oil company PDVSA is telling the buyers of oil produced by its joint ventures to deposit the money for purchases in a new bank account recently opened at Russia’s Gazprombank, Reuters reports citing an internal document and sources in the know.The report follows statements from the opposition—whose leader and President of the National Assembly declared himself interim president last month—that a special fund will be set up in the United States where proceeds from the sale of Venezuelan crude would go.



However, to make matters more interesting, Gazprombank was quick to deny the Reuters report. RT quoted the bank as saying, “No new accounts have been opened,” adding that the Reuters report “does not reflect the actual situation.” Yet the bank also said PDVSA had several accounts in it, although all of them were opened several years ago.PDVSA exploits the vast reserves of oil in the Orinoco Belt via several joint ventures, including companies such as France’s Total, Norwegian Equinor, and even a U.S. supermajor, Chevron. At the moment, Venezuela produces around 1.1 million bpd of crude, which is the lowest in several decades, leading to a slump in exports to a multi-decade low as well. Wood Mackenzie analysts expect this to fall to 900,000 bpd as a result of increased U.S. pressure on Caracas.



Meanwhile, while the Maduro government grapples with an increasingly complex political situation, opposition leader Juan Guaido has declared that he will be appointing new board of directors of PDSVA and its U.S. business, Citgo. The declaration came on the heels on a statement from U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin that all proceeds from sales of Venezuelan crude to U.S. refiners would be withheld unless PDVSA recognized Guaido as the legitimate leader of the country, which the company has not done so far.

South Sudan is looking to pump more than 350,000 bpd of oil by the middle of next year, compared to current production of 140,000 bpd, South Sudan’s Oil Minister Ezekiel Lul Gatkuoth told Reuters on the sidelines of a conference in India.South Sudan broke from Sudan in 2011 and took with it around 350,000 bpd in oil production. After South Sudan’s secession from Sudan, the two countries have been mutually dependent on oil revenues, because the south has 75 percent of the oil reserves, while the north has the only current transport route for the oil to international markets.But then civil war in South Sudan broke out in 2013 that further complicated oil production. The oil price crash the following year additionally affected oil income and oil production in South Sudan.



South Sudan’s government and rebels signed a power-sharing agreement in August 2018, hoping to put an end to the civil war. Oil production at some oil fields that were shut in at the start of the conflict has resumed. At the end of August 2018, South Sudan resumed production from the Toma South oilfield at a rate of 20,000 bpd, adding to South Sudan’s total daily average of 130,000 bpd.By the end of this year, South Sudan expects its oil production to nearly double from the current 140,000 bpd to 270,000 bpd, minister Ezekiel Lul Gatkuoth told Reuters. By the middle of 2020, the country aims to restore production to the pre-civil war levels, he noted.Related: An Overlooked Opportunity In Natural Gas“We used to produce 350,000 to 400,000 bpd. We expect to go back to those levels by the middle of next year,” Gatkuoth told Reuters.



South Sudan has signed a preliminary agreement with Russian oil firm Zarubezhneft to explore some blocks, while South Africa has committed to invest US$1 billion and to collaborate with South Sudan on pipeline construction and a refinery to be built next to the border with Ethiopia, the minister said.South Sudan hopes to significantly boost its production in the near term, but according to energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie, the extent of damage to infrastructure is unknown, as is the performance of wells that have been shut-in since 2013. The biggest challenge to South Sudan’s rising oil production, however, would be whether the peace deal would hold long enough to allow for a sustained increase in oil production, WoodMac said in September 2018.

Tesla Model 3 topped the global EV sales ranking compiled by CleanTechnica and EV Volumes for 2018. In fact, Tesla as a brand dominated the top 5, with all three of its models there. The Nissan Leaf and BAIC EC-Series were also among the top five EVs sold in 2018.In absolute terms, Tesla Model 3 sales topped 140,000, with Chinese BAIC’s EC-Series at about 90,000 vehicles and the Nissan Leaf slightly lower than that. Tesla challengers from BMW, Toyota, Renault, and Mitsubishi were far down the list.



The ranking suggests that the Model 3 may indeed turn out to be the car that will tip Tesla’s fortunes into positive territory, after a string of mass production delays and an even longer string of quarterly losses reported by Tesla made many doubt whether the company had long to live.Yet the most shorted company in the history of the U.S. market somehow managed to turn things around and ramp up the Model 3 production quickly enough to report a profit for the third quarter of 2018. The company remained in the black in the next quarter as well, although it is not completely out of the woods as it also announced job cuts of 7 percents in order to make its cars more cost-competitive.



The ranking results are good news for the global EV market as a whole, however, even though they might worry Europe’s big carmakers who have ambitious plans to take on Tesla with extensive new EV lineups. Total EV sales last year brought the share of plug-in cars to 2.1 percent, which, albeit not a very impressive figure on its own, is a lot more than EVs accounted for just two years ago.This year Tesla plans to add another model to its lineup, the Tesla Semi, which the head of Daimler’s truck business notoriously mocked as going against the laws of physics. However, the truck may already be in the testing stage, according to an Electrek report from January citing a logistics company Tesla had approached with a proposal to test drive the Semi that was showcased last year.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Maduro Asks OPEC For Help As U.S. Sanctions BiteSouth Africa Oil Discovery Could Be A Game-ChangerAn Overlooked Opportunity In Natural Gas

Yemen’s Saudi-backed government has plans to export crude oil at a rate of 75,000 bpd this year, according to oil minister Aws Abdullah al-Awd, who spoke to Reuters.“We will maintain production from four blocks and are planning to build a pipeline to Arab Sea (Arabian Sea) to resume exports from these blocks,” Al-Awd said. The plans also involve raising crude oil production to 110,000 bpd this year. The Saudi-backed government controls Yemen’s oil and gas fields, while the Houthi rebels supported by Iran holds the country’s capital, Sanaa, and an oil terminal on Yemen’s west coast.



The war-torn country that is also suffering a dizzying humanitarian crisis in recent world history as a result of the war between the Houthis and the Saudi-led regional coalition last year produced only 50,000 bpd of crude oil even though its reserves stand at around 2 billion barrels, according to data from the Energy Information Administration.Related: Oil Rig Count Rises As Oil Prices StabilizeExports last year were meager, restarting only in August with a 500,000-barrel cargo from a field in the southern Shabwa province bound for a Chinese company. This was the first outbound shipment of crude oil from Yemen since 2015 when the civil war broke out and quickly escalated into an international conflict. It was offered in an open tender, in which 35 companies from around the world took part, the Yemeni ministry of oil and minerals said in a statement. Before the war, however, Yemen produced around 127,000 bpd, as of 2014.



Crude oil production and exports are not the only items on the government’s energy agenda. According to Al-Awd, Yemen will also boost its liquefied natural gas production this year. The target is 6.7 million tons of the fuel, with half of that to be bound for exports. A year later, the minister said, “We hope to export all of our LNG production, mainly to customers in Asia.”The Yemen LNG project, worth US$4.5 billion, began operating in 2005 with a capacity of 6.7 million tons of gas annually. The project draws the gas from the Marib field, which has proven reserves of 9.15 trillion cu ft of natural gas.

A very large partially loaded oil tanker from Saudi Arabia is heading to Venezuela in an extremely rare shipment between the two oil producers and OPEC members, S&P Global Platts trade flow data showed on Friday.The very large crude carrier (VLCC)—one capable of carrying up to 2 million barrels of crude oil, refined oil products, or condensate—is owned by Saudi tanker company Bahri. The super tanker, Abqaiq, left the Yanbu port on the Red Sea on January 20 and is scheduled to arrive at Venezuela’s main crude oil terminal of Jose on February 11, according to Platts tanker flow data.This is a very unusual voyage for a Saudi oil tanker as no tanker owned by Saudi Arabia has been spotted to have made the trip to Venezuela in at least the past two years, Platts data show. Other Bahri-owned tankers currently in the Atlantic Ocean have their final destinations set for the U.S. Gulf Coast, which is the conventional destination of Saudi tankers sailing in the Atlantic.



Shipping sources tell Platts that the tankers owned by Bahri are being exclusively used by Saudi state oil giant Saudi Aramco to ship crude oil or refined oil products.The ship is partly loaded, so there could be two possible explanations, according to Platts—one is that the tanker is shipping Saudi light oil or condensate to Venezuela, the other is that it could load Venezuelan crude oil to later ship it to another region.The light oil/condensate delivery scenario could be a plausible one, because with the new U.S. sanctions on Venezuela’s oil industry and its state oil firm PDVSA, Venezuela can’t import naphtha from the U.S. to use it as a diluent to blend with its extra heavy crude oil to make it flow for exports.



Yet another possible explanation for the very rare trip could be that the tanker crew may have incorrectly entered the destination, according to Platts.By Tsevtana Paraskova for Oilprice.com More Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Tesla Disputes Study That Icy Weather Leads To 41% Drop In EVs RangeHow Washington Could Spoil The OPEC+ AllianceThe Natural Gas Price Plunge Isn’t Over Yet

Amid growing uncertainties on the global oil market, Japan is looking to boost its energy cooperation with Russia, and international sanctions on Moscow don’t prohibit cooperation, Japan’s Economy, Trade and Industry Minister Hiroshige Seko said in a written interview with S&P Global Platts published on Friday.Japan, which relies almost exclusively on imports of crude oil and liquefied natural gas (LNG) to meet its demand for those products, sees the benefit of shorter travel times and safer routes for deliveries from Russia’s Far East, amid increased uncertainties in the global oil market with the U.S. sanctions on Iran, according to Seko.“Imports of Russian crude oil and LNG do not go through any chokepoints such as the Strait of Hormuz. Therefore they are important for the diversification of Japan's energy import sources, and I hope that Russia will play an even larger role. I would like to continue working to expand our cooperation,” Seko told Platts.



Currently, Japan relies heavily on imports from the Middle East, with cargoes having to pass through the Strait of Hormuz, which Iran has threatened to block numerous times over the past few years.Japanese companies are also interested in taking part in planned LNG projects in Russia, including Arctic LNG 2, Baltic LNG, and the third train at Sakhalin, the Japanese minister said, noting that if Japanese firms secure participation, Japan could boost its LNG imports from Russia in the future.Sanctions on Russia are not a concern for Japan, because Tokyo complies with them, yet sanctions “do not comprehensively prohibit Japan’s energy cooperation with Russia,” Seko told Platts.



Japanese and Russian firms have recently entered into an early agreement for possible future cooperation in LNG.As Russia’s LNG producer Novatek is looking to boost LNG supply to the growing Asian market, the Russian firm has recently signed a preliminary agreement with Japan’s Saibu Gas, under which the companies will consider potential cooperation in entering the end-consumer LNG market in Asia. Novatek will optimize its LNG supplies to the Asia-Pacific region by using Saibu Gas’s Hibiki LNG terminal in Japan, the Russian firm said in December.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:The ‘Shocking Details’ Of The Green New DealAlberta Oil Cuts To End Sooner Than PlannedHow Washington Could Spoil The OPEC+ Alliance

Kazakhstan has postponed the listing of its state oil and gas firm KazMunayGas (KMG) until after 2019, due to worsening market conditions and Brexit uncertainty that could dampen investor appetite on London’s stock exchange, Reuters reported on Friday, citing two banking sources.Kazakhstan’s wealth fund Samruk-Kazyna holds 90 percent in KMG, while the central bank, the National Bank of the Republic of Kazakhstan, owns 10 percent plus 1 share. KazMunayGas produces 28 percent of Kazakhstan’s total crude oil and gas condensate production and 16 percent of the country’s natural and associated gas.



Kazakhstan’s fund Samruk-Kazyna originally had plans for an initial public offering (IPO) of KazMunayGas at some point after 2018, as part of a government privatization program.Now the listing has been further pushed out to beyond 2019, due to a stalling IPO market on the London Stock Exchange, concerns over the global economy, the U.S.-China trade war, and the uncertainty over Brexit, Reuters reports.



According to Reuters’ sources, work on the listing of KMG has stalled because of the worsening market conditions.In October 2018, people with knowledge of Kazakhstan’s plans told the Financial Times that KMG was finalizing plans for its IPO that could raise up to US$6.5 billion, which would have made it the biggest listing for a central Asian company ever. In the fall of last year, bankers were pitching for roles in the IPO which was planned to take place on the London Stock Exchange and on a local market in Kazakhstan, Astana or Almaty, FT’s sources said, but noted that work had been progressing slowly and a listing could be expected in late 2019.The plans until a few months ago were to list between 20 percent and 25 percent of KMG in an IPO expected to value the entire company at between US$25 billion and US$26 billion, the FT reported at the end of October 2018.

Not only ordinary Venezuelan people have been fleeing poverty and hyperinflation in the Latin American country in recent years.Oil workers are also leaving their poor-paying jobs in the country holding the world’s largest oil reserves for a better life and oil jobs in other oil-rich countries, leaving fewer and fewer skilled workers who could help reverse Venezuela’s collapsing crude oil production, even if Nicolas Maduro is ousted and a business and private-investment friendly leadership takes over, Associated Press correspondent Scott Smith writes.Venezuelan oil workers have been leaving the country since 2003, with the first wave of fleeing workers under previous president Hugo Chavez. Many of those have found jobs and a new life in other countries hungry for skilled oil workers, including Kuwait, Angola, Canada, and Iraq’s semi-autonomous region of Kurdistan.



Tomas Paez, a professor at Central University of Venezuela, told AP’s Smith that Venezuela’s oil workers are employed in the oil industries in 90 countries worldwide. The initial wave of emigration began in 2003, when an estimated 30,000 Venezuelan oil workers fled, after Hugo Chavez publicly fired thousands of them for staging a strike.Thousands more have fled since then, leaving fewer and fewer skilled workers that could help turn around the ailing oil industry.Those who are still working in Venezuela’s oil sector work in dangerous conditions without safety precautions and many of them often report hungry for work.



More than 3 million Venezuelan people have fled the country amid an aggravating humanitarian crisis and an extreme poverty rate of 40 percent.The economic collapse adds to years of mismanagement and underinvestment in the oil industry to further complicate attempts in Venezuela, one of OPEC’s five founding members, to stop the steep decline of its oil production.OPEC figures show that Venezuela’s crude oil production dropped by another 33,000 bpd from November to just 1.148 million bpd in December, compared to average 1.911 million for 2017. As of this month, Venezuela’s production could accelerate the plunge because under the new U.S. sanctions, Venezuela will not be able to import U.S. naphtha to dilute its heavy crude grades.

A committee from the House of Representatives has approved a bill aimed at making OPEC members liable to U.S. antitrust legislation, Reuters reports, adding the prospects of the bill ending up as law were not certain yet.The No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels Act, or NOPEC, as it’s more widely known, would, if passed into law, allow the U.S. attorney general to sue separate members of OPEC or the whole group for collusion. At the moment, OPEC members separately and together are protected by sovereign immunity.



This is not the first bill aimed at making it possible to target OPEC with anti-cartel measures. In fact, Reuters recalls, bills of this kind have been considered in the House of Representatives on multiple occasions during the past two decades. However, none of them has ever reached full House vote and it remains unclear whether this one will.Chances are it won’t, in light of Washington’s close ties with Riyadh, the de factor leader of OPEC. The relationship is equally important for Saudi Arabia, but the threat of lawsuits for collusion will likely lead to a quick reaction.



President Trump, according to Reuters, has in the past, before taking the presidency, spoken in support of such a law. Since his entry into office, however, he has not spoken in favor of a NOPEC bill, instead making a point to note the importance of Saudi Arabia for the United States, chiefly because of the huge arm sales deals that Riyadh offers Washington.Political considerations aide, the chances of the bill becoming a law are also reduced by low oil prices and lack of support from the industry. International oil companies have warned of retaliatory measures from OPEC, and the American Petroleum Institute has also spoken against such a bill, saying that rising U.S. crude oil production is already diminishing OPEC’s global market influence.

Venezuela’s PDVSA has begun mixing its extra heavy crude with locally produced light oil as imported diluents from the United States are now hard to come by, Reuters reports, citing local sources.Normally, PDVSA mixes the heavy crude with U.S. naphtha, which is perhaps the most common heavy crude diluent to make it transportable by pipeline or loadable on tankers, at a rate of 100,000 bpd of naphtha to 400,000 bpd of heavy crude from the Orinoco Belt. However, the latest sanctions that Washington slapped on Caracas include a ban for U.S. refiners to export diluents to the South American country.



PDVSA exploits the vast reserves of oil in the Orinoco Belt via several joint ventures, including companies such as France’s Total, Norwegian Equinor, and even a U.S. supermajor, Chevron. Normally, according to Reuters, the joint venture partners would market their production separately, but now, the unnamed source says, the mixed crude is being delivered to PDVSA for exports as a way around U.S. sanctions.Earlier this month, amid the fast-deteriorating political situation in Venezuela, a Wood Mac analyst warned that the country’s production could fall below 1 million barrels daily.



“We believe production will likely fall to around 900,000 b/d under pressure from sanctions and a lack of materials for workovers, but we expect waivers will ease the full impact of the sanctions until they expire,” Anne-Louise Hittle said.Wood Mackenzie analysts believe the situation will require certain flexibility from local oilfield services providers as foreign companies exit the country. If they can maintain current production, the problem could partly be solved. However, it’s anyone’s guess what the level of expertise at these local companies is, not to mention their financial and equipment resources.At the moment, Venezuela produces around 1.1 million bpd of crude, which is the lowest in several decades, leading to a slump in exports to a multi-decade low as well.  By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Oil And Gas In Spotlight At State Of The UnionChina Faces An Uphill Battle For Energy IndependenceBusinesses Bought Record Amount Of Renewable Energy In 2018

The U.S. sanctions on Venezuela’s oil industry and state oil firm PDVSA are unlikely to have a significant impact on the refinery runs of the U.S. refiners, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) said in an analysis this week.U.S. imports of crude oil from Venezuela have been falling in recent years, and U.S. refiners have been replacing heavy crude from Venezuela from heavy crude grades from other sources, the EIA said.Last week, the U.S. imposed sanctions on PDVSA to “help prevent further diverting of Venezuela’s assets by Maduro and preserve these assets for the people of Venezuela,” Secretary of the Treasury Steven T. Mnuchin said.



Those sanctions will essentially eliminate U.S. imports of Venezuelan crude oil as the full effects of the sanctions emerge, the EIA said, but noted that it doesn’t expect “any significant decrease in U.S. refinery runs as a result of these sanctions.”Imports of crude oil from Venezuela are still a significant portion of the U.S. Gulf Coast imports, but they have been falling in recent years due to the collapsing Venezuelan oil production. Gulf Coast imports of Venezuelan crude oil fell to an average of 498,000 bpd between January and November 2018 from an average of 618,000 bpd in the first 11 months of 2017, the EIA said.Out of the 14 U.S. refineries that imported crude from Venezuela last year—12 of which in the Gulf Coast—imports in January-November declined by 129,000 bpd compared with the same period in 2017. While imports from Venezuela declined, imports from Canada and Mexico to these refineries rose by 113,000 bpd and 48,000 bpd, respectively, from 2017 levels, the EIA has estimated.



“Moving forward, refineries may also choose to run lighter crude oils because transportation constraints may limit the availability of heavy crude oils,” according to the EIA.Refiners with large capacity to process asphalt and road oils, for which Venezuela’s heavy crude is well-suited, may find it harder to procure adequate replacement, but these refiners have also cut imports from Venezuela recently, the EIA noted.    By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:How Washington Could Spoil The OPEC+ AllianceThe Natural Gas Price Plunge Isn’t Over YetOil And Gas In Spotlight At State Of The Union

A part of TransCanada’s Keystone oil pipeline, the crucial route carrying crude oil from Canada’s Alberta province to U.S. refineries, has been shut down for investigation of a possible leak near St. Louis in Missouri, a TransCanada spokesman told Reuters on Thursday.TransCanada shut down the portion of the 590,000-bpd Keystone pipeline between Steele City, Nebraska and Patoka, Illinois, the company’s spokesman Terry Cunha told Reuters in an email.TransCanada has sent crews to the site to investigate what’s happening and assess the situation, Cunha said, noting that a portion of the pipeline remained shut on Thursday.



The Missouri Department of Natural Resources plans to find the leak today and the release of oil has stopped, an official with the department told Reuters yesterday.The shutdown of part of Keystone comes at a time in which Canadian heavy crude is becoming increasingly in demand as refiners look to replace the heavy crude grades from Venezuela after the U.S. slapped sweeping sanctions on the Latin American country’s oil industry and its state oil firm PDVSA.Yet, the pipeline routes for Canadian oil to the U.S. are full to capacity and rising production in Canada last year led to further takeaway capacity constraints that forced Alberta to mandate an oil production cut of 325,000 bpd for three months starting January 2019. Last week, the Alberta province said it was easing the production cuts in February and March to 3.63 million bpd, which is a 75,000-bpd increase from the January limit of 3.56 million bpd, after seeing that the excessive oil storage has started to clear out.



According to data from Net Energy Exchange quoted by Reuters, the discount of Western Canadian Select (WCS)—the benchmark price of oil from Canada’s oil sands—to WTI widened on Thursday morning to US$10.15 a barrel from US$9.40 a barrel earlier.In November 2017, TransCanada shut Keystone down for nearly two weeks after the pipeline leaked 5,000 barrels of crude oil in South Dakota.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Russia Begins To Fear Maduro May LoseTrump Under Fire For Support Of Saudi-Led Coalition In YemenCan Anything Slow Down U.S. LNG?

Iran’s oil customers should not expect new U.S. waivers in May, the U.S. Special Representative for Iran, Brian Hook, said this week, urging buyers to stop importing Iranian oil.“What we have announced is the policy to get to zero imports of Iranian crude as quickly as possible. We are not looking to grant any future waivers or exceptions to our sanctions regime, whether it is oil or anything else,” Hook told Japanese public broadcaster NHK while on a visit to Japan.When it re-imposed sanctions on Iran last November, the U.S. granted waivers to eight countries so they could continue purchasing oil from Iran at reduced rates until early May 2019. 



Some of those buyers, including the four major Asian buyers of Iranian oil—China, India, Japan, and South Korea—have recently resumed buying limited volumes of Iranian crude oil, after a period of around a month and a half in which they had to clarify how much and under what conditions they would purchase oil from Iran.Earlier this week, Iran criticized Italy and Greece for not buying Iranian oil despite the fact that they had obtained waivers to do so.The U.S. Administration has not officially said that no waivers will be issued, but officials have said that the goal is to drive Iranian exports to zero. Analysts, however, believe that there will be a direct correlation between the U.S. Iran waivers policy and the price of oil at the time Washington decides.



Despite the fact that the U.S. is not looking to grant any waivers to Iranian oil customers when the current ones expire in early May, it shouldn’t be taken for granted that no waivers will be issued, Hook and analysts hinted last month. “We did not want to lift the price of oil, and we were successful doing that. So when the president left the deal it was trading at $74. When our sanctions went back into effect, and we had taken off a million barrels of Iranian crude, oil was at $72,” Hook said at Atlantic Council’s 2019 Global Energy Forum in Abu Dhabi in mid-January. By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Russia Begins To Fear Maduro May LoseAlberta Oil Cuts To End Sooner Than PlannedUncertainty Continues For LNG Markets

Refinery runs at Marathon Petroleum (NYSE:MPC) jumped by 56 percent in the fourth quarter of 2018 from the same period of 2017, driven by the combination with Andeavor and the huge discount of Canadian oil to WTI, the largest U.S. independent refiner said on Thursday.Marathon Petroleum’s total refinery utilization stood at 94 percent in Q4 2018, with total throughputs of 3.1 million barrels per day, compared to 2.0 million bpd in Q4 2017, the company said in its 2018 results release.“The increase in quarter-over-quarter segment results was primarily due to higher throughputs as a result of the Andeavor combination as well as wider WCS- and WTI-based crude differentials,” Marathon Petroleum said.



Income from operations in the refining and marketing segment jumped to US$923 million in Q4 2018 from US$732 million in Q4 2017, driven by high utilization and wide crude differentials. The refining and marketing (R&M) margin per barrel also jumped in Q4 2018—to US$15.07 from US$13.12 in Q4 2017.  Marathon Petroleum’s margins at the end of last year were also boosted by the ultra-cheap Canadian crude processed at its Midwest refineries.As Canadian oil production was growing last year, takeaway capacity constraints and maintenance at U.S. refineries in the fall of 2018 drove down the price of Western Canadian Select (WCS)—the benchmark price of oil from Canada’s oil sands—to as low as US$14 a barrel in October and November, with its discount to WTI at around US$50 a barrel.



In early December, the Alberta government moved in to shore up the price of Canadian heavy oil and in the most drastic measure yet, the province of Alberta mandated an oil production cut of 325,000 bpd for three months starting January 2019.  Canada’s heavy oil price has recovered since the oil production cut began, with the discount to WTI narrowing to its lowest in a decade at the beginning of January.Last week, the Alberta province said it was easing the production cuts in February and March to 3.63 million bpd, which is a 75,000-bpd increase from the January limit of 3.56 million bpd, after analyzing data that suggested oil storage levels had been decreasing roughly one million barrels per week since the start of 2019 and are on track to continue clearing the storage glut.“We will adjust these production levels as necessary going forward and we will not waver in our fight for a Made-in-Alberta strategy to build new pipelines, access new markets and add value that creates jobs by upgrading more of our oil and gas here at home,” Alberta Premier Rachel Notley said last week.   By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Venezuelan Oil Exports Plunge On ‘Harsher’ SanctionsBig Oil Defies 40% Price Plunge, Posts Best Results In YearsChina Faces An Uphill Battle For Energy Independence

France’s oil and gas major Total has pulled out all its personnel from Venezuela following the U.S. sanctions on Venezuelan state oil firm PDVSA, which also blocked Total’s accounts in the Latin American country, CEO Patrick Pouyanné said on Thursday.Total’s accounts have been blocked due to U.S. decisions, AFP quoted Pouyanné as saying at the presentation of the group’s 2018 financials.“The other practical problem is that, given the sanctions, we should no longer manage Venezuela from the United States... but from Europe,” the manager said, noting that Total of course will be complying with the U.S. sanctions and has put its Venezuelan operations in a “hibernation mode.”



As of 2017, Total had around 50 employees in Venezuela, according to the group’s website. The French group first began exploration in Venezuela back in 1980, and has been active in the exploration and production of extra-heavy crude oil and natural gas in the Latin American country.However, after the U.S. imposed sweeping sanctions on PDVSA at the beginning of last week, Total has frozen operations.“We decided to evacuate all of our personnel from Venezuela given what has happened... since last Monday,” AFP quoted Pouyanné as saying on Thursday.Related: BP Beats Estimates, Posts Highest Profit In Five Years



Venezuelan operations are not crucial for Total and they won’t have a significant impact on the supermajor’s production, given the fact that Venezuela accounts for just 50,000 bpd of Total’s 3 million bpd production, according to Pouyanné.Earlier on Thursday, Total said that its 2018 oil and gas production hit a record high, growing by more than 8 percent from 2017 to reach 2.8 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd), thanks to the start-ups of Ichthys LNG in Australia, Yamal LNG in Russia, and deepwater projects Kaombo North in Angola and Egina in Nigeria. Total expects its production to grow by more than 9 percent in 2019, thanks to the ramp-ups of Kaombo North, Egina, and Ichthys, as well as the start-ups of Iara 1 in Brazil, Kaombo South in Angola, Culzean in the UK, and Johan Sverdrup in Norway.Thanks to higher oil prices, Total’s adjusted net income jumped by 28 percent to US$13.6 billion in 2018.

A gas line operated by Pacific Gas and Electric Co. exploded yesterday, sending flames high into the air, the San Francisco Chronicle reported, adding that the explosion set five buildings around the line on fire.The explosion, it turned out, had occurred by accident, when a member of a Verizon crew working on the same street struck the gas line.It took the company two hours to put it out, the daily reports, because, as explained by a PG & E’s spokesman, the crew had to cut the asphalt to get to the line and turn off a valve to stop the flow by hand, with shovels. The reason they could not use machinery was that the line was too close to the surface and the risk of an accidental spark igniting another blast would have been too great.



“You can imagine having to hand-dig in asphalt. It takes time,” company spokesman Blair Jones said. “It’s also very cold right now. If we do this wrong, we shut off gas to potentially hundreds, maybe thousands more people in San Francisco, so we’re trying to do this in a way that is safe.”As a result of the blast 2,500 residents in the surrounding area were left without electricity and 300 gas customers were cut off. Within a few hours however, electricity supply was restored to most of the affected households.Related: Oil And Gas In Spotlight At State Of The UnionAn investigation by the company is underway now. The Chronicle notes that the utility is required by law to mark its underground lines upon request from another company planning to do excavation work in areas that contain these lines. In this case, the PG & E spokesman confirmed the Verizon contractor whose team struck the line had sent a request for line marking but did not say whether the utility had done the marking.



PG&E has been previously accused by state regulators of falsifying its line marking reports: a practice that has gone on for years, according to an earlier report by the San Francisco Chronicle. Workers, according to an investigation, falsified the speed with which they responded to requests for line markings. The law says responses have to be made within two days of the request.PG&E filed for voluntary Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last week after facing liabilities for wildfires it was accused of having a hand in starting in Northern California in 2017 and 2018.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Extreme Volatility In U.S. Natural Gas To End SoonBank Of America: Oil Demand Growth To Hit Zero Within A DecadeHedge Funds Drop Shorts On Crude Oil

B.C. Hydro has accumulated a US$4.2-billion (C$5.5 billion) pile of so-called deferral accounts as a result of political pressure from provincial governments to keep rates lower than they need to be so the company could cover its operating expenses, the Globe and Mail reports citing Auditor-General Carol Bellringer.“BC Hydro was not allowed to charge its customers enough to cover its operating costs each year,” the official said. As a consequence, now every household customer of the utility represents some US$980 (C$1,300) of the total debt, with commercial and light industrial customers representing another US$7,500 (C$10,000), and large industrial customers representing some US$3.77 million (C$5 million) each.



The current NDP government has promised to fix the problem. According to the acting minister in charge of the utility, Bruce Ralson, the government has already managed to reduce the deferred accounts burden by over US$700 million (C$950 million) by moving the sum directly onto government accounts.“It would be wrong to promise overnight change, but we have changed direction,” Ralson told the Globe and Mail. The official added ""We are going to keep rates affordable. No one’s rates are going up by $1,300 in a year.”



It was this ambition to keep rates affordable that led a number of past governments to resort to deferral accounts for decades in a bid to avoid price hikes that could create disgruntlement among the electorate.The current government, however, has said it will restore the British Columbia Utility Commission, the local industry regulator, to its lead role and will make sure B.C. Hydro follows the example of other utilities across the country and resumes using ordinary accounting practices that do not include deferral accounts.The Auditor-General, however, is skeptical. “The ability of BCUC to regulate BC Hydro and its regulatory accounts remains hampered by government direction,” Bellringer said, adding that she would prefer to see some results first to believe the good intentions are leading to something material.

The U.S. plan to withdraw its troops from Syria will not give Islamic State an opportunity to try to retake some oil fields in the war-torn country, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told FOX Business on Wednesday.“I am confident we will make sure that ISIS doesn’t have access to those oil fields,” Secretary Pompeo told FOX Business’ Maria Bartiromo in a conversation about the Trump Administration’s plans for withdrawal of the U.S. troops from Syria and the consequences for the U.S. allies and for enemies in the region.



The U.S. Administration is determined to quash the Islamic State caliphate and not to allow it to retake oil fields, whose oil it could sell to fund its operations, according to Secretary Pompeo.In September 2017, U.S.-backed Syrian forces seized the Conoco gas plant from Islamic State in the oil-rich Deir Ezzor area, depriving the militants from an important revenue source.



In August 2018, the second-largest oil field in Syria, the Tanak field in the Deir Ezzor region, resumed operations, nearly a year after U.S.-backed predominantly Kurdish forces recaptured the field from ISIS.The Tanak field, which hosts around 150 wells and the capacity to produce up to 40,000 bpd, was captured from the Islamist militants by the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) in November of 2017, following fierce clashes with Islamic State militants on the eastern bank of the Euphrates river in Syria’s Deir Ezzor governorate, which is the country’s richest oil province.Less than a month before recapturing the Tanak oil field, SDF had wrested control over the al-Omar oil field in eastern Syria from the Islamic State. Al-Omar is Syria’s largest oil field, producing around 30,000 bpd before the civil war. After 2011, however, Al-Omar had fallen into the hands of Islamic State, which was at one point making US$5.1 million in monthly oil sale revenues on the black market.

Russia’s gas giant Gazprom aims to further increase its 35-percent market share in Europe, amid higher natural gas demand and expected lower production at key western European natural gas producers, according to a senior Gazprom manager.The Russian company sees opportunities to lift its market share in Europe even more amid an expected decline in production in the North Sea and the planned shutdown of a huge gas field in the Netherlands, Reuters quoted Elena Burmistrova, Director General of Gazprom Export, as saying at a recent industry event.After years of debates and measures to curb production at the Groningen gas field, the Dutch government decided in March last year that output at Groningen would be terminated by 2030, with a reduction by two-thirds until 2021-2022 and another cut after that. The authorities have already limited production from the field because of the earthquakes it causes, but they decided last year that the risks and costs were no longer acceptable.



Gazprom’s preliminary estimates show that the company’s share on the European market was 34 percent in 2017, while the share in 2018 could have hit 35 percent, Burmistrova said in remarks published by Reuters on Wednesday.With North Sea production gradually falling, “the space for Russian gas is being freed up,” the manager said.Gazprom is not setting targets for its market share in Europe as it doesn’t want to sound too “aggressive,” according to Burmistrova.



Several European countries, including the Baltic states and Poland, as well as the European Union (EU), have expressed concern about Russia using gas sales and its gas monopoly Gazprom as a political tool.Burmistrova’s take is that Gazprom has proven it is a reliable natural gas supplier and it “will always be competitive against American LNG,” to which counties like Poland and Lithuania look for reducing their dependence on Russian supplies.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Mozambique LNG Increasingly Appealing For International PlayersPlatts Survey: OPEC Production Drops To Lowest Since March 2015Hedge Funds Drop Shorts On Crude Oil

UK company Cuadrilla said on Wednesday that initial flow tests at its fracking site in northwest England showed a rich reservoir with high-quality recoverable natural gas, while it also called for the rules on tremor limits to be eased so proper appraisals could be made.Cuadrilla started fracking at an exploration site in Lancashire in October 2018, resuming hydraulic fracturing in the UK for the first time in seven years. Natural gas started to flow to the surface from Cuadrilla’s shale exploration well at the Preston New Road site in early November. The company, however, has had to stop operations multiple times, due to micro seismic events measuring above the threshold requiring a halt.According to UK regulations, in case of micro seismic events of 0.50 on the Richter scale or higher, fracking must temporarily be halted and pressure in the well reduced.



In today’s announcement, Cuadrilla said that “An intentionally conservative micro-seismic operating limit during hydraulic fracturing, set at just 0.5 on the Richter Scale, had however severely constrained the volume of sand that could be injected into the shale rock.”The company confirmed that it had asked the Oil and Gas Authority (OGA) of the UK to urgently review the so-called traffic light system (TLS) for measuring seismic events, in order to enable proper and safe testing, exploration, and production at the Preston New Road site.Related: Hedge Funds Drop Shorts On Crude Oil“Subject to the outcome of such a review Cuadrilla plans to complete hydraulic fracturing of the PNR1 well, fracture the PNR2 well and carry out flow testing of both wells later this year,” the company said.



Earlier this week, oil, gas, and chemicals group Ineos called on the UK government to either lift the seismicity limit on fracking from a currently “unworkable” and too-low ceiling, or end shale altogether without using political backdoors to shut it down.Cuadrilla remains committed to the opportunity, CEO Francis Egan said in today’s statement, adding “All we ask now is that we are treated fairly, with comparable seismic and ground vibration levels to similar industries in Lancashire and elsewhere in the UK who are able to work safely but more effectively with significantly higher thresholds for seismicity and ground vibration.”By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Oil Heads Lower On Small Inventory BuildChina Faces An Uphill Battle For Energy IndependenceMozambique LNG Increasingly Appealing For International Players

A unit of forces loyal to Libya’s UN-backed government in Tripoli has been sent south to secure the country’s largest oil field, Sharara, which has been shut in for nearly two months after it was occupied by an armed group, in what could turn out to be another clash for a major oil asset in Libya between forces loyal to the government in the west and those pledging allegiance to a strongman in the east.A unit of the Petroleum Facilities Guard (PFG) of the Libyan government of national accord, supported by the United Nations, is heading to Sharara, which has the capacity to pump 340,000 bpd, but which has been under force majeure since December 9, 2018, Qatar-based Al Jazeera TV reported on Wednesday.Sharara has been under force majeure after armed militia claiming attachment to the local PFG seized control and demanded ransom to re-open it.



Nearly two months later, Sharara remains offline, and Libya’s National Oil Corporation (NOC), which refuses to yield to ransom demands, said in December that “Oil production will now only restart at Sharara after alternative security arrangements are put in place.”  Last month, forces loyal to eastern strongman General Khalifa Haftar and his self-styled Libyan National Army (LNA) said that they had started a military operation to secure oil sites and facilities in Libya’s south, where Sharara is located.  LNA has already seized the main city in the southwest, Sebha, and a spokesman for LNA, Ahmed al-Mismari, has told Bloomberg that after seizing the city, the forces would move on to Sharara and other oil facilities in the area. Related: Platts Survey: OPEC Production Drops To Lowest Since March 2015



At a speech in London last week, NOC’s chairman Mustafa Sanalla said that “With some reluctance we have concluded that the preferred solution is a professional PFG force managed by NOC.”“A mixed force might provide a solution within a negotiated security framework. With a robust security framework in place, managed by NOC, Libya will be a much more reliable supplier to the global market and a much more attractive destination for oil and gas investment,” Sanalla said.Yet, according to Bloomberg, the rival forces haven’t shown they are willing to cooperate to keep the Sharara oil field safely operating.

OPEC is seeking closer and more formal ties with Russia in its oil market control endeavors, the Wall Street Journal reports, citing sources from the cartel, adding that Saudi Arabia is spearheading the effort.The move is a logical consequence of more than two years of close cooperation between OPEC and Moscow aimed at supporting prices initially, but later transforming into a wider market-control drive aimed at curbing at least some of the rising clout of the United States as one of the top three global oil producers.



To date, according to the latest production data, the United States is already the biggest crude oil producer, which means it has increased influence on international markets and, of course, prices. In this situation, it makes sense for the third-largest producer, Saudi Arabia, to team up with number-two, to counter this rising influence of the United States.Russia is not too fond of the idea, however. Back in December, Energy Minister Alexander Novak said, “There is a consensus that there will be no such organization. That’s because it requires additional bureaucratic brouhaha.”



However, it’s hardly just the brouhaha that stands in the way of a formal OPEC-Russia marriage. Another reason is that Russia is better positioned to survive and even thrive at lower oil prices than most of OPEC, since it is a lot less dependent on its oil revenues than Saudi Arabia or Kuwait, to mention but a couple. Yet another is the likelihood of opposition from Iran, a close geopolitical ally of Russia, but the archenemy of Saudi Arabia in the Middle East.Other OPEC members would also be hard pressed to accept such a formalization, however slim the chance of it happening. The reason for them is that it would give Saudi Arabia and Russia effectively all the decision-making power for the whole organization.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Oil Markets React Lukewarm To Venezuela Supply OutageHedge Funds Drop Shorts On Crude OilIran Puts ‘Recoverable Reserves’ At 160 Billion Barrels

Venezuela’s state oil firm PDVSA is looking to sell more of its oil to customers in Europe and Asia as the U.S. sanctions are cutting off U.S. buyers of its crude, a senior Venezuelan oil official loyal to Nicolas Maduro told Russian news outlet Sputnik in an interview published on Wednesday.“Yes, we are facing new illegal sanctions from the US. We were exporting about 500,000 bpd to the US. PDVSA will redirect exports to other customers in Europe and Asia,” Ronny Romero, a technical adviser to PDVSA and to Venezuela’s Petroleum Ministry, as well as Venezuela’s National Representative at OPEC, told the news outlet of Russia, which supports Maduro in the Venezuelan political standoff.U.S. sanctions currently apply to U.S. entities, and “anyway, Russia and China don’t care about US sanctions,” Romero told Sputnik, when asked how PDVSA would convince more European and Asian countries to buy its oil.



Last week, the U.S. imposed sanctions on PDVSA to “help prevent further diverting of Venezuela’s assets by Maduro and preserve these assets for the people of Venezuela. The path to sanctions relief for PdVSA is through the expeditious transfer of control to the Interim President or a subsequent, democratically elected government,” Secretary of the Treasury Steven T. Mnuchin said.The sanctions block all payments to PDVSA accounts, and buyers of Venezuelan crude are directed to deposit payments in a separate account, to which PDVSA doesn’t have access.Related: BP Beats Estimates, Posts Highest Profit In Five YearsThe sanctions have created uncertainty over payments for crude cargoes contracted before the sanctions were imposed. Reports have it that tankers carrying as much as 7 million barrels of Venezuelan heavy crude are sitting in the Gulf of Mexico awaiting clarity.



Meanwhile, Juan Guaidó, the Venezuelan opposition leader recognized as the country’s interim president by the U.S. and several major European countries, has ordered Venezuela’s congress to appoint new boards at PDVSA and its U.S. refining unit Citgo, Reuters reports.Guaidó also plans to drop the requirement that PDVSA hold a majority stake in all joint projects, as the leader looks to boost oil production as soon as possible, Guaidó’s envoy to the U.S., Carlos Vecchio, said earlier this week.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Oil Heads Lower On Small Inventory BuildBank Of America: Oil Demand Growth To Hit Zero Within A DecadeChina Faces An Uphill Battle For Energy Independence

Qatar and Exxon have officially announced a US$10-billion joint investment in their Golden Pass LNG project in Texas, which will turn the LNG import terminal into an export terminal as well, as shale gas production in the United States continues to increase steadily.Last month, Reuters reported that Qatar Petroleum is looking to invest as much as US$20 billion in LNG projects in the United States over the next few years, citing the company’s chief executive. The investment is separate, apparently, from Qatar’s plans to boost its production capacity at home.Yet, the US$20 billion won’t be spent just on LNG, Saad al-Kaabi told Reuters in December. Qatar Petroleum will also look into oil production in the United States.



The small Gulf nation, which has been under a blockade from its neighbors led by Saudi Arabia for more than a year now, was until November the world’s largest LNG exporter. In November, Australia took the number-one spot, however, likely motivating Qatar to double down on its production capacity expansion bet.Spurred by the intensifying competition, Qatar last year announced plans to boost its domestic liquefied natural gas production capacity to 110 million tons annually, all from the deposit it shares with neighbor Iran and calls the North Field, and Iran calls South Pars. Qatar can currently produce 77 million tons of LNG from the North Field and since it looks serious about keeping its top spot in LNG exports, an international expansion would make the most sense.Related: BP Beats Estimates, Posts Highest Profit In Five YearsU.S. natural gas production, on the other hand, is rising so fast, analysts last year estimated that new LNG projects will result in between 1 and 2.5 million tons of LNG flowing into the spot market in the first quarter of this year alone.



“We see somewhere between 2.0 to 2.5 million tonnes of additional U.S. supplies in the first quarter. We think probably, most of the 2.5 million will be put into the spot market,” Trevor Sikorski from Energy Aspects told Reuters last September.The Golden Pass expansion will take a while longer, however, with launch of the export facility scheduled for 2024.

The American Petroleum Institute (API) reported a crude oil inventory build of 2.514 million barrels for the week ending February 1, close to analyst expectations that predicted a build in crude oil inventories to the tune of 2.179 million barrels.Last week, the API reported a surprise crude build of 2.098 million barrels. A day later, the EIA confirmed the inventory build, but a smaller one at 900,000 barrels. Oil prices were trading down prior to the data released on Tuesday as investors weigh price support from OPEC’s zealous adherence to the promised production cuts and the dire situation in Venezuela against recent inventory builds in the United States and fears of weak demand growth in the future. Further confusion to oil prices came later in the day on news from the Wall Street Journal that OPEC is looking to officially align itself with a ten-nation group led by heavyweight oil producer Russia to better manage the oil market—a proposition that will be discussed the week of February 18 in Vienna.At 3:41pm EST on Tuesday, WTI was trading $0.80 down on the day (-1.47%) per barrel at $53.76—a rise of less than $1 per barrel week on week. Brent crude was trading down $0.46 (-0.74%) at $62.05—a $1 increase week over week.   



The API this week reported a build in gasoline inventories for week ending February 1 in the amount of 1.731 million barrels. Analysts again were close in their predictions, estimating a build of 1.601 million barrels for the week.Related: Why Are Asian Spot LNG Prices Plunging?US crude oil production as estimated by the Energy Information Administration showed that production for the week ending January 25—the latest information available—averaged 11.9 million barrels per day for the third week in a row.In the third build for the week, distillate inventories increased this week by 1.141 million barrels, compared to an expected draw of 1.814 barrels.Crude oil inventories at the Cushing, Oklahoma facility rose by 889,000 barrels for the week.



The U.S. Energy Information Administration report on crude oil inventories is due to be released on Wednesday at 10:30a.m. EST.By 4:41pm EST, WTI was trading down at $53.66 and Brent was trading down at $62.00.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:ExxonMobil Leads In Exploration Successes In 2018The Next Big Threat For Oil Comes From ChinaEU Still Aims To Circumvent U.S. Sanctions On Iran

Juan Guaidó, the Venezuelan opposition leader recognized as the country’s interim president by the U.S. and several major European countries, plans to drop the requirement that Venezuela’s state oil firm PDVSA hold a majority stake in all joint projects, as the leader looks to boost oil production as soon as possible, Guaidó’s envoy to the U.S. has told Bloomberg.“We want to go to an open economy, we want to increase oil production,” Guaidó’s U.S. envoy Carlos Vecchio said in an interview with Bloomberg.“The majority of the oil production that we want to increase will be with the private sector,” Vecchio noted.



Under current rules, state firm PDVSA has to hold at least 51 percent in all joint oil projects in the country.With Nicolas Maduro’s government and PDVSA running out of cash, crude oil production in Venezuela—the country sitting on the world’s largest oil reserves—has been incessantly falling over the past three years, despite Maduro touting deals with Russia and repeatedly vowing to increase oil production.The economic collapse adds to years of mismanagement and underinvestment in the oil industry to further complicate attempts in Venezuela, one of OPEC’s five founding members, to stop the steep decline of its oil production.



OPEC figures show that Venezuela’s crude oil production dropped by another 33,000 bpd from November to just 1.148 million bpd in December, compared to average 1.911 million bpd for 2017. Earlier this month, Wood Mackenzie analyst Ann-Louise Hittle warned that Venezuela’s crude oil production could fall below 1 million bpd after the United States imposed new sanctions on struggling oil firm PDVSA.“We believe production will likely fall to around 900,000 b/d under pressure from sanctions and a lack of materials for workovers, but we expect waivers will ease the full impact of the sanctions until they expire,” Hittle said.

Tesla is a step closer to imminently starting Model 3 deliveries in Europe as the first cargo ship loaded with its sedans arrived at a Belgian port last night, Electrek reports.In January, Tesla loaded Model 3s for shipment to Europe and China on up to five cargo ships, and one of them has already arrived in Belgium, according to sightings from eager customers in Europe.Tesla expects to begin deliveries of its Model 3 to Europe this month, after receiving in January permission to sell the model in the Netherlands.



The Dutch vehicle authority RDW has added Model 3 to the type of vehicles it has authorized for sale, with which Tesla cleared the final hurdle to start delivering the model to the European market.Just like with U.S. sales of Model 3, Tesla will start delivering in Europe the Long Range Battery version of the midsize sedan.Model 3 is key to Tesla’s vehicle offering as it aims to make its electric cars affordable to more people.



Model 3 will also help Tesla compete on the premium car market in Europe which is being dominated by German brands BMW, Audi, and Mercedes-Benz.Deliveries of Model 3 outside the United States will be a crucial development for Tesla, whose chief executive Elon Musk has said that he wasn’t worried about Model 3 setbacks because of the drop in the U.S. tax credit, as he expected deliveries to Europe and China to take off.In its Q4 Update letter, Tesla said last week that “In January 2019, we started to produce Model 3 vehicles for Europe and China, and the car is now fully certified for sale in these markets. The market opportunity for Model 3 in Europe and China exceeds North America based on the most recent sales of mid-sized premium sedans. Model 3 was designed from the outset for a global market, and shares more than 98% of its parts in common across its regional variants.”  By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:U.S. Seeks To Cripple Venezuela’s No.1 “Vehicle For Embezzlement’’Oil Prices Drop After Touching 2019 HighShale Gas Majors Succumb To Wall Street Pressure

Despite having obtained U.S. waivers to continue importing Iranian oil, Italy and Greece have stopped buying Iran’s crude, Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zangeneh said on Tuesday.“Among the Europeans, except for Turkey, no other nation has purchased oil from Iran. Greece and Italy refuse to buy Iran’s oil despite winning waivers. Nor do they respond to our correspondence,” the oil ministry’s news service Shana quoted Zangeneh as saying.Italy and Greece are among the eight countries that received U.S. waivers to continue importing oil from Iran at reduced rates until early May 2019. Italy and Greece, alongside Turkey and major Asian oil buyers China, India, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, are the eight Iranian customers allowed to continue imports in limited volumes. 



The Iranian oil minister also described the U.S. sanctions as a “unilateral war against Iran’s petroleum industry,” according to Shana.Asked to disclose how much oil Iran has been exporting since the U.S. imposed sanctions on its oil and shipping industries in early November, Zangeneh continued to stick to the Iranian policy not to comment or reveal export figures until its oil is no longer under U.S. sanctions.“I don’t announce any figure about oil exports,” the oil minister said, adding that he would not say how Iran plans to skirt the U.S. sanctions either.



In separate comments regarding the U.S. sanctions on Venezuela’s oil industry, Zangeneh said, “We condemn the US [punitive] actions against Venezuela. Nonetheless, these actions have affected the oil market.”Related: Why Are Asian Spot LNG Prices Plunging?The four major Asian buyers of Iranian oil—China, India, Japan, and South Korea—have recently resumed buying limited volumes of Iranian crude oil, after a period of around a month and a half in which they had to clarify how much and under what conditions they would purchase oil from Iran.Those four major Asian buyers saw their combined crude oil imports from Iran drop to a three-year low in 2018, due to the return of the U.S. sanctions—last year’s Iranian purchases of the four Asian buyers were at their lowest since 2015, the last year before the previous sanctions on Iran were lifted. Although the fresh U.S. sanctions kicked in only in November, Asian importers began reducing their imports of Iranian oil earlier, with South Korea completely suspending imports in August.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:ExxonMobil Leads In Exploration Successes In 2018The Next Big Threat For Oil Comes From ChinaEU Still Aims To Circumvent U.S. Sanctions On Iran

Last year, Venezuela repaid US$2.3 billion of the loan it had received from Rosneft years ago, but the Latin American country still owes another US$2.3 billion, excluding interests, Rosneft said in its 2018 results release on Tuesday.  Rosneft has extended US$6 billion of loans to PDVSA, which needs to be fully redeemed in crude oil supplies by the end of this year.As of December 31, 2017, Venezuela’s state oil firm PDVSA had to repay US$4.6 billion of the loan. Through the course of 2018, it reimbursed half of that amount, excluding interests, according to Rosneft’s 2018 financials presentation. As of December 31, 2018, Venezuela still owed Rosneft US$2.3 billion.



Referring to its oil assets in Venezuela, the Russian oil company said that it has participation in five oil projects and holds 100 percent in a gas project, with export rights.Last week, Dmitry Peskov, spokesman for Russia’s President Vladimir Putin, said that Russia—which stands by Nicolas Maduro in the Venezuelan political crisis—would use “all available legal mechanisms” to defend its interests, including oil interests, in the Latin American country.According to analysts briefed by S&P Global Platts, whatever the outcome of Venezuela’s political impasse, Rosneft won’t be cut off from Venezuelan oil assets, as oil is pretty much the only hard-currency revenue the country can get. An analyst at a Western bank estimates Rosneft’s assets in Venezuela at up to US$2.5 billion, plus another US$2.5 billion in crude supplies for the loan to PDVSA. Even in the unlikely scenario of Rosneft losing all the money it has poured in Venezuela’s oil, the outcome would be “biting but not critical” for the Russian firm, the analyst told Platts last week.Related: Wood Mac: Venezuela’s Oil Output To Fall Below 1 Million Bpd



While Rosneft and Russia are left calculating the potential financial losses from Venezuela’s oil, bond holders of PDVSA are also in a difficult position as trading in PDVSA bonds stopped after the U.S. sanctions on the state oil company and its securities.PDVSA may stop servicing the only bond—notes due in 2020—it has kept on servicing even as it has skipped billions of other bond payments, Francisco Rodriguez, chief economist at Torino Capital in New York, told Bloomberg last week. The 2020 notes are backed by a first-priority lien on a 50.1-percent in PDVSA’s U.S. refining unit Citgo, but Maduro’s regime has no incentive to service the bond since Venezuelan oil-related bank accounts are handed over to opposition leader Juan Guaidó, whom the U.S. and a lot of European nations recognize as the interim president of Venezuela.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Venezuelan Oil Exports Plunge On ‘Harsher’ SanctionsWhy Are Asian Spot LNG Prices Plunging?Oil Prices Drop After Touching 2019 High

Tankers carrying as much as 7 million barrels of Venezuelan heavy crude are sitting in the Gulf of Mexico awaiting some semblance of clarity on how the situation in the South American country will develop after the latest round of sanctions imposed on Caracas by Washington and targeting specifically state oil company PDVSA.Reuters cites shipping data and industry sources as saying some tankers are being put on hold because their cargoes were bought before the sanctions were imposed while others were idling in the ocean because buyers were not sure who they were supposed to pay for the deliveries.



The latter problem, Reuters reports, concerns an aspect of sanctions that bans U.S. buyers of Venezuelan crude to pay for the commodity directly to PDVSA accounts. They are to pay for it by transferring the money to escrow accounts, which have not yet been set up.These accounts will be controlled by Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido, who declared himself interim president last month, as required by Venezuelan constitution in case of problematic election results that necessitate a repeat of the vote, which Guaido is calling for. The U.S. along with several South American countries and a handful of European states have thrown their support behind Guaido and insisted that elected president Maduro call new elections and ensure their transparency.



Yet some are seeing an opportunity, according to Reuters’ sources. Some of the tankers floating in Venezuelan waters and elsewhere in the Gulf are being used as floating storage by traders quick to take advantage of PDVSA offering crude on the open market before the sanctions kicked in.“There were many cargoes of Venezuelan crude already in the Gulf when sanctions were announced,” said one trader who does business with the Venezuelan state firm. Others, however, “cannot find who to sell them to due to sanctions,” the source added.

Four people were arrested in Minnesota yesterday for attempting to shut down an oil pipeline operated by Enbridge, the Associated Press reports, citing a spokeswoman for the group as saying they had called Enbridge to warn them about their plans, but never got to carry them out because the company shut down Line 4 remotely.The group is part of an organization called Catholic Workers and, according to a statement, its members resorted to attempted pipeline sabotage because they felt it was “time to take personal responsibility for preventing the dangerous expansion of the oil industry, because governments and regulators have failed to do so.”



A Minnesota spokeswoman for Enbridge, on the other hand, said, “The actions taken to trespass on our facility and tamper with energy infrastructure were reckless and dangerous. The people involved claimed to be protecting the environment, but they did the opposite. Their actions put themselves, first responders, neighboring communities and landowners at risk.”Indeed, energy companies have been as vocal in their warnings to activists to steer clear of attempts to shut down pipelines as activists have been vocal about their fear of oil spills and protest against the construction of any new pipelines.



Line 4 is not being targeted for the first time, either: the AP recalls a lawsuit that ended last year, when a Minnesota judge dismissed charges against three environmental activists who tried to shut down both Line 4 and Line 67, also in Minnesota, on the grounds that the prosecution had not presented convincing evidence of any harm done.The ruling did not exactly make the defendants happy, however. A lot of activists and their legal advisers have been eager to use a new defense argument dubbed necessary defense in courts. In this case, however, they never got to do this. The necessary defense argument refers to a perception of harm being done to the environment, which required action on the part of the activists.

The European Union (EU) is mulling over imposing more sanctions on Venezuela, but those sanctions will not be targeting the oil sector, as the bloc looks to punish individuals, not the people of Venezuela, Malta’s Foreign Minister Carmelo Abela told Reuters on Monday.“Having further (sectoral) sanctions is not excluded but primarily we are focused on certain individuals,” Abela told Reuters after a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brussels.The EU initially imposed sanctions on Venezuela in November 2017, including an embargo on arms and on equipment for internal repression as well as a travel ban and an asset freeze on 18 individuals. In November 2018, the EU extended those sanctions by another year, “in view of the continuing deterioration of the situation in Venezuela.”



While the United States was quick to recognize opposition leader Juan Guaidó as the legitimate president of Venezuela and imposed sanctions on state oil firm PDVSA, the EU bloc initially said that the voices of Venezuelan people calling for democracy “cannot be ignored.”“The EU strongly calls for the start of an immediate political process leading to free and credible elections, in conformity with the Constitutional order,” the EU said in its early reaction to the Venezuelan crisis, but stopped short of backing Guaidó.Then Germany, as well as Spain, called on Maduro to “immediately” agree to hold new elections, otherwise both EU members would consider backing Guaidó.



After an eight-day deadline for Maduro to call elections expired on Sunday, many of the biggest EU nations, including the UK, Germany, France, and Spain, recognized Guaidó as interim president of Venezuela.  Now more sanctions are in the works against Venezuela, but the EU is unwilling to punish an entire sector, and an important sector like the oil industry at that. According to Reuters estimates, crude oil and products account for three quarters of Venezuela’s exports to the EU.Last week, European buyers of the heavy crude produced by Venezuela’s PDVSA were said to have put their purchases on hold in anticipation of sanctions against the government in Caracas to be announced by the EU.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Could This Material Kill Lithium-Ion Batteries?What’s Behind Saudi Arabia’s New Downstream Strategy?Breakneck LNG Demand Surge In China Is History

Gasoline prices in Russia are the cheapest in Europe, a report by state news agency RIA Novosti showed on Monday.RIA Rating collected and ranked the price of gasoline and diesel in 33 European countries, as well as in the central Asian country and former Soviet republic of Kazakhstan. The ranking showed that Kazakhstan had the cheapest gasoline prices, while Russia’s prices were the second cheapest among the 34 counties ranked—or the cheapest gas prices of a country located (at least partially) on the European continent.In Europe, consumers pay the most for gasoline in the Netherlands, followed by Norway, Denmark, Italy, and Greece, according to RIA Novosti.



Diesel prices are also the cheapest in Kazakhstan, followed by Russia, while Norwegian consumers pay the most for a liter of diesel in Europe, the report found.While Russia has the cheapest gasoline prices in Europe in terms of absolute prices, the purchasing power of its consumers place it only 20th in the ranking of how much gas an average salary can buy. Leaders in this ranking are western European countries, topped by Luxembourg and Norway.In November last year, after oil prices had reached a four-year high the previous month, Russia’s government and domestic oil companies and refineries agreed to freeze wholesale fuel prices until the end of the year to stop prices from going further up—a politically sensitive issue for Russian President Vladimir Putin who had seen his approval ratings drop to a 2012 low with an increase in pension age and higher prices at the pump seeping though inflation.



According to data from GlobalPetrolprices.com, as of January 28, 2019, Russia’s gasoline price was $2.57 per gallon, just ahead of the U.S. gasoline price of $2.59 a gallon.The world’s cheapest gasoline is in Venezuela, but there is the issue how many Venezuelans can really afford to buy gas amid a total collapse in the economy and hyperinflation and political standoff between two leaders claiming to be presidents.Zimbabwe has the world’s most expensive gasoline, after the government of the southern African country doubled fuel prices at the start of this year.

UK’s oil, gas, and chemicals group Ineos called on the UK government on Monday to either lift the seismicity limit on fracking from a currently “unworkable” and too-low ceiling, or end shale altogether without using political backdoors to shut it down.Ineos, which has a shale business unit, holds acreage for shale gas exploration across the UK.  The current 0.5 seismic level, above which fracking at sites in the UK must be halted, “is over 3,000 times lower than the 4.0 level typically found in the United States where over 1 million shale wells have been safely drilled,” Ineos said in a statement.According to regulations, in case of micro seismic events of 0.50 on the Richter scale or higher, fracking must temporarily be halted and pressure in the well reduced.



Another UK company, Cuadrilla, started fracking at an exploration site in northwest England in October 2018, resuming hydraulic fracturing in the UK for the first time in seven years. Natural gas started to flow to the surface from Cuadrilla’s shale exploration well at the Preston New Road site in early November. The company, however, has had to stop operations multiple times, due to micro seismic events measuring above the threshold requiring a halt.In today’s statement, Ineos said:“INEOS calls upon the Government to either make shale workable or shut it down and not to use politically expedient, slippery back door manoeuvres to end shale. British companies have been working in good faith to develop an onshore gas industry in the UK. There are indications that there may be enough gas to make the UK self sufficient in energy for a generation and stimulate huge investment in manufacturing as has been the case in the USA.”  Related: Baker Hughes Upbeat About 2019



“The Government’s position is unworkable and unhelpful. They are playing politics with the future of the country. We have a non-existent energy strategy and are heading towards an energy crisis that will do long term and irreparable damage to the economy and the Government needs to decide whether they are finally going to put the country first and develop a workable UK onshore gas industry,” Ineos chairman Jim Ratcliffe said.Last month, the Financial Times reported that the UK Energy Minister Claire Perry had dismissed calls by Cuadrilla to change the traffic-light system of measuring micro seismic events.Perry said in a letter to Cuadrilla’s CEO Francis Egan that the current system was “fit for purpose” and that the UK had “no intention of altering it,” FT reported, citing the letter it had obtained under the freedom of information legislation.

Tailpipe exhaust emissions in California are on the rise despite the state’s reputation as a leader in climate change initiatives, ranging from cleaner fuels and carpooling, to the highest EV adoption rate in the country.Reuters reports that despite these environmental tactics, which have cost billions of dollars, the state is struggling with constantly rising tailpipe emissions.“The strategies that we’ve used up until now just haven’t been effective,” says the head of the state’s Air Resources Board, Mary Nichols.



The reason for this lack of effectiveness has to do with urban planning more than anything else, it appears. California is the state of long commutes necessitated by urban planning decisions that focused on sprawling single-family houses. This encourages the purchase of more cars than is conducive to tailpipe emissions reduction even with all the EVs taken into account: California buys more than 50 percent of all EVs sold in the country.As a result, harmful emissions from transportation—the number-one source of emissions along with power generation—account for 40 percent of California’s total emissions, according to figures from the Environmental Protection Agency. This compares with an average of 28 percent for the United States as a whole.California is also home to eight of the ten most polluted cities in the United States, a report from April last year found. What’s more, the state has been at the top of the list of most polluted cities for 19 years in a row, ever since the American Lung Association’s State of the Air report began being released.



The authorities of California are not giving up, however. The latest here is an initiative from last December, when the California Public Utilities Commission approved a pilot program that will see the replacement of propane and wood-burning appliances with energy-efficient electric substitutes at no cost for their owners. The initiative, which will cost US$50 million and will run for five years, will target 1,800 low-income households in the San Joaquin Valley, which was two years ago ranked the most polluted area in the United States by the World Health Organization.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Could This Material Kill Lithium-Ion Batteries?Oil Prices Drop After Touching 2019 HighWood Mac: Venezuela’s Oil Output To Fall Below 1 Million Bpd

China’s liquefied natural gas imports broke another record last month amid rising stockpiles that made some importers nervous, Reuters reports, citing industry sources as well as vessel-tracking data.The January total reached 6.55 million tons, up by 2 percent from the previous record set in December. However, the winter turned out milder than would justify this massive intake of LNG and many importers are stranded with more LNG than they can’t sell.“When people see these numbers, they think Chinese demand is up ... but actually it is causing a headache (for importers) as (they) have overbought and can’t find demand to absorb the cargoes,” one energy industry source told Reuters.



Imports of LNG rose substantially throughout 2018, by a whopping 41 percent, as China sought to prevent a repeat of the 2017 gas shortage that left several million households in northern China without heating as the government’s rush to replace coal with LNG for power and heating generation outpaced the development of distribution networks.As a result of this precaution, now LNG traders in China are having to resell their cargoes at lower prices on the domestic market or contracting international buyers.Meanwhile, domestic natural gas production is rising as well as imports but demand growth is set for a slowdown, according to an IHS Markit analyst. Part of the reason has to do with projections for a slowdown in Chinese economic growth, James Taverner told Reuters. Another reason is a slowdown in the pace of switching from coal to LNG-fueled power generation on worries about the security of supplies.



China’s total natural gas demand is expected to rise by 11.4 percent in 2019 over 2018, slower than the growth in previous years, according to analysts at the country’s largest oil and gas producer China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC).At the same time, the country will soon overtake Japan as the world’s largest LNG importer, despite a slowing demand growth pace. By 2022, China will be the country that consumes the most imported LNG.

Elon Musk has reminded his huge Twitter following that all Tesla patents are public and the electric vehicle (EV) maker would “not initiate patent lawsuits against anyone who, in good faith, wants to use our technology.”“All our patent are belong to you,” Musk tweeted in a reference to a poor English translation of a line in a 1980s video game originally made in Japan.More than four and a half years ago, Musk wrote in a Tesla blogpost that “Tesla Motors was created to accelerate the advent of sustainable transport.”“If we clear a path to the creation of compelling electric vehicles, but then lay intellectual property landmines behind us to inhibit others, we are acting in a manner contrary to that goal,” Musk wrote back then.



He reiterated in recent tweets that “Our true competition is not the small trickle of non-Tesla electric cars being produced, but rather the enormous flood of gasoline cars pouring out of the world’s factories every day.”Musk also noted: “Exciting to see all the new electric vehicles coming to market!

Two attacks by the Islamic State in Iraq occurred this weekend, targeting oil police and other security forces, local media report.""One member of an oil police unit died and another was injured,"" a source from the security forces told Iraqi media. The second attack ended with no casualties, with the Iraqi forces able to push the militants back.While Baghdad celebrated the defeat of Islamic State after the battle for Mosul, the last remaining stronghold of the terrorist group in the country, even then there were military experts who warned that not all militants were destroyed in the push and the group will sooner or later resurface.



According to security reports from the Kurdistan Regional Government, this is already happening: according to the Kurdish forces, sleeper cells are waking up and terrorist activity is increasing.Indeed, the number of kidnappings, car bombings, assassinations of local community leaders and attacks on the grid have remained high even after the official end of the war with IS.Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump declared he wanted U.S. troops to stay in Iraq “to watch Iran”, during an interview with CBS.



“I want to be able to watch Iran,” the President said in response to a question about whether the troops will be kept in Iraq in view of a potential military strike against Iran.“All I want to do is be able to watch. We have an unbelievable and expensive military base built in Iraq. It's perfectly situated for looking at all over different parts of the troubled Middle East rather than pulling up.”Despite the still complicated situation in Iraq and the lack of any signs it would get any better soon, the government has big oil plans.

Natural gas and electricity networks in the United States have proved resilient during the polar vortex this week, while natural gas futures prices even dropped during one of the coldest snaps in the Midwest in decades.The natural gas and electric systems across the U.S. have been under less pressure compared to the previous polar vortex in 2014.PJM Interconnection, the electric grid operator for all or parts of 13 states from New Jersey to Illinois, has reported no realibility issues so far. Natural gas use in the United States hit a record on Wednesday, according to estimates by financial data provider Refinitiv, quoted by Reuters.



Some utilities have urged their customers to voluntarily reduce gas use. Consumers Energy of Michigan urged on Wednesday customers to voluntarily cut gas use as a result of an unexpected incident at a Gas Compressor station in Southeast Michigan. The company also required industrial and large business customers to temporarily curtail processes.Even before the polar vortex hit, natural gas stocks for the week ending January 25 were 14 Bcf less than this time last year and 328 Bcf below the five-year average, the Energy Information Administration said on Thursday.Yet, natural gas futures prices for March have been dropping this week while many parts of the U.S. were experiencing the lowest temperatures in decades. As of 11:04 a.m. EST on Friday, natural gas prices were down 0.96 percent at $2.787 per million British thermal units (MBtu).



According to Reuters market analyst John Kemp, traders have been less concerned about natural gas stocks during the winter than they were between September and November, when the Henry Hub natural gas prices soared amid fears that stocks were too low going into the heating season.The polar vortex is expected to be short-lived and so far, this winter has been warmer than average and about the same as last winter.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:The Major Risk That Oil Markets Are UnderestimatingThe World’s Most Extraordinary Oil & Gas CompanyEU Still Aims To Circumvent U.S. Sanctions On Iran

One of the large refiners in the U.S., Citgo Petroleum, owned by Venezuela’s state oil company PDVSA, has denied a report that it was considering filing for bankruptcy, among other options, to protect itself from competing claims over its governance amid the ongoing crisis in Venezuela.On Thursday, The Wall Street Journal reported that a bankruptcy filing was one of the options that Citgo Petroleum is considering. Such filing is neither imminent nor certain, but could be a way to protect Citgo’s operations on the U.S. Gulf Coast and keep them running, The Journal reported, quoting people familiar with the matter.According to the WSJ report, a potential bankruptcy filing could provide some period of calm, but it could also prompt many creditors to start encroaching Citgo to claim repayments. One of those is Russia’s oil giant Rosneft, which has extended a loan to PDVSA. The Venezuelan state oil firm used 49.9 percent in Citgo as collateral for that loan, and if it defaults on the loan, Rosneft could claim that stake in Citgo.



“Citgo has no intention of entering into bankruptcy proceedings,” a spokesman for the company wrote in an email to Reuters after The Journal published its report.“We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet, flat debt levels and liquidity of more than $1 billion into the new year,” the spokesman added.Amid the political impasse in Venezuela, opposition leader Juan Guaidó—whom the U.S. backed last week as the legitimate president—was said earlier this week to be preparing to announce new boards of directors for PDVSA and Citgo.



Guaidó has ordered Venezuela’s congress to appoint new boards at the two companies, Reuters reports. In a tweet on Thursday, U.S. National Security Advisor John Bolton wrote:“Today, President Guaido has asked the workers of Citgo to stay in their jobs during the democratic and economic recovery of Venezuela. The fruits of their labor will no longer be used to facilitate graft and corruption by Maduro.”  By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:The Major Risk That Oil Markets Are UnderestimatingThe World’s Most Extraordinary Oil & Gas CompanyEU Still Aims To Circumvent U.S. Sanctions On Iran

ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) reported on Friday earnings for the fourth quarter easily beating forecasts thanks to production growth, signaling that the Q4 oil price drop didn’t erode Big Oil’s profits as much as the market had feared.Exxon booked Q4 earnings of US$6 billion, down from US$8.4 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017. Yet, earnings per share assuming dilution came in at US$1.41, nearly a third above the analyst consensus estimate of US$1.08 of The Wall Street Journal.  Exxon’s liquids production in the fourth quarter rose by 4 percent from prior-year quarter, driven by growth in the Permian. Oil-equivalent production was 4.010 million bpd in Q4, exceeding 4 million bpd for the first time in nearly two years.A major growth driver of production came from the Permian, where Exxon plans to triple its production by 2025 to more than 600,000 oil-equivalent barrels.



Exxon’s unconventional production in the Permian continued to ramp up in the fourth quarter, the supermajor said, noting that production surged by more than 90 percent from the same quarter of 2017.In Q4, crude prices weakened, while natural gas prices strengthened with higher seasonal demand and increased liquefied natural gas (LNG) prices, Exxon said. Refining and chemical margins weakened in the fourth quarter.Despite weaker margins in the downstream and the drop in oil prices in Q4, Exxon’s full-year 2018 cash flow from operating activities jumped to US$36 billion from US$30 billion for 2017. The 2018 cash flow from operations was the highest since 2014, the company said.In the fourth quarter, cash flow from operating activities rose to US$8.607 billion from US$7.411 billion for the fourth quarter of 2017.  



“Strong results during a period of commodity price volatility demonstrate ExxonMobil’s ability to deliver superior cash flow in different market environments,” Darren W. Woods, chairman and chief executive officer, said.Following the results release, Exxon’s shares were up 2 percent in pre-market trade.  By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.com More Top Reads From Oilprice.com:The Major Risk That Oil Markets Are UnderestimatingU.S. May Have To Back Off Iran Sanctions AgainThe World’s Most Extraordinary Oil & Gas Company

Exxon and Qatar Petroleum will proceed with a US$10-billion expansion of their Golden Pass LNG import terminal in Texas to turn it into an export facility as well, Reuters reports, citing source familiar with the matter.The third partner in the venture, ConocoPhillips, however, will not be joining them in the expansion and has decided to sell the 12.4-percent interest it holds in Golden Pass, the sources also said, adding that Exxon, which has a 17.4-percent stake in the project, is the most likely buyer. Qatar Petroleum is the majority shareholder in the venture with 70 percent.The Golden Pass terminal can accommodate up to 2 billion cu ft of natural gas for regasification right now. The sources did not detail the capacity of the future export part of the facility.



The Reuters sources also noted that Exxon and Qatar Petroleum have been forging closer ties in the liquefied natural gas segment across the world, from Qatar itself to Mozambique and the United States, which has thanks to the shale gas boom become an increasingly important exporter of LNG.At the same time, Qatar is planning huge investments in U.S. natural gas as it seeks to retain the number-one LNG exporter spot, which last November was threatened by Australia. Down Under emerged as the largest LNG exporter globally for that month.Qatar plans to invest US$20 billion in U.S. natural gas, part of a larger U.S. investment campaign by the Qatar Investment Authority that will total US$45 billion as it diversifies away from Europe.



Meanwhile, LNG capacity is growing along with demand. Earlier this week, oilfield services provider Baker Hughes’s chief executive, Lorenzo Simonelli said he expected new LNG projects with a total capacity of 100 million tons per year could be approved this year alone.Global LNG consumption is seen to double by 2030, reaching 550 million tons.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Global Outages Boost Oil PricesVenezuelan Oil Crisis Could Lead To Pirates In The CaribbeanThe Next Big Threat For Oil Comes From China

European buyers of the heavy crude produced by Venezuela’s PDVSA have put their purchases on hold in anticipation of sanctions against the government in Caracas to be announced by the European Union, Reuters reports, citing trading sources.The European Parliament followed Washington’s example in recognizing national Assembly President Juan Guaido as interim president earlier this week, although the agreement to do so was not unanimous. Meanwhile, UK’s Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has urged his European Union colleagues to introduce more sanctions against Venezuela in a bid to increase the pressure on President Maduro and force him out, like Washington hopes with the latest round of sanctions that specifically targeted PDVSA.In Europe, PDVSA trades with Spain’s energy major Repsol, commodity traders Trafigura and Vitol, among others, and Swedish Nynas. Earlier this week, Reuters reported that PDVSA was seeking to renegotiate contracts with oil buyers in a bid to circumvent the new U.S. sanctions.



One source who spoke to Reuters said the Venezuelan company had asked customers to swap oil products, including fuels, for Venezuelan heavy crude instead of payments.“We are trying to redo the contracts. It is not yet entirely clear how because customers are being individually called, but we are studying alternatives,” a source from the Venezuelan state company said.Another tactic PDVSA is using, according to the sources, is asking commodity trading houses to act as intermediaries for its sales of crude to clients abroad, including U.S. refiners.



Despite falling production and exports, Venezuela is still exporting some 1.25 million bpd of crude, of which half a million barrels daily go to U.S. refiners. A the same time, the country imports some 200,000 bpd of refined products, Reuters Eikon data shows. These imports are essential for the functioning of Venezuela’s oil industry as a substantial portion of them are diluents needed to be added to Venezuela’s extra heavy crude to make it fit for export on tankers.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:The Major Risk That Oil Markets Are UnderestimatingU.S. May Have To Back Off Iran Sanctions AgainThe World’s Most Extraordinary Oil & Gas Company

BP will expand its reporting on carbon emissions under investor pressure and as the company seeks to improve its public standing amid increasingly urgent calls for climate action from the oil industry.The agreement, Reuters reports, is with shareholders with a combined US$32 trillion under management and comes on the heels of a similar deal between Shell and its shareholders.However, BP has gone further than its peers, saying part of the more detailed reporting on emissions will include the ways the company is tying its future investment decisions with advancing the climate goals of the Paris Agreement.



The supermajor, which recently announced its first advertising campaign since the Deepwater Horizon disaster that caused what’s probably the most severe environmental catastrophe in the history of the oil industry, also said it will tie the remuneration of some 36,000 employees, including its executive suite, to the achievement of its carbon emissions reduction goals.Last year, again under shareholder pressure, BP said it would keep its carbon emissions flat for the ten years to 2025 even though the company planned to continue raising its crude oil production. To do that, BP said it would reduce its carbon footprint by 3.5 million tons between 2018 and 2025 by pumping more natural gas, reducing methane leakages, and cutting gas-flaring.Also last year, the supermajor said it would invest some US$500 million annually in renewable power, including solar, wind, and energy storage.



“We now know that a race to renewables will not be enough. To deliver significantly lower emissions every type of energy needs to be cleaner and better,” chief executive Bob Dudley said at the time.This year, speaking to CNBC, Dudley said carbon emissions had to be halved, indicating the company’s—and the industry’s—growing acceptance of the need to take climate action alongside governments.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Global Outages Boost Oil PricesVenezuelan Oil Crisis Could Lead To Pirates In The CaribbeanThe Next Big Threat For Oil Comes From China

Non-U.S. companies buying crude oil from Venezuela’s embattled state oil company PDVSA have until April 28 to wind down their purchases, the U.S. Treasury Department said in a note quoted by Reuters.U.S. individuals working for non-U.S. companies outside the United States and Venezuela have until March 29 to carry out “certain maintenance or wind-down transactions,” the note also said.Venezuela is one of the four biggest suppliers of crude oil to the United States, which is one of the country’s biggest buyers, taking in some 41 percent of all crude oil exports.



Washington has doubled down on its efforts to oust President Nicoals Maduro, who was sworn in for a second mandate in early January. Soon after, the President of the national Assembly, opposition leader Juan Guaido, declared himself interim president and called for new elections.Guaido was recognized as Venezuela’s legitimate president by the U.S., Canada, the European Union and a host of South American countries, all of them insisting on new elections. Guaido, in the meantime, said he will soon announce new boards of directors for PDVSA and Citgo.In his statement, Guaido said his government was aiming to ""guarantee the biggest transparency and control"" for PDVSA, adding that it was preparing to ""start the process to name the boards of directors of PDVSA and Citgo to allow the recovery of our industry that is going now through a dark moment.""



The Trump administration also slapped new sanctions on PDVSA, saying the company could avoid the sanctions if it recognized Guaido as the legitimate leader of the country. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said, as quoted by the BBC, the sanctions will involve withholding PDVSA’s proceeds from crude oil sales to the United StatesAcross the Atlantic, UK’s Foreign Minister has called on the EU to institute its own sanctions against the Maduro government.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:The Next Big Threat For Oil Comes From ChinaThe World’s Most Extraordinary Oil & Gas CompanyReuters Survey: OPEC Production Drops Most In Two Years

Canada’s government negotiated a price to buy the controversial Trans Mountain Pipeline at the higher end of estimates, while further delays in the expansion project would reduce the final price that the federal government can obtain when it re-sells it, Canada’s Parliamentary Budget Officer (PBO) said in a report on Thursday.The Trans Mountain expansion has become one of the most controversial pipeline projects in North America as it pitted two provinces—Alberta and British Columbia—against each other. Alberta’s heavy oil producers need more pipeline capacity as their production grows, but pipeline capacity has stayed the same. British Columbia, however, is against any new oil pipelines. The fierce opposition in British Columbia has forced Kinder Morgan to reconsider its commitment to expand the Trans Mountain pipeline, and to sell the project to the Canadian government in August 2018.Canada bought Trans Mountain Pipeline (TMP), the Trans Mountain Expansion Project (TMEP), and related assets for US$3.35 billion (C$4.4 billion), while PBO estimates that the TMP and TMEP have a value of between US$2.74 billion (C$3.6 billion) and US$3.5 billion (C$4.6 billion), assuming that the pipeline is built on time and on budget. PBO’s valuation could be understated, if all related assets are included, the watchdog for Canada’s public finances noted.



Yet, PBO underlined that “One significant finding of this study is that delays in pipeline construction, an increase in construction costs and/or changes in the risk profile of the TMEP (reflected by the discount rate) can negatively influence the final sale price that the Government can negotiate for the TMP, TMEP and related assets.”The PBO calculates that completing the project one year behind schedule would reduce the value of the TMEP by US$528 million (C$693 million), while a 10-percent rise in construction costs would lower its value by US$345 million (C$453 million).As it stands, the Trans Mountain expansion project faces an uphill battle with environmentalists and appeals at courts to be completed “on time and on budget.”



In August, a Federal Court of Appeal quashed the federal government’s approval of the project, saying that the National Energy Board’s (NEB) review was fraught with flaws that made it unsuitable as a basis for the government’s approval. The following month, Canada’s federal government instructed the NEB to review the project again, this time also taking into account the impact of the expected higher oil tanker traffic off the British Columbia coast. “As of January 2019, construction activities on the TMEP continue to be suspended, pending the NEB’s reconsideration of the project in light of the FCA’s ruling. The Government directed the NEB to complete the reconsideration process and its resulting report by February 22, 2019,” PBO said on Thursday.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:The Major Risk That Oil Markets Are UnderestimatingU.S. May Have To Back Off Iran Sanctions AgainThe World’s Most Extraordinary Oil & Gas Company

Enterprise Products Partners L.P. said on Thursday that a pipeline it is converting from shipping natural gas liquids (NGL) to crude oil will begin in February limited operations to ship crude from the Permian to the Texas Gulf Coast, potentially easing some bottlenecks in the basin.“Enterprise is in the process of commissioning facilities related to the conversion of one of the Seminole NGL pipelines to crude oil service,” the company said in its 2018 results release on Thursday.Enterprise expects the repurposed Seminole pipeline to begin limited operations next month and to become fully operational in April 2019.



The repurposed crude oil pipeline is planned to have a capacity to ship around 200,000 bpd, and the conversion of the pipeline is supported by a 10-year contract with firm demand fees, Enterprise Products said.  When it announced plans to repurpose one of its NGL pipelines to crude oil, Enterprise said in December 2017 that after the Seminole conversion is completed, the partnership would have a total crude oil pipeline capacity of more than 650,000 bpd from the Permian to its crude oil hub in the Houston area.Enterprise Products’ announcement that the repurposed crude oil pipeline would begin limited service as soon as February comes a day after ExxonMobil, Plains All American Pipeline, and Lotus Midstream said that they would build a pipeline capable of transporting more than 1 million barrels per day of crude oil and condensate from the Permian in West Texas to the Texas Gulf Coast.



Also on Wednesday, Magellan Midstream Partners and Navigator Energy Services said they were extending the open season to solicit commitments from shippers for the potential new Voyager pipeline to transport various grades of light crude oil and condensate from Cushing, Oklahoma to Houston, Texas.“Significant interest has been expressed from potential shippers, particularly those reaching Voyager from connecting carriers,” the companies said.   By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:EU Still Aims To Circumvent U.S. Sanctions On IranVenezuelan Oil Crisis Could Lead To Pirates In The CaribbeanThe Major Risk That Oil Markets Are Underestimating

The Supreme Court of Canada ruled on Thursday that bankrupt oil and gas companies must first clean up their old inactive wells before selling active profitable wells to repay creditors, overturning two lower court decisions and setting a precedent for the entire Canadian energy industry.“Bankruptcy is not a licence to ignore rules, and insolvency professionals are bound by and must comply with valid provincial laws during bankruptcy,” Chief Justice Richard Wagner wrote in the Supreme Court’s 5-2 ruling.The Supreme Court heard the case, which stemmed from the bankruptcy of a small Canadian oil and gas company, Redwater Energy Corp, in 2015. The following creditor claims created a legal dispute over who should pay for abandoned wells and whether creditors should have priority over environmental cleanup in case of energy bankruptcies.



In the receivership proceedings that followed, the receiver, Grant Thornton, disclaimed the non-producing wells, and wanted to sell producing profitable wells to pay the creditors, leaving the non-profitable wells to the industry-funded Orphan Well Association to clean up. The Alberta Energy Regulator (AER), however, argued that it is the energy companies that must pay for abandoned wells, and receivers should sell producing wells to pay for remediation of non-producing wells.The Supreme Court’s ruling overturns two lower court decisions that had sided with the receiver. The Supreme Court essentially said that bankrupt oil and gas firms can’t walk away from their responsibilities to clean up the old abandoned wells and leave the energy regulators or other associations to clean up their wells.Commenting on the Supreme Court’s ruling, Keith Wilson, a lawyer representing landowners with oil and natural gas wells on their land, told CBC News: “This is good news for landowners, taxpayers and the environment.” 



“The concept of polluter pays is alive and well in Canada,” Wilson said.According to the Orphan Well Association, as of January 28, 2019, Canada had 3,127 orphan wells for abandonment.

After months of deliberations, European countries have set up the special payment channel to handle trade with Iran that would allow transactions with Iran, including oil, as the European Union (EU) still works to salvage the nuclear deal with Iran, German broadcaster NDR reported on Thursday.Germany, France, and the UK have created the payment channel—‘Instrument in Support Of Trade Exchanges’ (INSTEX)—which will be an alternative channel for transactions with Iran. INSTEX will be based in Paris and managed by an experienced German banker, while the UK will chair the vehicle’s supervisory board, according to the German broadcaster.



Months before the U.S. sanctions on Iran’s oil returned, the EU pledged to create a new payment system, the so-called special-purpose vehicle (SPV), that “will assist and provide reassurance to European businesses wishing to continue trading with Iran, mitigating the effect of re-imposed US sanctions, in accordance with European Law.”The idea behind the SPV is to have it act as a clearing house into which buyers of Iranian oil would pay, allowing the EU to trade oil with Iran without having to directly pay the Islamic Republic.Still, the bloc had been struggling for months with the set-up of such a vehicle because no EU member was willing to host it for fear of angering the United States, the Financial Times reported a week before the American sanctions on Iran returned.



The EU hoped that the payment mechanism would be legally in place by the time the U.S. sanctions on Iran returned, but the vehicle was not expected to be operational until early this year.This week, on Monday, Germany’s Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said that the vehicle “will be registered, it has not yet been registered, but I would say that the implementation of our plan is imminent,” the AP reported.The French Foreign Ministry told CNN on Thursday that a joint statement regarding the payment vehicle would be sent out later in the day when the foreign ministers of the EU meet in Romania’s capital Bucharest.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:The Major Risk That Oil Markets Are UnderestimatingA Rare State Of Affairs For RefinersSofter U.S. Gasoline Demand Weighs On Oil Prices

PetroChina is looking to drop Venezuela’s state-owned oil firm PDVSA as an equity partner in a planned and long-delayed US$10-billion oil refinery and petrochemical complex in southern China, Reuters reported on Thursday, quoting executives and an official with the Chinese company and its parent CNPC.The plan to dump the ailing Venezuelan oil firm is not a result of the new sanctions that the United States imposed on PDVSA earlier this week; the reason behind the Chinese decision is the continuously deteriorating finances of Venezuela’s oil company in recent years, two executives at PetroChina’s parent company China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) told Reuters.“There will be no role of PDVSA as an equity partner. At least we don’t see that possibility in the near future given the situation the country has been through in recent years,” one of the executives said.



PDVSA was initially planned to be an equity partner with a 40-percent stake in the refinery and petrochemical project, with the refinery originally designed to process Venezuelan crude oil and to have a capacity of 400,000 bpd.In the summer of 2018, PetroChina had to reconfigure the refinery—approved in 2011 but without notable progress since—to be able to process crude grades other than Venezuela’s, as the Venezuelan production collapse and deteriorating finances at its oil firm PDVSA were putting future crude oil supplies at risk, S&P Global Platts reported in July.Related: Oil Rallies As Saudis Cut Exports To The U.S.The PetroChina refinery has changed plans and will not restrict crude supply to just Venezuelan oil, but it could be capable of processing other heavy crudes from Middle Eastern exporters such as Saudi Arabia and Iran, a trading executive at PetroChina told Reuters today.



PetroChina’s plan to dump PDVSA as an equity partner not only adds to the pain of the Venezuelan oil firm, but also highlights the cracks in the Chinese-Venezuelan relations.China has extended US$50 billion credits to Venezuela under the form of loan-for-crude deals. Back in 2015, according to Reuters, Venezuela asked for amended terms to repay the debts as it was struggling with plunging production amid plunging oil prices. China, however, has not extended large new loans to Venezuela, but has instead started extending the grace periods or approving minor investments.

Crude oil exports from Iran to its four largest buyers in Asia fell to a three-year low last year because of the reinstatement of U.S. sanctions against Tehran in November, Reuters reports.Although the sanctions kicked in only in November, Asian importers began reducing their imports of Iranian oil earlier, with South Korea completely suspending imports in August.The average daily rate of imports for China, India, Japan, and South Korea was 1.31 million bpd in 2018, according to import data, which was 21 percent lower than the average for 2017 and the lowest since 2015 when Iran was under international sanctions. These were lifted with the signing of the so-called Iran nuclear deal, which allowed the country to rejoin the international oil market.



Still, in December, China and India upped their imports of Iranian crude, while South Korea and Japan began planning for the restart of deliveries. China imported more than 500,000 bpd of Iranian crude last month, with India taking in more than 300,000 bpd during the period. According to Energy Aspects, these two, Iran’s biggest oil buyers, will continue importing crude at the same rate of about 800,000 until May, when the sanction waivers will expire.Yet the December amounts are higher than what Washington said China and India would be allowed to import from Iran: the China allocation was for 360,000 bpd and India’s was 300,000 bpd.“After May, it will all depend on the U.S. administration’s decisions, which at the moment remain completely obscure. On balance, they are likely to extend the current waivers, although rumours are that there could be a significant cut in waivered volumes,” Reuters quoted Energy Aspects analyst Ricardo Fabiani as saying.



Yesterday, S&P Global Platts reported that Japan, South Korea, India, and China are all buying Iranian crude once again, but at much lower rates than they did before November. According to the S&P Global Platts calculations, the rate at which India, Japan, and South Korea are importing Iranian crude at the moment is at least half that of the rate seen before the sanctions went into effect.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:The Major Risk That Oil Markets Are UnderestimatingA Rare State Of Affairs For RefinersU.S. May Have To Back Off Iran Sanctions Again

Basra Oil Co,. the state-owned operator of the huge Majnoon field in Iraq, plans to boost production from it to 450,000 bpd by 2021 by drilling 40 new wells, Reuters reports, citing the Iraqi Oil Ministry.This would be more than double Majnoon’s current rate of production, which averages 240,000 bpd. The 40 new wells will be in addition to another 40, already contracted to Schlumberger last month.



Basra Oil Co. took over Majnoon last year, after Shell, the previous operator of the field, called the project quits. There were reports of other foreign oil companies expressing interest in taking the reins from Shell, but eventually Majnoon ended up in local hands.Iraq had oil reserves of 153 billion barrels as of 2017, and in 2018 Oil Minister Jabar al-Luaibi said the actual reserves could be twice as large. If the higher estimate proves true, it would make Iraq the largest oil-rich country in the world, ahead of Venezuela, which claims its reserves are just above 300 billion barrels, and also ahead of Saudi Arabia.



Basra Oil Co. pumps most of Iraq’s oil, accounting for 75 percent of the total. Last year, a company executive said Basra Oil Co. planned to increase its output to 5 million barrels daily by 2025. Most of the additional production, the executive said, will come from fields that are operated by international oil companies, but some will come from BOC-operated projects.The foreign-operated fields will contribute 1.8 million bpd, director general Ihsan Ismaael told S&P Global Platts last October. These include West Qurna-1 operated by Exxon, West Qurna-2 operated by Lukoil, Rumaila with BP as operator, and Zubair, operated by Eni.However, there is skepticism about Iraq’s ability to boost production so much. A September 2018 report from IHS Markit suggested the country’s oil production will only grow marginally over the next 10 years despite its potential capacity, which stands at as much as 7 million bpd, chiefly because of the still unstable political and economic situation.

Rachel Notley, Alberta’s Premier, said prices of Canadian crude are high enough for producers to start gradually ramping up production again, the Canadian Press reports.Notley ordered a production cut of 325,000 bpd, starting this month, to clear excess supply and support prices, which last year plunged to the deepest discount to West Texas Intermediate in years, at one point exceeding US$50 per barrel.



The cuts were to be in place for several months until the inventory overhang cleared, and then they were to be reduced to 95,000 bpd. However, Western Canadian Select reacted to the premier’s announcement even before producers began reducing their output. Prices, in fact, rose so fast, that some industry observers noted Canadian crude is becoming less competitive because of the small discount.Now that the primary goal of the cuts has been achieved, Notley said producers could reverse the cuts, boosting their production by a combined 75,000 bpd in February and March.



The announcement comes after one of Alberta’s largest oil producers, Canadian Natural Resources, spoke out against the cuts, arguing they placed an excessive weight on the company relative to its peers.CBC News earlier this week reported, citing a Canadian Natural letter to suppliers, that a revision in the methodology of how the production cuts are applied will saddle the company with an ""unreasonable and discriminatory"" portion of the cuts. This marked a U-turn in the company’s stance on the cuts. Initially, CNR, like Cenovus, supported the measure, unlike Suncor, which was against it from the start as its refining business benefits from low prices, which makes the company a winner wherever prices go.The 95,000 bpd cuts were supposed to be in place until the end of the year as Alberta increases the amount of oil it ships to refiners by railway in the absence of sufficient pipeline capacity. However, as this early easing suggests, they may not be needed for so long.

India’s top refiner, Indian Oil Corporation, is exploring opportunities to sign an annual term deal to buy U.S. crude oil, Indian Oil’s chairman Sanjiv Singh said on Wednesday, as Indian refiners look to diversify their crude supplies amid uncertainties over whether they will continue to be allowed to purchase Iranian oil once the current U.S. sanction waivers expire.“When we go for term, it should have price advantage for us and strategic advantage for us apart from supply sureties. So considering these three we will work out volumes also,” Singh said on Wednesday, as carried by Reuters.The Indian company has not yet decided from which company it would procure U.S. oil, the manager noted.



India received a waiver from the U.S., alongside seven other Iranian oil customers, including the single biggest, China. The waivers allow those eight countries to continue Iranian oil imports at reduced volumes until early May 2019. India’s allowed imports from Iran are about 300,000 bpd.Indian Oil is the single biggest customer of Iranian crude oil and has an annual deal to import 180,000 bpd from Iran in the 2018/2019 fiscal year that ends in March 2019, according to Reuters.The U.S. waiver was for Indian Oil’s current contract, so any new agreement with Iran will depend on the conditions of a possible extension of the waiver, Singh said.



The U.S. has not given a clear signal yet whether it would be extending the waivers, or any of them, once they expire in early May 2019.Ahead of the U.S. sanctions on Iran, Indian Oil bought in August a total of 6 million barrels of U.S. crude oil to be delivered to India between November 2018 and January 2019. In the summer of 2018, while the U.S. was threatening ‘zero’ Iranian oil exports, the biggest buyers of Iran scrambled to secure alternatives in case they were cut off from buying from Tehran.

Gazprom has not been able to obtain a loan from the China Development Bank for part of the US$14 billion financing the Russian gas giant aims to raise for the construction of its Amur gas processing plant, which will be Russia’s largest and the second-largest in the world, Russian business daily Kommersant reported on Wednesday.  This year, Gazprom will use bridge loans for the construction of the Amur plant, Kommersant quoted Gazprom manager Alexander Ivannikov—who is responsible for the company’s financial and economic policy—as saying on the sidelines of the European Gas Conference in Vienna.Ivannikov didn’t specify which bank has extended the bridge loan to Gazprom, but noted that it is neither the China Development Bank, nor Russian banks.Gazprom, however, needed that bridge loan because it couldn’t reach an agreement with the Chinese bank.



Back in November 2018, Ivannikov said that the Chinese were “very tough negotiators” and “saw risks where even Europeans didn’t see any.”Gazprom is in discussions with banks as it looks to attract in 2020 project financing of US$14 billion for the Amur gas processing plant, Ivannikov told Russian media earlier this week.Gazprom has reached agreements with export agencies, which are ready to provide guarantees for US$7 billion, and talks with 27 banks are ongoing, Ivannikov said on Monday.  Gazprom plans to meet those 27 banks today.



According to experts who spoke to Kommersant, the Chinese reluctance to provide loans to Gazprom could be the result of pressure from Washington. Alexander Losev, chief executive officer at Sputnik Asset Management, told Kommersant that China would not openly do anything to provoke new U.S. sanctions or tariffs on its companies.Alternatively, according to Losev, Gazprom could finance the Amur gas processing plant project with its own cash flow, but then this would result in lower dividends.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Chevron Looks To Double Permian Production By 2022U.S. Seeks To Cripple Venezuela’s No.1 “Vehicle For Embezzlement’’Europe To Become An Increasingly Important LNG Market

Declining coal demand in the U.S. and rising demand for natural gas and renewables have hit coal production and the number of active coal mines in the United States has dropped by more than half since peak coal production in 2008, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) said in an analysis on Wednesday.U.S. coal production has declined by more than a third since peaking in 2008, while the number of active coal mines plunged to 671 mines in 2017 from 1,435 mines in 2008, the EIA has estimated.Lower coal demand since 2008 has resulted in closures of smaller and less efficient mines, with most mine closures in the Appalachian region.



“The uptick in mine closures since 2008 has largely been driven by economics, and smaller, less profitable mines have been more susceptible to closures,” the EIA said.At the end of last year, the EIA estimated that U.S. coal consumption in 2018 was expected to have dropped by 4 percent on the year to the lowest level of coal consumption since 1979.The U.S. electric power sector accounted for 93 percent of total U.S. coal consumption between 2007 and 2018. But since 2007, coal consumption in the electricity generation sector has declined, due to retirements of coal-fired power plants and lower utilization rates of coal power plants which have been facing growing competition from natural gas-fired power generation and from renewable energy sources. Coal’s market share has shrunk at the expense of natural gas and renewables, the EIA said. 



In its latest inventory of electric generators, the EIA said earlier this month that wind, natural gas, and solar capacity will lead the new electricity capacity in the United States in 2019, while coal-fired generation will account for more than half of scheduled capacity retirements.In 2019, the U.S. electric power sector is expected to add 23.7 gigawatts (GW) of new capacity, while 8.3 GW capacity is planned to be retired. Among the capacity scheduled for retirement, coal will lead with 53 percent of all planned retirements, followed by natural gas with 27 percent, and nuclear with 18 percent.

ExxonMobil, Plains All American Pipeline, and Lotus Midstream will build a pipeline capable of transporting more than 1 million barrels per day of crude oil and condensate from the Permian in West Texas to the Texas Gulf Coast, the companies said on Wednesday.Exxon, Plains All American, and Lotus Midstream decided to proceed with plans to build the Wink to Webster pipeline system, with origin points at Wink and Midland to multiple locations near Houston, including Webster and Baytown, and with connectivity to Texas City and Beaumont.The companies have formed a joint venture, Wink to Webster Pipeline LLC, and have already ordered 650 miles of domestically sourced 36-inch-diameter line pipe.



The project is the result of a “significant volume of long-term commitments” and is targeted to start operations in the first half of 2021, Plains All American said.The Wink to Webster Pipeline will be aimed at providing pipeline transportation to ExxonMobil and other Permian producers to market destinations in Texas, as U.S. shale drillers look to have more takeaway capacity from West Texas to the Gulf Coast for the continuously growing production in the most prolific U.S. crude oil basin.As per the EIA’s latest Drilling Productivity Report from last week, the Permian’s production is expected to average 3.831 million bpd in January and to rise by 23,000 bpd to 3.854 million bpd in February.



For Exxon, the pipeline project adds to the announcement from earlier this week that the U.S. supermajor reached a final investment decision to build a new crude unit at its Beaumont, Texas refinery that will increase crude refining capacity by more than 65 percent, or 250,000 barrels per day.Last year, Exxon laid out plans to triple its production in the Permian to more than 600,000 oil-equivalent barrels by 2025 and to invest more than US$2 billion in transportation infrastructure to support its Permian operations.   By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Oil Markets Unmoved By Modest Inventory BuildShale Gas Majors Succumb To Wall Street PressureNew Exploration Tech Finds 1.5 Billion Barrels Of Oil In Alaska

Floating LNG projects may have peaked already amid intensifying competition in the liquefied natural gas space, a new report from Wood Mackenzie has suggested.After the oil price collapse in 2014, floating LNG production projects were all the rage as the LNG market became oversaturated and prices tanked, with three of seven large-scale projects that got their final investment decision between 2015 and 2018 being for floating production and storage facilities, Wood Mac’s research analyst, Global LNG, Liam Kelleher said.Since then, however, investors seem to have turned their attention towards higher-capacity onshore projects concentrated in the United States, with capex and operating costs being lower, Kelleher added.



“We expect this trend to continue, with high-capacity projects in the US, Russia, Qatar and Mozambique looking to take FID. The lack of economy of scale is likely to limit FLNG projects to small-scale and remote developments as it competes for buyers, financing and partners in a busy LNG marketplace,” the analyst said.Not all is bleak on the FLNG front, however, according to Kelleher. If LNG producers manage to lower the costs of these projects, chances are this segment of the LNG industry could see a revival in the future.On a global, scale, Wood Mackenzie said in an earlier report, this year could be a record year for LNG projects approved, with more than 60 mmtpa of capacity likely to reach final investment decision (FID). This will be well above the previous record of 45 mmtpa sanctioned in 2005 and triple the 21 mmtpa projects sanctioned last year.



“Frontrunners in the race to hit FID include the US$27 billion Arctic LNG-2 in Russia, at least one project in Mozambique and three in the US. Our picks in the US are Golden Pass, Calcasieu Pass and Sabine Pass Train 6,” the energy consultancy said in its 2019 outlook.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:What’s Behind Saudi Arabia’s New Downstream Strategy?Oversold Lithium Could Be About To RallyTrump Looks To Neutralize Pipeline Opponents

A week after opposition leader Juan Guaidó declared himself interim president of Venezuela, Nicolas Maduro signaled that he was willing to negotiate with the opposition.“I’m willing to sit down for talks with the opposition so that we could talk for the sake of Venezuela’s peace and its future,” Maduro said in an interview published on Wednesday by RIA Novosti, a state news outlet in Russia, which firmly backs Maduro in the political turmoil in the Latin American country.According to Maduro, the governments of Mexico, Uruguay, Bolivia, Russia, the Vatican, and some European governments that he didn’t name, support dialog in Venezuela.The U.S. backed last week Juan Guaidó, the chairman of the National Assembly, as the legitimate president of Venezuela, after Guaidó declared himself interim president. 



Earlier this week, the U.S. Treasury slapped another round of sweeping sanctions against Venezuelan state oil firm PDVSA, in order to “help prevent further diverting of Venezuela’s assets by Maduro and preserve these assets for the people of Venezuela.”On Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted “Maduro willing to negotiate with opposition in Venezuela following U.S. sanctions and the cutting off of oil revenues. Guaido is being targeted by Venezuelan Supreme Court. Massive protest expected today. Americans should not travel to Venezuela until further notice.”Speaking to RIA Novosti, Maduro accused Trump of plotting to assassinate him.“Donald Trump has without doubt given an order to kill me and has told the government of Colombia and the Colombian mafia to kill me,” Maduro said.



“If something happens to me one day, Donald Trump and Colombian President Ivan Duque will bear responsibility,” the Venezuelan leader told RIA Novosti.Meanwhile, the oil market and officials are still trying to assess how the political crisis in Venezuela and the latest U.S. sanctions on PDVSA will impact Venezuela’s exports and the global supply-demand picture.Fatih Birol, the Executive Director of the International Energy Agency (IEA), told Reuters on Wednesday that it was too early to quantify the impact of the latest U.S. sanctions.

It is too early to quantify the impact of the latest U.S. sanctions on Venezuela’s oil industry and exports, Fatih Birol, the Executive Director of the International Energy Agency (IEA), told Reuters on Wednesday.On Monday, the U.S. Treasury slapped another round of sweeping sanctions against Venezuelan state-owned oil firm PDVSA, in order to “help prevent further diverting of Venezuela’s assets by Maduro and preserve these assets for the people of Venezuela.”The U.S. backed last week Juan Guaidó, the chairman of the National Assembly, as the legitimate president of Venezuela, after Guaidó declared himself interim president. “The path to sanctions relief for PdVSA is through the expeditious transfer of control to the Interim President or a subsequent, democratically elected government,” Secretary of the Treasury Steven T. Mnuchin said.



Speaking to Reuters on Wednesday, the IEA’s head Birol said:“There are lots of uncertainties in the oil markets now for different reasons. We are following the uncertainties in Latin America, in the Middle East, and Asia as well.”Venezuela’s top oil clients are the United States, which imported around 500,000 bpd from Venezuela last year through October, as well as India and China.According to Birol, the oil market is currently well supplied, and a lot of U.S. shale oil is coming to the market as well.



Earlier this week, Khalid al-Falih, the energy minister of OPEC’s leading producer Saudi Arabia, said that the political crisis in Venezuela had not had an impact on the oil market and there was no need for any additional measures.While al-Falih sees no need for market intervention, analysts told CNBC on Monday that Venezuela is back in the spotlight of the oil market.“Oil’s ticking time bomb is sure to detonate at some point and the price reaction will be anything but muted,” CNBC quoted Stephen Brennock, oil analyst at PVM Oil Associates, said in a research note published on Monday.

The United States’ energy infrastructure are susceptible to cyberthreats from Russia and China, a new report shows from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), cited by CNBC.Russia, the ODNI reports, now has the ability to shut down power and energy companies, and has been testing US infrastructure in an attempt to determine weaknesses. Russia has already successfully disrupted Ukraine’s electrical distribution network in 2015, and has already penetrated US energy infrastructure in the past, according to US officials, including a nuclear power company.  The NSA in 2017 pointed fingers at Russia’s FSB, claiming it had already targeted US energy firms. 



China, who the ODNI sees as the United States’ top cyberthreat, also has the ability to disrupt critical infrastructure, such as natural gas or oil pipelines, for days or even weeks.Further cyber threats are posed by Iran and North Korea, the report claims, with Iran successfully infiltrating Saudi governmental networks in 2016 and 2017.



The report was provided during the 2019 Worldwide Threat Assessment of the US Intelligence community on Tuesday. Proposals to shore up the cybersecurity pitfalls included Senators Mark Warner (D-Va) and Marco Rubio (R-Fla) Office of Critical Technologies and Security, an agency that would, if created, educate business leaders about the potential dangers of relying on foreign technology and products, such as the Huawei debacle, over which the US Justice Department levied fraud charges on Monday.Researchers from Texas A&M scored a Department of Energy grant just weeks ago aimed at improving US cybersecurity in the wake of such abysmal assessments on the nation’s energy security. The research will focus on development and demonstrating “next-generation tools and technologies to improve the cybersecurity and resilience of the nation’s critical energy infrastructure, including the electric grid and oil and natural gas infrastructure,” according to Texas A&M Today.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Oversold Lithium Could Be About To RallyIs The Downside Risk For Oil Growing?Shale Gas Majors Succumb To Wall Street Pressure

Japan, South Korea, India, and China are all buying Iranian crude once again, but at much lower rates than they did before November when U.S. sanctions kicked in, S&P Global Platts calculations reveal.All four countries, along with another four, were granted sanction waivers for a period of 180 days, with China and India only lowering their intake of Iranian crude, while Japan and South Korea suspended Iranian oil imports ahead of the sanctions.



According to the S&P Global Platts calculations, the rate at which India, Japan, and South Korea are importing Iranian crude at the moment, is at least half lower than the rate from before the sanctions went into effect.India and China are Iran’s largest crude oil buyers, accounting for 80 percent of the country’s oil exports to Asia, which, in total, constituted half of Iran’s overall oil exports. Now, as the sanction waiver window narrows, S&P Global Platts analysts expect Iran’s oil exports to fall to 1.2 million bpd over the first four months of 2019, and further slump to 860,000 bpd in the fourth quarter of the year. This compares with an average 2.7 million bpd in the first few months of 2018, before President Trump pulled the United States out of the so-called Iran nuclear deal last May.



There has been talk among analysts that Washington will probably grant waiver extensions to Iran’s biggest Asian clients who would apparently find it difficult to replace the cheap supplies of Iranian crude with alternative sources cost-efficiently.However, Washington officials have remained firm that there will not be any waiver extensions. Earlier this month, speaking on the sidelines of an oil industry conference in the UAE, the U.S. special representative for Iran Brian Hook said, “We are not looking to grant any waivers or exemptions to the import of Iranian crude,” adding “Iran is now increasingly feeling the economic isolation that our sanctions are imposing ... We do want to deny the regime revenues.”By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Oil Prices Rise As Saudis Pledge Deeper CutsShale Gas Majors Succumb To Wall Street PressureNew Exploration Tech Finds 1.5 Billion Barrels Of Oil In Alaska

South Korea has been buying increasing amounts of U.S. crude oil and will continue to do so this year, Reuters reports, citing data from its service Eikon. This will help narrow the Asian economy’s trade surplus with the United States, improving moods in Washington and strengthening bilateral ties.Over this month and next, for example, imports of U.S. crude oil and liquefied natural gas into South Korea are seen at 18 million barrels and 900,000 tons, respectively.



“At the moment, the trend (of importing U.S. crude) will stay ... The economics for U.S. crude is a little bit better than Middle East and North Sea oil,” Reuters quoted a source from the South Korean refining industry as saying.Last year, according to Reuters data, the U.S. exported 7.87 million tons of crude oil to South Korea, equal to 57.687 million barrels, as well as 4.664 million tons of liquefied natural gas. The country, which is the world’s fourth-largest oil importer, was nevertheless granted a sanction waiver in November, allowing it to import a certain amount of Iranian crude.



South Korea, however, has been staying off Iranian crude for four months in a row as of December. Iranian oil exports to South Korea for full-2018 dived by more than 60 percent to 58.2 million barrels, according to the Korea National Oil Corp. data, from 147.87 million barrels a year earlier. At the same time, December imports of U.S. crude surged sixfold to 13.61 million barrels, S&P Global Platts reported earlier this month.There were reports South Korea will resume Iranian imports this month or in February, which will leave it a narrow window to stock up on cheap Iranian crude before the sanction waivers expire. In the meantime, the U.S. has become the country’s sixth-largest supplier, overtaking Iran and Russia, and its third-largest LNG supplier. South Korea, for its part, became the U.S.’ largest LNG client last year.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Shale Gas Majors Succumb To Wall Street PressureNew Exploration Tech Finds 1.5 Billion Barrels Of Oil In AlaskaOil Prices Rise As Saudis Pledge Deeper Cuts

The American Petroleum Institute (API) reported a crude oil inventory build of 2.098 million barrels for the week ending Jan 25, compared to analyst expectations that we would see a much larger buildup in crude oil inventories to the tune of 7.97 million barrels.Last week, the API reported a surprise crude build of 6.55 million barrels. A day later, the EIA confirmed the inventory build, but a larger one at 8 million barrels. Oil prices were trading up prior to the data released, buoyed in part by unrest in Venezuela and the additional sanctions that may disrupt heavy oil flows to the United States, combined with Saudi Arabia’s pledge to cut its oil production more deeply, even as more and more barrels are removed from the market courtesy of Venezuela and Libya.



At 4:03pm EST on Tuesday, WTI was trading up on the day $1.22 (+2.35%) per barrel at $53.20—a rise of less than $1 per barrel week on week. Brent crude was trading up $1.27 (+2.12%) at $61.08—near flat week on week.  The API this week reported a build in gasoline inventories for week ending January 25 in the amount of 2.2 million barrels. Analysts had predicted a build of 4.050 million barrels for the week.US crude oil production as estimated by the Energy Information Administration showed that production for the week ending January 18—the latest information available—stayed at 11.9 million bpd.



Distillate inventories also increased this week by 211,000 barrels, compared to an expected draw of 617,000 barrels.The U.S. Energy Information Administration report on crude oil inventories is due to be released on Wednesday at 10:30a.m. EST.By 5:10pm EST, WTI was trading up at $53.24 and Brent was trading up at $61.11.

Russia, which stands by Nicolas Maduro in the ongoing Venezuelan political crisis, will use “all available legal mechanisms” to defend its interests in the Latin American country, in which Russian oil giant Rosneft has invested and extended loans to Venezuela’s state oil firm in exchange for crude oil deliveries.Russia will defend its interests in Venezuela within the international law using “all mechanisms available to us,” Dmitry Peskov, spokesman for Russia’s President Vladimir Putin, told Russian media on Tuesday.Russia has kept close ties with Maduro and has extended loans to Venezuela, including oil firm Rosneft lending money to Venezuela’s state-held firm PDVSA. Rosneft has extended US$6 billion of loans to PDVSA, which needs to be fully redeemed in crude oil supplies by the end of this year.According to S&P Global Platts, as of November 2018, Venezuela had US$3.1 billion outstanding loan to repay to Rosneft. The Russian company also has five joint upstream projects with PDVSA in Venezuela.



However, the U.S. Treasury slapped another round of sweeping sanctions against PDVSA on Monday, in order to “help prevent further diverting of Venezuela’s assets by Maduro and preserve these assets for the people of Venezuela.”The U.S. backed last week Juan Guaidó, the chairman of the National Assembly, as the legitimate president of Venezuela, after Guaidó declared himself interim president. “The path to sanctions relief for PdVSA is through the expeditious transfer of control to the Interim President or a subsequent, democratically elected government,” Secretary of the Treasury Steven T. Mnuchin said.Related: The ‘Venezuela Benefit’ For Canadian Oil Producers Is LimitedThe Kremlin considers the sanctions against PDVSA as “illegal”, a sign of “unfair competition” and an attempt to interfere with Venezuela’s internal affairs, Peskov said on Tuesday.



Russia is assessing the potential consequences of the sanctions on PDVSA for Moscow, Peskov added.According to analysts briefed by Platts, whatever the outcome of Venezuela’s political impasse, Rosneft won’t be cut off from Venezuelan oil assets, as oil is pretty much the only hard-currency revenue the country can get. An analyst at a Western bank estimates Rosneft’s assets in Venezuela at up to US$2.5 billion, plus another US$2.5 billion in crude supplies for the loan to PDVSA.“The worst-case scenario -- which is unlikely to materialize -- under which Rosneft loses all the money it invested in Venezuela, would be biting but not critical for the company, with quarterly free cash flow at over $4 billion,” the analyst told Platts.

Brazil is pushing for major state-owned companies to privatize some subsidiaries as the Brazilian government of new far-right President Jair Bolsonaro looks to raise US$20 billion in state asset sales in 2019.State-held oil firm Petróleo Brasileiro (Petrobras) should sell most of its 36 subsidiaries, Brazilian secretary of privatization Salim Mattar said at an investment conference in Sao Paulo on Tuesday, as carried by Reuters.Mattar said that subsidiaries of Petrobras and banks Banco do Brasil SA and Caixa Economica Federal should be put up for privatization as the government wants those state-owned firms to sell many of their units within four years.



Brazil also plans to privatize utility Eletrobras via additional share sales on the market, the secretary of privatization said.At state firm Petrobras, the new chief executive Roberto Castello Branco—who was tapped in November by Bolsonaro to lead the company and officially took the reins in early January—had previously advocated for a full privatization of Petrobras.Since he was picked to lead the oil firm, however, Castello Branco has ruled out a Petrobras privatization, but still wants to sell non-core assets of the company to reduce its massive net debt of US$72.888 billion as of the end of the third quarter of 2018. Petrobras is the world’s most indebted listed oil company.



“The privatization of the company is not in question. I do not have a mandate to think about it,” Castello Branco said in November.Yet, the sale of non-core assets is expected to continue under Castello Branco, whose strategic vision for Petrobras includes “portfolio management, capital cost reduction, and relentless pursuit of cost reduction.”Between 2016 and end-October 2018, Petrobras sold assets worth US$20 billion, according to Reuters estimates, while Reuters sources said in October that the Brazilian state oil firm could divest another US$20 billion worth of assets through 2019.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Oil Prices Rise As Saudis Pledge Deeper CutsU.S. Refiners Brace For Venezuelan Supply CrunchThe ‘Venezuela Benefit’ For Canadian Oil Producers Is Limited

The President of Venezuela’s opposition-dominated National Assembly Juan Guaido will announce new boards of directors for state oil company PDVSA and its U.S. business, Citgo, UPI reports, citing a statement from the opposition leader.Guaido declared himself interim president of Venezuela last week as protests against Nicolas Maduro intensified. The President of the National Assembly, which the Maduro government refuses to recognize, called for more protests and new elections, quickly winning the support of the United States, Canada, and several South American countries. The EU has also called on President Maduro to hold new elections.



The new appointments are likely to only deepen an already strong sense of split personality in Venezuela. With two National Assemblies and now two presidents and governments, a parallel board of directors for PDVSA and Citgo comes on the heels of another round of Washington sanctions targeting specifically PDVSA, announced earlier today.At the announcement, nationals U.S. Treasure Secretary Steven Mnuchin said, as quoted by the BBC, the sanctions will involve withholding PDVSA’s proceeds from crude oil sales to the United States, adding that the company could avoid being sanctioned if it recognized Guaido as the legitimate president of Venezuela.



In his statement, Guaido said his government was aiming to ""guarantee the biggest transparency and control"" for PDVSA, adding that it was preparing to ""start the process to name the boards of directors of PDVSA and Citgo to allow the recovery of our industry that is going now through a dark moment."" The interim President also said the decision to appoint new boards of directors for PDVSA and its only profitable business, Citgo, was part of a drive for ""taking progressive and orderly control of the assets of our Republic abroad"" to ""speed up the political transition.""Venezuela is one of the four biggest suppliers of crude oil to the United States, which is one of the country’s biggest buyers, taking in some 41 percent of all crude oil exports.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Oil Prices Rise As Saudis Pledge Deeper CutsThe ‘Venezuela Benefit’ For Canadian Oil Producers Is LimitedU.S. Refiners Brace For Venezuelan Supply Crunch

French supermajor Total plans to drill 23 wells this year, three times more than it drilled in 2016 and 2017, with a focus on Africa and Brazil, Reuters reports, quoting the company’s senior VP for exploration, Kevin McLachlan.All the wells will be drilled offshore, in Namibia, Senegal, Mauritania, and South Africa, and also Guyana and Brazil, McLachlan told Reuters.The strategy is a marked departure from Total’s traditional prioritizing of high-risk but also high-return frontier areas and a turn to already producing regions where the chances of striking commercial quantities of oil and gas are higher.



Still, the French company will remain focused on conventional resources, unlike most other supermajors who have joined the rush to U.S. shale throwing billions at acreage and drilling there.The latest news in this respect came earlier today: Total, together with China’s CNOOC, announced a new gas and condensate discovery in the North Sea, where the two operate the Glengorm prospect. The discovery, according to Total, could contain a recoverable 250 million barrels of oil and the superlight crude oil grade.“We were spending a lot of money in frontier,” McLachlan said, adding “Now we want balance.” This balance apparently does not require any major adjustments in Total’s budget. The executive said this year Total will keep its capex in line with last year’s, which was US$1.2 billion, and slightly higher than its 2017 budget, which was US$1.1 billion.



Its spending on frontier regions, however, has declined substantially over the last five years, from as much as 40 percent in 2015, to just 15 percent budgeted for this year. During just two years—2017 and 2018—according to Wood Mackenzie data, Total bought the rights to explore a total of over 189,000 sq km, which made it the biggest buyer of new blocks among the Big Oil majors. Discoveries, however, have been slow to come – something Total hopes to reverse with its focus on mature producing regions.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Oversold Lithium Could Be About To RallyIs The Downside Risk For Oil Growing?Trouble In Paradise For U.S. Frackers

Canadian Natural Resources, one of Alberta’s biggest oil producers, has made a 180-degree turn on the production cuts imposed by Premier Rachel Notley last December to reverse a severe decline in the local crude oil benchmark.CBC News reports, citing a Canadian natural letter to suppliers, that a revision in the methodology of how the production cuts are applied will saddle the company with an ""unreasonable and discriminatory"" portion of the cuts.The letter, seen by CBC News, also said, ""The revised methodology is flawed and clearly discriminatory to Canadian Natural and as a result directly impacts the heavy oil regions of Alberta."" The company, however, declined to comment on it.



CBC News also quoted an Albertan government spokesman as saying, ""We disagree with their characterization and it's disappointing to see them threatening suppliers with job losses when they're being treated the same as other producers. CNRL is being treated fairly and equitably under this policy, which they support, and the company will need to be accountable for their own regional business decisions.”Indeed, initially Canadian Natural was a staunch supporter of the cuts, like peer Cenovus.“We’re probably producing about 200,000 or 300,000 barrels per day of oil in excess of our ability to get that oil out of the province, either by pipelines or by rail,” Cenovus’ CEO Alex Pourbaix told Canadian media at the time.Related: Venezuela Crisis Deepens As The World Take Sides



Not all were on board with the idea, however. “Our position is that government intervention in the market would send the wrong signals to the investment community regarding doing business in Alberta and Canada. And we really do need to take a long-term view and allow the market to operate as it should,” was the statement of Suncor, which has both upstream and downstream operations in Alberta, which makes it less likelyto be affected by low crude prices.The cuts instituted by the provincial government went into effect at the start of this year, at a daily rate of 325,000 bpd, with the goal of reducing excessive supply. Once the overhang was cleared, the plan was to reduce the rate of cutting to just 95,000 bpd, to remain in effect until the end of the year.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Oil Prices Rise As Saudis Pledge Deeper CutsU.S. Refiners Brace For Venezuelan Supply CrunchThe ‘Venezuela Benefit’ For Canadian Oil Producers Is Limited

Pacific Gas & Electric, one of America’s largest utilities, finally filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy on January 29, after weeks of waiting. The company already had missed one long term bond payment. And bond rating agency S&P lowered the utility’s bond ratings to “D,” as in default, even before the filing. That is the lowest possible rating for any fixed income security.But this is an electric utility with about $50 billion of net plant facing fire related liabilities of $20-30 billion according to press reports. And conventional lenders not surprisingly have walked away. No one wants bonds in default. And an equity sale at currently depressed prices would be cripplingly dilutive. PG&E has had to resort to debtor-in-possession financing, which gets to the head of the line when the time comes to collect. Bankruptcy under chapter 11, the company hopes, will permit an orderly process of sorting out its liabilities.Said in a different way, bankruptcy was inevitable. But bankruptcy is temporary. It’s like a month long stay in a convalescent center following an accident. The issue isn’t really what one did in hospital. The real question is what can you do afterwards? The same question faces us here with PG&E’s electric utility franchise.From a short term operating perspective, bankruptcy protections—with its ready access to incremental debtor in possession financing—is preferable to hanging on and hoping.



What does all this mean?First, why is it different this time? The state’s regulators are constrained in ways they have not been before. The liability itself is too large to deal with in traditional ratemaking terms. Ordinarily the state PUC would have created a deferred asset on the company’s books. This new asset would entitle PG&E to a new revenue stream to be collected via higher consumer prices. We do not believe rate increases of the magnitude implied by traditional regulatory response are even remotely possible.Related: Is The Downside Risk For Oil Growing?Second, assume for the moment hefty increases to electric utility bills throughout PG&E’s service area. That would increase the appeal of residential and commercial solar increases significantly. We think it would only take a 5% customer loss for rating agencies to start talking about an industry “death spiral” — where fewer and fewer customers are forced to shoulder the existing utility cost burden, resulting in still higher prices and still fewer customers.Third, you can only buy what someone wants to sell. Municipalization is typically the other option. If management and the board ask for say between 1 ½ and 2 times book value that puts the asking price for the electric utility alone in the $75 to $100 billion range. But more important than price, we have seen that private sector utility managers can fight municipalization efforts for protracted periods of time, so don’t hold your breath. (See city of Boulder, CO in its dispute with utility XCEL.) And the city of San Francisco has expressed no eagerness in this regard and has committed only to issue a report later in the year.



Selling PG&E’s assets for the price suggested would solve most of the company’s problems, giving it enough cash to pay the $30 billion of lawsuits, pay off creditors and leaving something for shareholders, maybe. But it needs a buyer, and the buyer paying that inflated price would have to raise the price of electricity, we suspect, to earn a decent return on that inflated investment. That is another way of saying that the consumer could end up paying, one way or another.This leaves us with another question. If electric utility competition is really coming, why not just let it happen?As for a government purchase of the properties, even municipal service monopolies, like trolley cars, can experience enormous declines in value as newer technologies displace them almost entirely.

Gazprom is in discussions with banks as it looks to attract in 2020 project financing of US$14 billion for the construction of its Amur gas processing plant, which will be Russia’s largest and the second-largest in the world, Gazprom manager Alexander Ivannikov, who is responsible for the company’s financial and economic policy, told Russian media on Monday.Gazprom has reached agreements with export agencies, which are ready to provide guarantees for US$7 billion, and talks with banks are ongoing, Ivannikov said.



This year, Gazprom won’t need funds for the Amur gas processing plant because its financing needs have been covered by bridge loans, the manager noted.  Gazprom is currently holding talks with 27 banks for financing for next year. The Russian gas giant plans to raise US$14 billion for the Amur gas processing plant, including US$7 billion in guarantees from export agencies, Russian media quoted Ivannikov as saying.



Once in full operation, the Amur Gas Processing Plant will be Russia’s largest and the world’s second largest natural gas processing facility, according to Gazprom. The plant is designed to be a crucial link along the Power of Siberia gas pipeline with which Gazprom plans to begin delivering gas to China in December 2019.Construction at the Amur gas processing plant started back in 2015. As of the end of December 2018, the progress on the gas processing plant’s construction was at 24 percent, according to Alexey Miller, the chairman of Gazprom’s Management Committee.The Amur gas processing plant will have a design capacity of 42 billion cubic meters of gas per year. The plant is planned to have six production lines, and the first two lines are currently scheduled for commissioning in 2021. The Amur gas processing plant will also host the largest helium production facility in the world, according to the Russian gas giant.

The political crisis in Venezuela has not had an impact on the oil market and there is no need for any additional measures, Saudi Arabia’s Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih told Russian news agency RIA Novosti in an interview on Monday.Al-Falih said he had not discussed the turmoil in Venezuela with his colleagues at OPEC.  No one has proposed the holding of an extraordinary meeting of OPEC and its non-OPEC partners over the chaos in OPEC member Venezuela, Alexander Novak, the energy minister of the non-OPEC leader Russia, said last week.Venezuela’s opposition leader Juan Guaidó, the president of the National Assembly, declared himself interim president last Wednesday, and the United States supported him against Nicolas Maduro, whom the U.S. Administration declared an “usurper” with no legitimacy to the presidency.



Countries around the world have started to take sides, backing one of the two leaders claiming to be president of the crisis-stricken Latin American nation that holds the world’s largest crude oil reserves. The European Union “strongly calls for the urgent holding of free, transparent and credible presidential elections in accordance with internationally democratic standards and the Venezuelan constitutional order,” the EU said on Saturday. “In the absence of an announcement on the organisation of fresh elections with the necessary guarantees over the next days, the EU will take further actions, including on the issue of recognition of the country’s leadership in line with article 233 of the Venezuelan constitution,” the EU warned.Germany, Spain, and France gave Maduro eight days to call elections, otherwise they would recognize Guaidó as president.Maduro on Sunday rejected the ultimatum.



While Saudi Arabia’s al-Falih sees no need for market intervention, analysts told CNBC on Monday that Venezuela is back in the spotlight of the oil market.“Oil’s ticking time bomb is sure to detonate at some point and the price reaction will be anything but muted,” CNBC quoted Stephen Brennock, oil analyst at PVM Oil Associates, said in a research note published on Monday.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Oil Prices See Best January In 14 YearsPolitical Crisis In Venezuela To Reshape OPECChinese Solar Giant: “The Party Is Definitely Over”

The state-held National Oil Corporation (NOC) of Libya has a budget of US$50 billion to invest in its oil and gas sector this year, as it looks to overcome safety and security challenges and restore oil production to the pre-civil war level of 1.6 million bpd, the chairman of one of NOC’s subsidiaries told S&P Global Platts in Japan.“Fifty billion dollars is the budget for this year to improve oil and gas production and to improve downstream [operations] but most of this is for crude oil,” Shaaban Bsebsu, chairman of Ras Lanuf Oil & Gas Processing Company, told Platts on the sidelines of an industry event in Tokyo.Libya is looking to boost its crude oil production to 1.6 million bpd in 2019 from around 1 million bpd currently, as it aims to solve security issues and invest in the upgrade of the old oil producing systems.Libya plans to have its crude oil production reach 2 million bpd next year, according to the manager.



Bsebsu, however, underlined the security challenges Libya’s oil sector faces, with various militant groups striving to gain control over oil infrastructure and assets.The country’s budget deficit halved in 2018 compared to 2017, thanks to higher revenues from oil, Libya’s central bank said earlier this month.It is the central bank that allocates the budget to NOC, after authorization from the internationally recognized government in Tripoli.Related: The ‘Venezuela Benefit’ For Canadian Oil Producers Is LimitedYet, analysts think that with presidential and legislative elections this year, Libya could continue to face security problems at its oil infrastructure.



Libya’s oil production and exports have been disrupted since early December, due to port closures courtesy of bad weather as well as security incidents and issues at its largest oil field Sharara, which remains shut-in since early December.    NOC’s chairman Mustafa Sanalla said last week that “in order to increase production rates and contribute to national growth, NOC must remain independent and removed from all political or military bargaining.”“NOC reaffirms its call for the immediate and unconditional restoration of security at Sharara. We reject any type of blackmail and intimidation, as we work to improve the lives of every Libyan,” Sanalla said in a statement.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Venezuela Will Continue Exporting Crude To U.S.: MaduroIs The Permian Bull Run Coming To An End?Trouble In Paradise For U.S. Frackers

Oil field services provider Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE) said on Sunday that it is committing to cut its carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalent emissions by 50 percent by 2030, and to reach net zero CO2 equivalent emissions by 2050.Baker Hughes will invest in the advanced technologies it develops to help its customers to cut their carbon emissions.Since 2012, BHGE has managed to reduce its emissions by 26 percent by using new technology and creating operational efficiencies, the company said in a statement. 



“Oil and gas will continue to be an important part of the global energy mix, and BHGE is committed to investing in smarter technologies to advance the energy industry for the long-term,” Lorenzo Simonelli, chairman and CEO of BHGE, said.“Managing carbon emissions is an important strategic focus for our business…BHGE has a long legacy of pushing the boundaries of technology and operating efficiency. Today we take this to the next level by committing to ambitious new goals for ourselves, and to providing lower carbon solutions expected by customers and society,” Simonelli noted.BHGE’s oil and gas consultancy Gaffney, Cline and Associates is also launching a Carbon Management Practice, which BHGE says is the first such consultancy to offer quantitative assessment of carbon intensity, evaluation of carbon solutions, and the accreditation of emission reductions.



BHGE’s pledge to cut emissions comes as the biggest oil companies face challenges in how to win investors back and how to respond to investor demands to start tackling climate change in earnest.Oil majors have been facing an unprecedented pressure from investors to set emission reduction targets. Investors also demand higher returns for sticking through with oil companies during the downturn. The world’s biggest oil companies also struggle to stay appealing to environment-conscious investors, who see them as the main culprits of carbon emissions and global warming.

The American Petroleum Institute reported that a number of records were broken in the energy industry of the United States in December, including gasoline demand, crude oil production, and crude oil exports.In the latest edition of its Monthly Statistical Report, the API said that gasoline demand in 2018 had stayed at a high of 9.3 million barrels daily, the same as during the previous two years, with refinery capacity utilization at 93 percent on average throughout the year.



Crude oil production, the authority said, reached 11.7 million bpd as of December 2018, with exports at 2.4 million bpd on average during the same month, flat on November but a lot stronger than in the first months after the removal of the oil export moratorium.Crude oil demand remained strong, averaging 20.7 million bpd in December and 20.5 million bpd in full 2018, which was the highest number since 2007, the API noted, adding this happened despite the steady and significant growth in international oil prices for much of the year.



Despite the record-high gasoline demand last year, however, supply seems to be excessive, as per a Reuters report from last week. Oversupply of the most popular fuel is pressuring refiners’ margins, an effect reinforced by relatively sluggish demand, which is largely seasonally explained.Over the four weeks to January 18, the Energy Information Administration reported gasoline inventory builds reaching a combined 26.6 million barrels, with the total at 259.6 million barrels, which was the highest inventory level on record.The reason for this is the kind of crude that constitutes most of the U.S. production. The shale oil boom has yielded predominantly light crude, from which gasoline is made, so the most recent surge in production has resulted in more production of the light fuel. However, U.S. refiners have also upped their gasoline output levels as they increase distillate fuel production as well, as it fetches higher margins.

Saudi Arabia is looking to attract almost US$430 billion in foreign investments for a large-scale infrastructure program, Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih told media, as quoted by CNBC during the weekend.“It is quite ambitious but it is over a 10-year period so we have the time to do it,” Al-Falih said, adding that both the local and international private sector will be expected to take part in the ambitious program, which will span the energy, logistics, mining, and industrial sectors.



The funds will go into the National Industrial Development and Logistics Program, which is part of the Vision 2030 economic transformation program pioneered by Crown Prince Mohamed and aimed at reducing Saudi Arabia’s dependence on oil revenues.This transformation has proven to be a challenge in a lower oil price context, but the Kingdom is apparently persevering: Al-Falih also said later today he will announce specific projects that need financing over the next ten years and that are already “ready for negotiations”. These projects, he said, were worth a combined US$18.66 billion (70 billion riyals).



Foreign investment will be instrumental for the success of the program, CNBC and Reuters note, but foreign investment might be harder to come by than imagined as it has been declining steadily over the last decade.In 2008, it reached US$39.5 billion, CNBC recalls, but as of 2017 this had fallen to a meager US$1.4 billion, according to data from the UN. Locally, things are not looking particularly well for potential investors, either. The last oil price crash prompted cuts in many subsidies, which led to higher prices at the pump and consequently various private sector services. Saudi businesses, according to CNBC, are still struggling with these and a 5-percent VAT introduced this month, and unemployment is at an all-time high of 12 percent.The chances of Crown Prince Mohammed’s program working out as planned have been questioned based on this economic context, and they will likely continue to be questioned until specific results materialize.

Several Republican Senators have reintroduced a bill to streamline oil and gas development permitting in the U.S., aimed at boosting mineral revenues for states and reducing regulatory burdens and costs.U.S. Senator John Barrasso (R-WY), together with Senators Mike Enzi (R-WY), John Hoeven (R-ND), and Kevin Cramer (R-ND), reintroduced on Thursday the Opportunities for the Nation and States to Harness Onshore Resources for Energy (ONSHORE) Act.The provisions of the ONSHORE Act eliminate duplicative regulations, which are currently discouraging “oil and gas development on federal land and deprive states and local communities of much-needed jobs and revenues,” Senator Barrasso said in a statement.



The bill gives states the authority to manage the oil and gas permitting processes and the regulatory responsibilities on federal land within their borders. According to the bill’s sponsor and co-sponsors, the Act would promote energy development by cutting regulatory costs and uncertainty, while at the same time boost mineral revenues for the states and create jobs.“Putting states in the driver’s seat will cut down permitting delays, create jobs, promote economic growth and increase America’s energy dominance,” Senator Barrasso said.“I cosponsored @SenJohnBarrasso's ONSHORE Act, which would make it easier for states to manage oil & gas permitting & regulatory responsibilities on federal land. Empowering states can help create more jobs, more local revenue & keep energy prices low,” Senator Enzi tweeted.



“It is time to move away from some of the unnecessary, duplicative and burdensome regulations imposed by the federal government that keep us from utilizing our natural resources to their fullest. States like Wyoming, with proven safety and environmental track records, can responsibly issue permits more efficiently and effectively to help realize that potential,” Senator Enzi added.“Duplicative and overreaching federal regulations are wasteful, bad for the economy, and harmful to the environment,” Senator Cramer said.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:The 7 Factors Driving Oil Prices In 2019Private Investment In Natural Resources Hits Record HighBP Remains Bullish On Oil Demand Growth

Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE:RDS.A) is expected to report on January 31 its highest annual profit since 2014, although the oil price plunge late last year may hit Q4 earnings.Shell is forecast to report next Thursday a 39-percent yearly jump in earnings on a current cost of supplies (CCS) basis—its closest metric to a net profit closely watched by analysts—to US$21.9 billion, Press Association reports.If Shell meets those estimates, it would book its highest annual profit since oil prices started crashing in 2014. Yet, fourth-quarter earnings may fall below expectations and below the Q3 profit, due to the massive sell-offs in oil between October and December last year, analysts say.  According to analyst estimates of more than 20 analysts, the consensus for full-year 2018 CCS earnings is US$20.980 billion, with a high of US$21.989 billion and a low of US$20.325 billion.



Fourth-quarter earnings estimates range from US$4.635 billion to US$6.273 billion, with the consensus at US$5.280 billion.As widely expected, higher oil prices boosted earnings and cash flows at Shell in the third quarter in a somewhat mixed results release, which highlighted strong cash flow generation and continued share buybacks.Despite slightly missing estimates, Shell’s earnings in Q3 were the highest in four years on the back of rising oil prices.“Shell will find it tough to match the third quarter’s (Q3) storming quarter, which saw its highest adjusted cash flow in over ten years. The Q4 is currently expected to be very strong as well, but given recent volatility and the rout in the oil price, things may not turn out as well as hoped,” trading provider IG said.



Related: French Total To Enter Saudi Downstream BusinessAccording to the Share Centre: “[G]iven the anticipation of higher supplies from shale and Iranian oil supplies not expecting to fall back as dramatically as previously expected, oil prices during the final quarter wobbled which will no doubt hit Shell’s numbers.”  “Investors though will still expect solid free cash flows and hope that gearing level shave down a little further. For 2018 as a whole revenues and profits should easily breach previous highs set back in 2013 especially since costs have been cut back dramatically,” the Share Centre said.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Is Kuwait’s $500 Billion Oil Plan Overoptimistic?Oil Flat As U.S. Drilling Slows DownWhy OPEC+ Output Cuts Take So Long To Materialize

India continues to trade with Venezuela—a key crude oil supplier to the Asian nation where oil demand is growing fast—despite the ongoing crisis in Venezuela, India’s Financial Express reports.Venezuela’s opposition leader Juan Guaidó, the president of the National Assembly, declared himself interim president on Wednesday, and the United States supported him against Nicolas Maduro, whom the U.S. Administration declared an “usurper” with no legitimacy to the presidency.Maduro, in turn, severed diplomatic ties with the U.S. on Wednesday and gave U.S. diplomats in Venezuela 72 hours to leave the country.India continues to be one of the main buyers of Venezuelan crude oil, diplomatic sources told the Financial Express. Indian refiners keep buying more than 400,000 bpd of oil from the troubled Latin American country, which is sitting on the world’s largest crude oil resources.



In recent months, Venezuela has been the fourth largest supplier of crude oil to India, after Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).According to Financial Express, India imported crude oil from Venezuela worth US$5.8 billion in the 2017-2018 financial year, while imports between April and October 2018 were valued at US$4.6 billion. Amid the ongoing political crisis in Venezuela, India is staying away from recognizing the Venezuelan opposition leader as president.Related: Energy Transition Will Upend Geopolitics



“We are closely following the emerging situation in Venezuela. We are of the view that it is for the people of Venezuela to find political solution to resolve their differences through constructive dialogue and discussion without resorting to violence,” the official spokesperson of India’s Ministry of External Affairs said in a statement on Friday, in response to queries on the situation in Venezuela.“We believe democracy, peace and security in Venezuela are of paramount importance for the progress and prosperity of the people of Venezuela. India and Venezuela enjoy close and cordial relations,” India’s foreign ministry said.Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin held a telephone conversation with Nicolas Maduro, backing him as the official president of Venezuela.“The President of Russia expressed support for the legitimate Venezuelan authorities amid the worsening of the internal political crisis provoked from outside the country. He emphasised that destructive external interference is a gross violation of the fundamental norms of international law,” the Kremlin said.  By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:The 7 Factors Driving Oil Prices In 2019Private Investment In Natural Resources Hits Record HighBP Remains Bullish On Oil Demand Growth

So far this winter, Europe has been the biggest buyer of U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG), and despite the fact that the key reason has been profit rather than politics, U.S. LNG cargoes have been increasing its share of a market dominated by pipeline supplies from Russia and Norway, a Reuters analysis showed on Friday.U.S. officials and LNG industry managers have expressed confidence that the United States can compete with Russia on the European natural gas market, of which Gazprom holds more than a third. The U.S. Administration has been keen to sell American LNG to European countries to help them diversify away from Russia’s natural gas dominance.In Eastern Europe, Poland and Lithuania—which see reducing Russian gas dependence as an issue of national security—have signed LNG supply deals with U.S. companies.In the rest of Europe, however, it’s the current market and prices that dictate how much U.S. LNG will be shipped.



With Asian LNG prices at their weakest in three years so far this winter, U.S. LNG cargoes have found home in Europe, which is traditionally viewed as the market of last resort for LNG suppliers.  Currently, Europe is the largest buyer of U.S. LNG after shipments surged fivefold compared to the previous winter season, according to the Reuters analysis. Europe overtook Mexico and South Korea as the single biggest destination for U.S. LNG exports.Related: Saudi Arabia: We’ll Pump The World’s Very Last Barrel Of OilIn the fourth quarter of 2014, as winter approached in the northern hemisphere, total U.S. LNG exports surged, and Europe has been the biggest buyer in the past few months, according to shipping data from Refinitiv Eikon compiled by Reuters.



The key reason for the surge in European imports of U.S. LNG has been the fact that Asian LNG prices this winter have been the lowest in at three years as major buyers—especially China—stockpiled gas well ahead of the winter. Milder winter weather in some parts of Asia and high stockpiles mean that there is currently little appetite for spot cargoes.Asian LNG spot prices have been falling in December and January to their lowest level since the 2015/16 winter, according to Reuters estimates. The average US$8.8 MmBtu Asian LNG price has been just $1 MmBtu higher than Europe’s, which has not been enough to cover shipping costs to Asia.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Modest Rig Count Gain Caps Oil PricesShale Pioneer Hamm: Output Growth Could Fall By 50%U.S. Set To Pump More Oil Than Russia And Saudis Combined

Exxon has inked a preliminary agreement with Germany Uniper for future LNG supplies to a new import terminal in Wilhelmshaven, Reuters reports, citing the German company.The Wilhelmshaven project is Germany’s first LNG terminal. It will consist of floating storage and regasification facilities and has already attracted the interest of several LNG suppliers, including the United States and Qatar. It will have a capacity of 10 billion cu m of natural gas annually.Exxon has signed up for a portion of the regasification capacity at Wilhelmshaven.



“The heads of agreement (a non-binding draft) is an important step towards the realisation of the Wilhelmshaven floating storage and regasification (FSRU) project,” Reuters quoted Uniper’s chief commercial officer, Keith Martin, as saying. The official added that “The FSRU will provide LNG companies from the United States, but also other countries from around the world, with the opportunity to deliver LNG into the German and European markets.”The project will be financed and operated by Japanese Mitsui OSK Lines, which Uniper contracted for the job last December.The German energy major is at the same time member of the consortium building the Nord Stream 2 pipeline from Russia, which has caused opposition from the Baltic States and Poland, along with Ukraine on the grounds more Russian gas coming into Europe will strengthen Moscow’s political influence on the continent.



Washington officials have been vocal in their opposition as well, citing European national security concerns, but their stance has been perceived by some in European governments as a means of securing markets for growing U.S. LNG supply.Exxon is one of the biggest players in this field, with stakes in various projects whose total capacity amounts to more than 65 million tons of the fuel that is growing increasingly popular, not just in Europe but in Asia as well.

Saudi Aramco, in partnership with U.S. Air Products and Chemicals, will build the first hydrogen fuel cell station in the Kingdom, leveraging Air Products’ SmartFuel hydrogen fueling technology, Reuters reports, citing a joint statement.The station, to start operating in the second half of this year, will fuel a fleet of hydrogen vehicles supplied by Toyota. The Japanese carmaking giant was a pioneer in hydrogen fuel cell technology, on which it has worked for over two decades. The result was the Mirai, which was first marketed in 2014. The fleet that will use the new fueling station in Dharan, on the grounds of Air Products’ offices, will be Mirais.""Hydrogen fuel cells offer an effective means for the electrification of transport while maintaining easy, 5 minute refueling and long driving ranges,"" Arabian Business quoted the chief technology officer of Aramco, Ahmad O Al Khowaiter, as saying.



The fueling station is a pilot project whose purpose will be to see whether or not fuel cell vehicle technology has a future in Saudi Arabia and what this future might look like.""The use of hydrogen derived from oil or gas to power fuel cell electric vehicles represents an exciting opportunity to expand the use of oil in clean transport,"" Ahmad O Al Khowaiter said.While potentially very attractive, hydrogen fuel cell technology has not been able to really take off so far. The production of the fuel is a major obstacle to its mass adoption as cheap and efficient methods of making hydrogen have so far largely proven unviable on a commercial scale.



There is also the issue of fueling station networks, of which there are few to date. Hydrogen is tempting because of its abundance and the various ways in which it can be used as a cleaner alternative to oil and gas.Because of this attractiveness of the fuel, investments in the segment have been on the rise: Early 2017 saw the launch of the Hydrogen Council, a group involving several leading automakers as well as Shell and Total, seeking ways to make hydrogen more commercially viable.The council allocated $1.4 billion to the development of energy storage and fuel cell project development until 2020, and has high hopes for the future. Actual progress, however, has been slow in coming.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Huge Backlog Could Trigger New Wave Of Shale OilEnergy Transition Will Upend GeopoliticsIndia’s Crude Demand Growth Shows No Sign Of Slowing

Decommissioning the offshore platforms that have reached the end of their productive life will cost UK taxpayers some US$31.46 billion (24 billion pounds) over the next 45 years, a new report from the National Audit Office.The decommissioning costs for platform operators are rising, the report also noted, saying since 2014, the total annual spent on decommissioning has been about US$1.31 billion (1 billion pounds). This could be worrisome for the government budget because platform operators are entitled to tax relief that lowers their decommissioning costs.



And that’s not all, the National Audit Office says in its report. “With decommissioning activity increasing, the government is paying out more in tax reliefs for decommissioning at the same time as tax revenues have fallen due to a combination of lower production rates, a reduction in oil and gas prices and operators incurring high tax-deductible expenditure,” its authors say.The UK’s continental shelf in the North Sea is one of the longest-producing oil and gas regions globally with some 44 billion barrels of oil equivalent extracted since the start of the boom in the 1970s. However, many fields are now nearing depletion and the platforms pumping the oil need to be decommissioned.



There are currently about 320 so-called fixed installations in the UK North Sea, including platforms and pipelines, that will need to be dismantled in the next four decades as the wells dry up. And the NAO’s US$31.46 billion estimate could turn out to be lower than the actual price tag of the endeavor.“The actual cost to government of decommissioning is highly uncertain as it will depend on how much decommissioning ultimately costs operators as well as future economic conditions, such as oil prices and exchange rates, which determine profits,” the report said.Platform and pipeline operators will have to spend even more: according to calculations by the Oil and Gas authority, as quoted by the Financial Times, their tab will be between US$59 billion (45 billion pounds) and US$101 billion (77 billion pounds).

The heads of the world’s biggest oil companies have been holding closed-doors meeting in Davos this week, discussing two topics common for all oil firms—how to win investors back and how to respond to investor demands to start tackling climate change in earnest.On the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Chevron’s chief executive Michael Wirth has discussed climate change in the context of the oil industry with the top managers at European companies BP, Shell, and Total, and with Saudi Aramco, Reuters reports. ExxonMobil’s CEO Darren Woods was not present.  Oil majors have been facing an unprecedented pressure from investors to set emission reduction targets. Investors also demand higher returns for sticking through with oil companies during the downturn. The world’s biggest oil companies also struggle to stay appealing to environment-conscious investors, who see them as the main culprits of carbon emissions and global warming.



“There is no doubt - and there is a consensus coming here in various meetings in Davos - that our industry is literally under siege and the future of oil is at stake,” OPEC Secretary General Mohammed Barkindo told Reuters.The real challenge of the oil industry is how to win investors back, according to Hess Corporation’s CEO John Hess, who noted that the waning appeal of oil stocks has resulted in the share of energy companies in the S&P 500 dropping in ten years to 5.5 percent from 16 percent.Related: An Unlikely New Hotspot For Energy StorageLast year, the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change issued a special report on the climate situation on the planet, saying that the world needs to spend US$2.4 trillion every year until 2035 if it is to slow down the effects of climate change.



Among oil majors, Shell, for example, plans to double the annual amount of money it invests in renewable energy to US$4 billion, the supermajor’s head of gas and new energy, Maarten Wetselaar told The Guardian in an interview last month. The figure is double the maximum current annual investment Shell has allocated for cleaner energy initiatives but the increase will only materialize if these initial investments prove to make financial sense.Earlier in December, Shell said that it plans to set short-term emission reduction targets and link these targets with executive pay, yielding to growing investor pressure about establishing short-term emission goals.

Boeing successfully completed this week the first test flight of an electric autonomous passenger air vehicle (PAV) prototype to test the autonomous functions and ground control systems.Boeing NeXt, the division leading the company’s urban air mobility plans, designed and developed the electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft with the help of Boeing subsidiary Aurora Flight Sciences.The prototype is powered by an electric propulsion system and is designed for fully autonomous flight from takeoff to landing, with a range of up to 50 miles (80.47 kilometers).Boeing NeXt will proceed with more tests of the prototype “to advance the safety and reliability of on-demand autonomous air transportation,” Boeing said in a statement.



The first flight of the prototype was a controlled takeoff, hover, and landing, while future flights will test forward, wing-borne flight, as well as the transition phase between vertical and forward-flight modes.According to Boeing, the transition phase between vertical and forward-flight modes is generally viewed as the biggest challenge for engineers building any high-speed VTOL aircraft.“In one year, we have progressed from a conceptual design to a flying prototype,” Boeing Chief Technology Officer Greg Hyslop said.“This is what revolution looks like, and it’s because of autonomy,” John Langford, president and chief executive officer of Aurora Flight Sciences, said in Boeing’s press release.



“Certifiable autonomy is going to make quiet, clean and safe urban air mobility possible,” Langford noted.Boeing NeXt is working with regulatory agencies and industry partners “to lead the responsible introduction of a new mobility ecosystem and ensure a future where autonomous and piloted air vehicles safely coexist,” the company said.Boeing is not the only aerospace company testing PAV prototypes. Last year, Airbus said that its all-electric, self-piloted, VTOL aircraft Vahana had successfully completed its first full-scale flight test of 53 seconds, reaching a height of 5 meters (16 feet) before descending safely.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:The 7 Factors Driving Oil Prices In 2019Private Investment In Natural Resources Hits Record HighBP Remains Bullish On Oil Demand Growth

U.S. crude oil production will keep setting annual records until 2027 and will remain higher than 14 million bpd through 2040, thanks to continuously growing shale production, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said on Thursday in its Annual Energy Outlook 2019 with projections to 2050.  The EIA issued forecasts for the next three decades based on a reference case and six side cases that include different assumptions about energy prices, economic activity, and technology and resource estimates.“The United States has been a net energy importer since 1953, but continued growth in petroleum and natural gas exports results in the United States becoming a net energy exporter by 2020 in all cases,” the EIA said.



In the Reference case, the U.S. is expected to become a net exporter of petroleum liquids after 2020 as domestic crude oil production grows and domestic consumption of petroleum products declines.“Near the end of the projection period, the United States returns to being a net importer of petroleum and other liquids on an energy basis as a result of increasing domestic gasoline consumption and falling domestic crude oil production in those years,” according to the EIA.The U.S., which became a net natural gas exporter on an annual basis in 2017, continued to be a net natural gas exporter in 2018, meaning that it exported more natural gas than it imported.



“In the Reference case, U.S. natural gas trade, which includes shipments by pipeline from and to Canada and to Mexico as well as exports of liquefied natural gas (LNG), will be increasingly dominated by LNG exports to more distant destinations,” the EIA says in its outlook.In its January Short-Term Energy Outlook (STEO), the EIA said last week that continuously rising U.S. shale production would make the United States a net exporter of crude oil and petroleum products in the fourth quarter of 2020.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Saudi Arabia’s Dangerous Geopolitical GameCan Mexico Stop Its Oil Production Decline?Saudi Arabia: We’ll Pump The World’s Very Last Barrel Of Oil

No one has proposed the holding of an extraordinary meeting of OPEC and its non-OPEC partners over the chaos in OPEC member Venezuela, Alexander Novak, the energy minister of the non-OPEC leader Russia, said on Thursday.Venezuela’s opposition leader Juan Guaidó, the president of the National Assembly, declared himself interim president on Wednesday, and the United States supported him against Nicolas Maduro, whom the U.S. Administration declared an “usurper” with no legitimacy to the presidency.Maduro, in turn, severed diplomatic ties with the U.S. on Wednesday and gave U.S. diplomats in Venezuela 72 hours to leave the country.



Right-leaning Latin American nations, including Brazil, Colombia, and Argentina, also recognized Guaido, while leftist Cuba and Bolivia support Maduro.Russia, China, and Turkey stay by Maduro, with Russia saying Maduro is the legitimate president and warning the U.S. against a military intervention.Venezuelan state oil firm PDVSA—led by oil minister Manuel Quevedo, a former army officer who holds OPEC’s rotating presidency for 2019—said that “we don’t have any other president” than Maduro.



Asked today whether the political crisis in Venezuela could lead to higher oil prices, Russia’s Energy Minister Novak told news agency TASS that the oil market is very complex and it is difficult to forecast how it would react to the developments in Venezuela.According to the IMF, Venezuela’s economy is expected to collapse by another 18 percent in 2019. More than 3 million Venezuelan people have fled the country amid an aggravating humanitarian crisis and an extreme poverty rate of 40 percent.The economic collapse adds to years of mismanagement and underinvestment in the oil industry to further complicate attempts in Venezuela, one of OPEC’s five founding members, to stop the steep decline of its oil production.OPEC figures show that Venezuela’s crude oil production dropped by another 33,000 bpd from November to just 1.148 million bpd in December, compared to average 1.911 million for 2017.

Russia’s government approved on Thursday a ten-year modernization program for Russian power plants, expected to attract US$28.8 billion (1.9 trillion Russian rubles) in private investments in the sector, Energy Minister Alexander Novak said.  The government approved today a plan by the Russian Energy Ministry to upgrade nearly 40 gigawatts (GW) of installed capacity, which accounts for around 16 percent of Russia’s total installed generation capacity, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said. The project will run through 2031, Medvedev added, noting that Moscow plans to have long-term predictability in electricity prices to provide businesses with long-term predictability of energy costs.



Novak, for his part, said that the program will run between 2022 and 2031. The first competitive selection will be held for 11 GW in April or May, with power supply expected to start in 2022-2024.Related: Aramco Ready To Pour Billions In U.S. Natural GasRussia’s key selection criteria for equipment will be the low cost per kWh, Novak noted. The modernization program will also aim to have as much domestic equipment and engineering as possible, the energy minister added.



According to the BP Energy Outlook 2018, natural gas will stay the leading fuel in Russia’s power generation through 2040. The share of natural gas, however, will drop slightly from 54 percent in 2016 to 53 percent in 2040. The share of nuclear power in Russia’s power mix is expected to grow to 19 percent by 2040 from 15 percent now, and the share of hydropower generation is seen flat at 15 percent. The share of coal in Russia’s power generation will drop from 14 percent to 8 percent in 2040, according to BP. Despite the fact that renewables will soar by more than 7,500 percent by 2040, renewable energy will contribute just 2 percent to Russia’s primary energy demand in 2040, compared with 17 percent on average among the other BRIC nations (Brazil, India, China).Russia will also remain one of the leading fossil fuels producers in the world through 2040, with a share of 14 percent of both global oil and gas production, BP says.

South Korea imported no Iranian crude oil for the fourth month in a row in December, S&P Global Platts reports, citing information from Korea National Oil Corp. During that month, one of the world’s top oil importers increased its intake of crude from Kazakhstan and the United States.Iranian oil exports to South Korea for full-2018 dived by more than 60 percent to 58.2 million barrels, according to the Korea National Oil Corp. data, from 147.87 million barrels a year earlier.At the same time, December imports of U.S. crude surged sixfold to 13.61 million barrels, with imports from Kazakhstan doubling to 6.6 million barrels. Imports from Nigeria also increased, to 1.22 million barrels in December.



""We can continue buying lighter oil from Nigeria and other African counties this year as alternatives to Iranian grades because it is uncertain whether the 180-day waiver is being extended,"" an official from the country’s largest refiner, SK Innovation, said as quoted by S&P Global Platts.Related: Trump Takes Aim At California Emissions LawsHowever, earlier in January, SK Innovation’s CEO told Reuters South Korea will start buying Iranian crude this month or next.“As South Korea received a waiver and has been in talks with Iran about the first import volume, it seems (Iran oil) could be brought in late in January or early February at the earliest,” the chief executive of the company, Kim Jun said.



South Korea could import up to 200,000 bpd of Iranian crude, most of it the superlight grade called condensate: the country was Iran’s biggest condensate buyer before the sanctions and its third-largest importer of oil.South Korea seems to be very concerned about breaching sanctions even having a waiver that allows it to import Iranian crude. It is likely that it will stock up on the attractively priced fuel this month and next, before the waivers expire, especially if Washington decides to not extend, which is widely seen as the less likely scenario.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:The 7 Factors Driving Oil Prices In 2019Private Investment In Natural Resources Hits Record HighBP Remains Bullish On Oil Demand Growth

Venezuelan PDVSA’s crown jewel, U.S.-based refiner Citgo, has idled a gasoline production unit at a small refinery in Corpus Christi, Texas, Reuters reports, citing sources in the know.The sources said the closure had been motivated by economic reasons, since the unit was not making any profit, while Citgo itself said in a regulatory filing it had idled the unit for “non-operational reasons.”



Citgo, Reuters notes, has been running its refineries at lower than usual rates as a result of lack of spare parts, underinvestment, and low flows of light crude that refineries need to mix with Venezuelan heavy crude to produce fuels and other products.Citgo has been in the spotlight recently as the only profitable unit of the troubled Venezuelan oil company, which a Canadian miner is seeking to take control of in lieu of financial compensation for the forced nationalization of its operations in Venezuela by the late Hugo Chavez’ government.



Crystallex, the miner, managed to ink a settlement agreement with Caracas late last year, but quickly afterwards accused it of breaching the agreement and tried to seize control of Citgo through courts, to sell the stock. The breach, according to a lawyer for the Canadian company, was in the form of PDVSA approaching the legal system to overturn a court ruling that gave Crystallex access to Citgo’s stock. The court awarded the miner compensation of US$1.4 billion.Crystallex is also not the only one eyeing Citgo as a means of getting what it claims it is due for the nationalization of its assets. ConocoPhillips also won a case against Venezuela and earlier this year stepped up its efforts to receive its dues by seizing PDVSA assets in the Caribbean. The strategy worked and PDVSA coughed up US$345 million as the first part of a US$2-billion settlement.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Saudi Arabia: We’ll Pump The World’s Very Last Barrel Of OilTrump Takes Aim At California Emissions LawsSyria’s New ‘Militarized’ Oil Companies

The American Petroleum Institute (API) reported a large surprise crude oil inventory build of 6.55 million barrels for the week ending Jan 18, compared to analyst expectations that we would see a small draw in crude oil inventories of 42,000 barrels.Last week, the API reported a crude draw of 560,000 barrels. A day later, the EIA showed that inventories had drawn down 2.7 million barrels from the previous week.In the early trading hours on Tuesday in the run up to today’s release from the API, crude oil prices recovered somewhat from Monday’s economic growth slowdown-driven price slide. But as the trading day drew near its close, prices began falling again as skittish traders balked at Russia’s slight uptick in production in January instead of an expected slowdown per its commitment to cutting production in league with OPEC.



At 4:18pm EST on Tuesday, WTI was trading down on the day $0.41 (-0.77%) per barrel at $52.60—a rise of less than $1 per barrel week on week. Brent crude was trading down $0.39 (-0.63%) at $61.11.  Inventories in the Cushing, Oklahoma facility this week rose by 360,000 barrels.The API this week reported a large build in gasoline inventories as well for week ending January 18 in the amount of 3.64 million barrels. Analysts had predicted a smaller build of 2.655 million barrels for the week.



US crude oil production as estimated by the Energy Information Administration showed that production for the week ending January 11—the latest information available—had risen to 11.9 million bpd—a new record for the United States.Distillate inventories also increased this week by 2.57 million barrels, compared to a smaller expected build of 1.565 million barrels.The U.S. Energy Information Administration report on crude oil inventories is due to be released on Thursday at 11:00a.m. EST.By 4:34pm EST, WTI was trading down at $52.61 and Brent was trading down at $61.11.

The capacity expansion of the world’s largest liquefied natural gas (LNG) exporter, Qatar, has attracted a lot of interest, and oil and gas majors who are Qatar’s long-standing partners, as well as majors that would be new to Qatar’s LNG, are expected to bid for a lucrative share of the expansion project, Reuters reported on Wednesday, citing sources close to the preliminary talks.Qatar announced last year plans to increase its LNG production capacity by 43 percent—from 77 million tons annually now to 110 million tons a year. The new export capacity, with projects to be completed in 2024, is expected to bring in billions of dollars more to the state coffers of the tiny gas-rich country, which is isolated by its Arab neighbors in a bitter feud in the Persian Gulf that has gone on for more than a year and a half now.The four supermajors that hold stakes in Qatar’s existing LNG facilities—ExxonMobil, ConocoPhillips, Shell, and Total—are widely expected to bid in the tender that Qatar Petroleum is expected to issue in search of partners for the expansion, according to Reuters’ sources.



Other majors, including Chevron, Norway’s Equinor, Italy’s Eni, and a Chinese state-held company, are also considering bidding in the tender, the sources told Reuters. Chevron officials have visited Doha for talks in recent weeks and are mulling over bidding for a stake. Even Brazil’s Petrobras was considering bidding, but has recently decided against it, the sources say.According to Jessica Brewer, Principal Analyst, Middle East Upstream Oil and Gas at Wood Mackenzie, Qatar’s new megatrains “will attract mega interest” and will be one of the “global standout opportunities in 2019.”“The upstream segment alone is a world-class asset and operators will struggle to find other low-cost opportunities of this scale,” Brewer said this week.



“QP is unlikely to sole risk the development and will seek partners. However, suitors will need to prove they can add value to win a stake. We expect to see all the incumbents, primarily the Majors, jostling for position,” according to Wood Mackenzie.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Syria’s New ‘Militarized’ Oil CompaniesRussia’s Wealth Fund: Oil Price War With U.S. Would Hurt Russian EconomyWarning Signs Flash For U.S. Shale

CNOOC, China’s largest offshore oil producer, plans its capital expenditure for 2019 to be the highest since 2014 and to increase drilling and development of resources at home after President Xi Jinping ordered companies to boost domestic production.CNOOC said on Wednesday that it has budgeted total capital expenditure at US$10.3 billion-US$11.8 billion (70 billion to 80 billion Chinese yuan) for 2019. Exploration, development, and production capex is set at around 20 percent, 59 percent, and 19 percent, respectively, of the total, the company noted.The capex plan for 2019 is the highest in five years and compares to an expected US$9.3 billion (63 billion yuan) in capital spending for 2018.



CNOOC will focus on exploring large to medium-sized oil fields and to boost exploration of natural gas, Reuters quoted a company presentation as saying.  Spending on exploration and production in China will account for 62 percent of total spending this year, compared with 51 percent capex on domestic resource development and production for 2018.Last week, CNOOC said that it looks to double the number of its exploration projects and proven oil and gas reserves by 2025.



Some of the other big energy producers in China are tapping more tight oil and gas wells, aiming to increase domestic oil and natural gas production at the world’s largest crude oil importer and what will soon be the world’s top natural gas importer.As part of a government push to boost domestic energy supply, China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) and Sinopec are raising investments to increase local oil and gas production and are accelerating drilling at tight oil and gas formations in western China.Oil demand continues to grow in China, while domestic production has been declining in recent years. This has led to additional—and costly—imports, making China the world’s largest crude oil importer. For natural gas, a similar trend is apparent. A government drive to have millions of residents switch to natural gas from coal has resulted in China surpassing South Korea in 2017 to become the world’s second-largest liquefied natural gas (LNG) importer behind Japan.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com: Energy Transition Will Upend GeopoliticsOil Flat As U.S. Drilling Slows DownWhy OPEC+ Output Cuts Take So Long To Materialize

Iran has struck oil in a hitherto untapped region, Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh told local media as quoted by Reuters.“This is the first time we’ve reached oil in the Abadan region,” Zanganeh said, adding that the grade was very light and sweet, but giving no details regarding the amount of reserves contained in the reservoir.



Iran has continued to pursue new oil production opportunities despite U.S. sanctions that have reduced its crude oil exports significantly although probably not as significantly, to date, as planned. As of December, Iran was shipping some 1.3 million bpd abroad, the International Energy Agency said in its latest Oil Market Report.What’s more, Tehran still has partners willing to help with the exploration and production growth. Earlier this month, China’s largest crude oil refiner, Sinopec, offered US$3 billion to Iran’s state oil company, NIOC, to jointly expand the development of a major field in Iran, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing sources in the know.



The sources, who wished to remain unnamed, said the Chinese company considered the offer safe from the sanctions the United States reimposed on Iran last November because the initial deal for the development of the Yadavaran field was inked back in 2007.Sinopec has already invested US$2 billion in the development of Yadavaran, with production there standing at 115,000 bpd, while North Azadegan, operated by NIOC and CNPC, started production at a rate of 75,000 bpd two years ago.Last year, a senior Iranian official said Russia, too, is prepared to invest a lot of money in Iran’s oil and gas industry. One oil company had already, in July, signed a deal to invest US$4 billion on Iranian oil projects, with Rosneft and Gazprom also in talks with the Iranian energy ministry on potential deals that could be valued at up to US$10 billion.

China imported a record-high amount of liquefied natural gas last December, at 6.29 million tons or 25 percent more than in the previous month, Reuters reports, citing customs data.The full-2018 LNG import figure was even more impressive, representing a 41-percent increase over 2017, at 53.78 million tons of the fuel, according to customs data-based calculations by Reuters.



The fuel is getting increasingly attractive as abundant supply pressures prices to a lot more affordable levels than in the past. China is the dream buyer for every producer as Beijing is making a radical pivot away from coal and into more sparing fossil fuels, namely natural gas and LNG.Last year, this pivot cost several million households their heating during the worst of the winter months because the authorities had not planned properly for levels of gas demand and distribution network for the fuel had not been fully developed. This year, to avoid a repeat of the gas crisis, the Chinese authorities, central and local, began storing LNG and natural gas early on.



China imported a total 9.23 million tons of gas, both by pipeline and as LNG, up 17 percent on the year in December. Since it began preparing for the winter early in 2018, total natural gas imports for last year soared by almost 32 percent from 2017 to 90.39 million tons, solidifying China’s position as the world’s biggest importer of the fuel.The country is also shaping up to unseat Japan as the world’s top LNG importer with plans in place to quadruple its LNG import capacity over the next twenty years. The current capacity, spread across 19 import terminals, stands at 2.86 trillion cu ft per year. In 20 years, if the plans are carried out, this will rise to over 11 trillion cu ft per year.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Aramco Ready To Pour Billions In U.S. Natural GasWarning Signs Flash For U.S. ShaleWhat’s Holding Back The Global Energy Transition

Venezuela’s state-owned oil company, PDVSA, said its debt fell by 5 percent last year to US$34.6 billion, Reuters report, citing a statement in a Venezuelan newspaper. Payables to bond holders fell to US$24.7 billion in 2018 from US$25.1 billion a year earlier.PDVSA stopped paying the interests on most of its debt excluding a 2020 bond that is secured with its U.S. business, refiner Citgo. The accumulated late interest payments since the end of 2017 when Caracas stopped paying stands at almost US$8 billion, according to Reuters.



According to the information, the debt decline was attributable to two PDVSA subsidiaries: the parent company of Citgo, PDV Holding, and the Venezuelan Petroleum Corporation, the entity that takes care of the management of PDVSA’s joint ventures.PDVSA tried to restructure a lot of its debt, but U.S. sanctions have prevented it from doing so, except for debts owed to Russian creditors. The sanctions include a ban on trade in Venezuelan debt for U.S.-based entities. Since any debt restructuring and refinancing involves the issuance of new debt, the sanctions have effectively closed the door on this option for PDVSA.



At the end of last year, Bloomberg reported that a group of PDVSA bondholders had gotten together and hired lawyers to see if there was any way to get their money back. Another group had demanded immediate payments from the troubled Venezuelan state company, and an individual bondholder filed a lawsuit against PDVSA at a U.S. court. The report suggests a lot of bondholders are beginning to lose patience, although what they could achieve in reality remains unclear.PDVSA is already struggling to reverse a decline in production resulting from years of mismanagement and the outflow of qualified professionals to maintain the fields, which has caused a slump in its revenues from oil exports. It has agreed with its Chinese and Russian creditors to accept oil shipments as payment, but other creditors are unlikely to accept this option even if Venezuela had the oil production rate to make it possible.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:IEA Chief: EVs Are Not The End Of The Oil EraPrivate Investment In Natural Resources Hits Record HighEnergy Transition Will Upend Geopolitics

Subsidiaries of the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) signed on Tuesday agreements with Iran-based companies aimed at maintaining and increasing the production capacity of nine ageing oil and gas fields in deals worth a total of US$1 billion, the Iranian oil ministry’s news service Shana reported.The agreements signed today are part of a wider plan to have 33 projects for enhancing the production capacity at Iranian oil and gas fields. The 33 projects will be worth a total of US$6 billion in three years, Shana reports.According to S&P Global Platts, the nine deals signed on Tuesday are expected to add nearly 90,000 bpd to Iran’s production capacity within the next three years, while the 33 projects are designed to raise Iran’s production capacity by 281,000 bpd.Iran’s capacity may be increased, but its oil production and exports are currently limited by the U.S. sanctions that returned in early November.



According to OPEC’s secondary sources, Iran’s crude oil production plunged by 159,000 bpd from November to 2.769 million bpd in December. In the third quarter of 2018, before the U.S. sanctions were re-imposed, Iran’s crude oil production averaged 3.603 million bpd.Before the sanctions, Iran was OPEC’s third-largest producer after Saudi Arabia and Iraq, while in December, as per OPEC’s sources, the Islamic Republic was only fifth, after Saudi Arabia, Iraq, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Kuwait.At the signing ceremony for the deals to boost Iranian production capacity, Iran’s Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said that “We wanted to create projects only for Iranian contractors.”  Related: IEA Chief: EVs Are Not The End Of The Oil Era“We wanted to raise hope among local companies as [the US] wants to cause worry and upset Iranian people by the sanctions,” Platts quoted Zanganeh as saying.



Iran will not be complying with the “fully illegal” U.S. sanctions, Zanganeh said earlier this month, in yet another defiant statement from Tehran after the American sanctions on Iran’s oil and shipping industry snapped back.While it stays under U.S. sanctions, Iran will not be discussing the volume or the destination of its oil exports, the Iranian oil minister noted.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:What’s Holding Back The Global Energy TransitionIndia’s Crude Demand Growth Shows No Sign Of SlowingOil Prices Plunge On Fears Of Global Economic Slowdown

Oilfield services provider Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) reported on Tuesday a net income for Q4 beating analyst estimates, on the back of continued recovery in its international business, which more than offset lower demand for completion services in North America.Halliburton posted adjusted income from continuing operations of US$0.41 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2018, excluding a tax benefit related to a strategic change in the company’s corporate structure.The US$0.41 earnings per share compares to an analyst consensus estimate of US$0.37 by The Wall Street Journal.



In the fourth quarter, demand for completion services in North America— Halliburton’s biggest market by revenue—dropped as operators focus on returns, the company said.Total revenues in the fourth quarter came in at US$5.9 billion, down by 4 percent from the revenue of US$6.2 billion in the third quarter of 2018.Halliburton’s North America revenue dropped by 11 percent on the quarter to US$3.3 billion in Q4, mainly due to lower activity and pricing in stimulation services, which were partially offset by higher fluids activity in the Gulf of Mexico. International revenue, on the other hand, increased by 7 percent sequentially to US$2.6 billion, thanks to higher year-end product and software sales in Middle East/Asia and Latin America, partially offset by a seasonal decline in pipeline services in Europe/Africa/CIS.



For the full year 2018, Halliburton’s total revenue rose by 16 percent on the year to US$24.0 billion.Related: Warning Signs Flash For U.S. Shale“Our team optimized our performance in North America as the market softened, and the recovery of our international business continued,” Chairman, President, and CEO Jeff Miller said in the statement, commenting on the fourth-quarter performance.“The trajectory of this cycle has been far from smooth. As expected, in North America, the demand for completion services decreased during the fourth quarter, leading to lower pricing for hydraulic fracturing services,” Miller noted.   Halliburton’s competitor Schlumberger—whose shares jumped last Friday on its Q4 results—said that it expects North America’s E&P operators to likely keep future investments much closer to a level that can be covered by free cash flow, while companies in international markets except for the Middle East and Russia “are starting to see the need to invest in their resource base simply to maintain production at current levels.”  By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:U.S. Oil Outlook Slammed By Lower PricesWhat’s Holding Back The Global Energy TransitionNew Tech Converts CO2 Into Electricity And Hydrogen

The planned closure of all nuclear reactors in Germany by 2022 means that Germany needs to retain half of its coal-fired power generation until 2030 to offset the nuclear phase-out, German Economy and Energy Minister Peter Altmaier said on Tuesday.Germany ordered the immediate shutdown of eight of its 17 reactors in the wake of the Fukushima disaster in Japan, and plans to phase out nuclear power plants by 2022.The phasing out of all nuclear power in Germany means that Europe’s largest economy needs to keep half of its coal-fired generation for another decade and possibly extend the deadline for completely phasing out coal, according to Altmaier.



“No other country getting out of coal is also getting out of nuclear power,” S&P Global Platts quoted Altmaier as saying at an energy conference in Berlin on Tuesday.“The ending of nuclear and the phasing-out of coal should not overwhelm each other,” the minister noted.Germany’s government has tasked a so-called ‘coal commission’ to come up with a timeline for phasing out coal. Hard coal and lignite combined currently provide around 35 percent of Germany’s power generation. The commission is expected to publish its report between January 25 and February 1, in which it is expected to propose the timetable for when the last coal-fired power plant will close. According to experts quoted by Reuters, the date would be somewhere between 2035 and 2040.Related: Warning Signs Flash For U.S. Shale



Germany’s manufacturing industry—a powerful industry that is key to the German economy—is warning against an “overhasty exit” from coal, arguing that energy-intensive companies need to keep their competitiveness and that a swift coal phase-out could result in billions of euros in additional power costs.The UK and Italy—also large European economies—have already set timelines to phase out coal generation, but their timetables are for phasing out coal much sooner—by 2025.Following the end of a consultation period, the UK government confirmed in October 2017 that it would proceed with action to regulate the closure of unabated coal power generation units in Great Britain by 2025. Italy’s government unveiled in November 2017 a new national energy strategy aiming to phase out coal in electricity generation by 2025, and significantly boost the share of renewables in total energy and electricity consumption.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Oil Flat As U.S. Drilling Slows DownIndia’s Crude Demand Growth Shows No Sign Of SlowingPrivate Investment In Natural Resources Hits Record High

Almost half of oil and gas industry professionals around the world see a potential skills shortage as the biggest worry in their sector, according to the Global Energy Talent Index (GETI) survey of Energy Jobline and energy recruitment firm Airswift.A talent crunch is coming to the oil and gas industry, with nearly half of all respondents saying that they were “either quite worried or very worried about an impending talent crisis,” according to the survey of 17,000 energy professionals across the oil and gas, petrochemicals, power, renewables, and nuclear industries.Only 30 percent of oil and gas professionals said that they were feeling ‘relaxed’ about finding talent in the industry, the survey showed. A total of 40 percent see a skills crisis already unfolding in their geographical area, while another 28 percent of respondents see the crisis hitting them within the next five years.  



Respondents in Europe, Asia, and South America were more likely to report that the talent crunch has hit their regions, whereas the figures for North America were slightly below average, the survey showed.The Permian in the U.S., however, could be seen as “a warning sign for the talent crunch that looms over the industry,” according to the authors of the survey. Soaring production growth and increased competition in the Permian has created a massive shortfall. Companies struggle to fill in the talent gap, and even higher salaries can’t attract the needed skilled workforce.Related: Is Kuwait’s $500 Billion Oil Plan Overoptimistic?“The Permian is in a unique situation, but it’s one that we can see playing out across the world as growth continues. In countries where obtaining visas is arduous, companies are really going to be challenged,” Airswift CEO Janette Marx says.



In Texas, home to most of the Permian, job growth essentially stalled in November 2018, despite the fact that production is rising and will continue to rise, according to the latest data from the Texas Independent Producers & Royalty Owners Association (TIPRO).“Job growth in the Texas upstream sector was essentially flat in November compared to many months of consecutive growth. A slowdown in employment was expected due to the impact of takeaway capacity constraints in West Texas, lower crude oil prices, added expense to E&P projects from increasing service costs, as well as rising material costs resulting from steel and aluminum tariffs,” TIPRO President Ed Longanecker said.

New York Mercantile Exchange nearest delivered oil futures and Brent crude on the Intercontinental Exchange traded sharply lower at the start of a new business week amid growing concerns that a systemic slowdown in China’s economy could temper global oil demand.As financial and political leaders gather this week at the Swiss resort town of Davos for the World Economic Forum, investors reassess the global economic growth outlook amid fresh signs of a slowdown of China’s economy. China- the world’s biggest importer of crude reported its fourth quarter GDP growth came in at 6.4 percent, the lowest point in almost a quarter century. This is raising serious concerns over structural growth deceleration in the second largest economy, especially after China reported a sharp drop in its trade figures just a week ago.



Adding to the heightened concerns, the International Monetary Fund revised its global growth outlook down to 3.5 percent for 2019 and by 0.1% for 2020 to 3.6%. Even though, the revisions are modest, the fund’s managing director, Christine Lagarde, said that more significant downward corrections could be on the horizon.Related: Private Investment In Natural Resources Hits Record High



These are just the latest signposts suggesting that the negative impact of the trade war between the United States and China on the global economy may be greater than previously estimated. As Washington and Beijing prepare for the critical round of talks next week, investors will remain focused on economic data coming from China and any signs of a breakthrough between the two economic powerhouses, which rocked global markets for much of 2018.  In physical markets, Russia’s commitment to production cuts was under scrutiny by the International Energy Agency in its monthly oil report released last Friday. The IEA said that Russia’s crude and condensate production climbed by 80,000 barrels a day in December to a “new time high” of 11.45 million barrels. It also noted that “while Saudi Arabia is determined to protect its price aspirations by delivering substantial production cuts, there is less clarity with regards to its Russian partner”. Last week, Saudi Arabia Energy Minister Khalid al- Falih offered a rare criticism on the slow pace of production cuts from Russia that is gradually lowering its output to meet its output cut target of 230,000 b/d by the end of 1Q 2019. Currently, Russia has reduced production by just 30,000 b/d, while the original pledge in Vienna was to cut between 50,000-60,000 b/d for the first month of the year. Investors will continue to keep a close eye on the pace of Russian production through the end of the month for an indication of whether the country is complying with the OPEC deal.By Liubov Georges for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Energy Transition Will Upend GeopoliticsOil Flat As U.S. Drilling Slows DownWhy OPEC+ Output Cuts Take So Long To Materialize

New investments in oil and gas production and refining in the Middle East and Africa region fell by 32 percent last year to US$41 billion, according to the latest annual MENA Oil and Gas Market Report by MEED. This was the size of newly awarded projects in these industry segments.At the end of the year, MEED said, however, there was US$396 billion worth of planned but not yet awarded projects in the region, out of a total US$664 billion in planned and in-progress projects.



The report’s authors acknowledge the strength of oil, gas, and petrochemicals spending in the biggest legacy oil and gas producing region in the world, but adds a word of caution: “But the market is changing. And everyone involved in Middle East oil and gas must be ready to change with it.”The change mainly concerns forecasts about peak oil demand, which is expected to occur sometime between 2030 and 2040, after which it will start declining. This has motivated more spending on petrochemicals as this industry segment is seen to account for a growing portion of crude oil and natural gas demand globally in the future, as demand for fuels declines.



As a result, the Gulf Cooperation Council, which involves six of the biggest producers in OPEC, plans to pour some US$200 billion in new refining and petrochemicals production capacity between this year and 2025, the MEED report notes.The focus, in other words, is shifting from the traditional model of producing as much oil as possible to fuel the local economies, to increasing the value of every barrel produced. The motivation for this shift in focus is not just in future oil demand projections, though. The high volatility in benchmark oil prices over the last few years has made producers change tack,  betting more on value-added refined products.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:India’s Crude Demand Growth Shows No Sign Of SlowingAre Energy Hedge Funds Going Extinct?""Remorseless’’ Cost Reductions Drive Renewable Energy Revolution

The National Energy Board of Canada has approved preliminary, land-clearing work for TransCanada’s Keystone XL oil pipeline, CBC reports, noting that the approval came following a request by the company to be allowed to clear some trees and foliage around parts of the route of the controversial pipeline in anticipation of further developments around the project.In November last year, Montana District Judge Brian Morris, who had earlier ordered the suspension of work on the Keystone XL pipeline, allowed TransCanada to conduct preliminary activities related to the project, including engineering and planning, oil shipment contract confirmations, and the acquisition of land rights, equipment, and permits. Whether the project would go any further than this remains as of yet unclear.



The Keystone XL, vetoed by President Obama and then given the green light by President Trump, will carry heavy oil from Alberta to U.S. refineries. The 830,000 bpd pipeline will run from the Albertan oil sands through Montana and South Dakota, ending in Nebraska, where it will connect to the existing pipeline network that goes on to the Gulf Coast.There has been vocal opposition to the project, with opponents arguing that U.S. refiners simply do not need the additional 830,000 bpd, along with the usual worry about leaks and spills that feature heavily in anti-pipeline protests.



However, with light crude production in the Lower 48 growing fast, U.S. refiners might in fact need the additional amounts of heavy crude, which Gulf Coast refineries require to produce a wider range of products beyond gasoline. The pipeline will also relieve some of the pipeline pressure that Canadian oil producers are facing.Despite the opposition, TransCanada is still upbeat about its construction plans: the company asked permission for the pre-construction work in hopes it will make the 2019 construction season, which will begin in the spring, and complete the pipeline by 2021, as scheduled.

France’s Total will officially endorse a decision to proceed with the development of a new project offshore Nigeria, the Ikike project, Patrick Pouyanné, the chief executive of the oil and gas supermajor, said on Monday.“There is a huge potential in Nigeria, it is probably the most prolific country in west Africa in terms of oil and gas and it is time to launch new projects and we are working on many of them,” Reuters quoted Pouyanné as telling reporters on the sidelines of a meeting of French and Nigerian companies in Paris today.



Pouyanné’s comments come a few weeks after Total started up oil production from Nigeria’s ultra-deepwater oil field Egina, which is expected to produce 200,000 bpd at peak output.The French supermajor began production at the Egina oil field on December 29, Total said early this month. The Floating Production Storage and Offloading (FPSO) unit that was used to develop the ultra-deep Egina oil field is the largest such unit that Total has ever built, according to the French group. Total noted that the plateau production at the ultra-deepwater field would be 200,000 barrels of oil per day, which would account for some 10 percent of Nigeria’s oil production.Related: French Total To Enter Saudi Downstream Business



Total is set to begin exports from the new ultra-deep Egina oil field offshore Nigeria as early as in February 2019, at an initial rate of just over 100,000 bpd, Bloomberg reported in December, quoting a copy of a loading program for the new grade it had seen.In Nigeria, Total operates five production licenses (OML) on the 34 leases in which it has interests, including two exploration licenses. In addition to production license OML 130 where the Akpo, Egina, and Preowei fields were discovered, Total operates other offshore assets such as OML 99 with a 40-percent stake, where the Ikike discovery is located, OML 100 with 40 percent, and OML 102 with 40 percent, where the Ofon 2 project was completed in 2016.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:The World’s Most Geopolitically Charged PipelineIs Kuwait’s $500 Billion Oil Plan Overoptimistic?Oil Flat As U.S. Drilling Slows Down

Saudi Arabia’s crude oil exports jumped by 534,000 bpd month on month in November to 8.24 million bpd—the highest level in years as the Kingdom moved to offset supply losses from Iran with the return of the U.S. sanctions on Tehran’s oil industry.According to data by the Joint Organisations Data Initiative (JODI) database, which collects self-reported figures from 114 countries, Saudi Arabia’s crude oil exports hit a 24-month high, while crude oil production surged to an all-time high of 11.09 million bpd in November.The month before that, Saudi Arabia had increased its October crude oil exports to what was then the highest level since January 2017, when the initial OPEC/non-OPEC production cut deal began.



After the U.S. granted waivers to eight key Iranian oil customers to continue importing oil from Iran until early May this year, Saudi Arabia and its allies at OPEC and non-OPEC Russia pared back production as the market started to fear a growing oversupply amid uncertain demand growth.As a result, OPEC and its Russia-led non-OPEC partners agreed to a new production cut deal in early December, targeting to remove 1.2 million bpd from the market between January and June this year, with Iran, Venezuela, and Libya exempted from cuts due to their ‘special circumstances.’Related: Israel Aims To Become An Energy Export HubSaudi Arabia had already started slashing production as early as December, cutting output by 468,000 bpd from the November all-time high of 11.021 million bpd, to 10.553 million bpd, as per OPEC’s secondary sources—the ones used to calculate compliance and cuts.



Under the deal effective January 1, OPEC’s de facto leader and biggest producer Saudi Arabia is tasked with cutting 322,000 bpd from its October baseline of 10.633 million bpd and keeping output at 10.311 million bpd until June.Just after the OPEC+ meeting in Vienna early last month, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said that the Kingdom would cut production to around 10.2 million bpd in January, and that Saudi crude oil exports would be cut to below 8 million bpd in December from some 8.3 million bpd in November. Saudi Arabia is reportedly targeting to further slash oil exports in January, to around 7.3 million bpd.  By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:French Total To Enter Saudi Downstream BusinessAre Energy Hedge Funds Going Extinct?Libya’s Oil Future Depends On This Huge Oil Field

The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has verified several times that Iran is sticking to its commitments in the nuclear deal, and so should all other signatories to the pact, Iranian media quoted the director of the United Nations Information Center (UNIC) in Iran, Maria Dotsenko, as saying.According to IRNA and Fars news agencies, Dotsenko said that United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres had expressed concern over the United States withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal, as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) is commonly known.The UN will continue to support Iran’s government and nation, and will help the government to provide special packages to the most vulnerable people in Iran, in order to reduce the effect of the U.S. sanctions on Iran’s financial and oil sectors, the Iranian news outlets quoted Dotsenko as saying.



Iran will not be complying with the “fully illegal” U.S. sanctions, Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said earlier this month, in yet another defiant statement from Tehran after the American sanctions on Iran’s oil and shipping industry snapped back in early November.“We believe that we should not comply with the illegal sanctions against Iran,” Reuters quoted Zanganeh as saying.While it stays under U.S. sanctions, Iran will not be discussing the volume or the destination of its oil exports, the Iranian oil minister noted.



The U.S. re-imposed sanctions on Iran’s oil industry and exports in early November, but it also granted waivers to eight key Iranian customers to continue importing oil from Iran for a six-month period until early May 2019.Despite the fact that the U.S. is not looking to grant any waivers to Iranian oil customers when the current ones expire, it shouldn’t be taken for granted that no waivers will be issued, according to the U.S. Special Representative for Iran, Brian Hook, and to analysts and an official with the previous U.S. Administration.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Huge Backlog Could Trigger New Wave Of Shale OilLibya’s Oil Future Depends On This Huge Oil FieldSolar Investment Plunges Amid Panel Glut

Tesla expects to begin deliveries of its Model 3 to Europe in February, after having received permission to sell the model in the Netherlands.The Dutch vehicle authority RDW has added Model 3 to the type of vehicles it has authorized for sale, with which Tesla cleared the final hurdle to start delivering the model to the European market, Bloomberg reports.Just like with U.S. sales of Model 3, Tesla will start delivering in Europe the Long Range Battery version of the midsize sedan.Model 3 is key to Tesla’s vehicle offering as it aims to make its electric cars affordable to more people. 



Model 3 will also help Tesla compete on the premium car market in Europe which is being dominated by German brands BMW, Audi, and Mercedes-Benz.    Deliveries of Model 3 outside the United States will be a crucial development for Tesla, whose chief executive Elon Musk has said that he wasn’t worried about Model 3 setbacks because of the drop in U.S. tax credit, as he expected deliveries to Europe and China to take off.In its Q3 Update letter to shareholders, Tesla said in October that “The mid-sized premium sedan market in Europe is more than twice as big as the same segment in the US. This is why we are excited to bring Model 3 to Europe early next year.”Related: A Logical Move From An Inconsistent Tesla



Model 3 became the best-selling premium vehicle of 2018 in the United States, Musk said in an email to employees last week, in which he stressed the need for Tesla to start delivering profitably lower-priced variants of the Model 3.That’s why Musk announced that Tesla would slash full-time jobs by around 7 percent and retain only the most critical temps and contractors.“[S]tarting around May, we will need to deliver at least the mid-range Model 3 variant in all markets, as we need to reach more customers who can afford our vehicles. Moreover, we need to continue making progress towards lower priced variants of Model 3,” Musk wrote in the email.

Japan has resumed purchases of Iranian crude oil, the governor of the central bank of Iran told state news agency IRNA, Reuters reports.“After China, South Korea, India and Turkey, Japan also started the process of importing Iranian oil,” Abdolnaser Hemmati said.



Japan refinery industry insiders said late last year that they were planning to resume imports of Iranian crude in early 2019, with Trade Minister Hiroshige Seki telling Reuters in November “It would be up to the judgment of private firms, but based on this decision, the (Japanese) companies would likely prepare for resuming Iran crude imports.”Japan is one of Iran’s largest oil importers, but it is also the United States’ staunchest ally in Asia—and the combination of the two has not worked to Tokyo’s advantage. While the government has been trying to secure a waiver from the U.S. State Department, the Japanese economy seems to be dependent enough on U.S. lending to make local refiners extra-cautious. 



Last year, crude oil imports from Iran accounted for 5.3 percent of Japan’s total, but for first five months of 2018 shipments were undeterred by U.S. sanctions. Once President Trump announced he was pulling out the United States from the Iran nuclear deal, Japan and South Korea began preparing for a suspension in Iranian oil imports.The current restart may also be temporary: the current sanction waivers expire in March, and chances are that Japan, like South Korea, will not risk angering Washington unless it expressly extends the waivers, which many observers believe will happen as alternative sources of crude oil at low enough prices are hard to come by.Meanwhile, Iranian oil exports inched up in December from November, according to data from the International Energy Agency, to an average daily of 1.3 million bpd, despite the fact Japan and South Korea were not buying Iranian crude that month.

Chinese crude oil refineries processed an average 12.07 million barrels of oil daily in 2018, up by 6.8 percent on the year and the highest daily processing rate on record, government statistics show, as cited by Reuters.In December alone, local refiners processed 12.05 million bpd, a 4.4-percent annual improvement, the data also showed, reflecting a sharp increase in imports of crude oil in the last month of the year.



China imported 30 percent more crude oil in December than a year earlier. The surge was the result of independent refiners rushing to exhaust their import quotas before the end of the year. The rush pushed the daily rate of shipments to 10.31 million bpd. That’s the second month in a row when Chinese refiners imported more than 10 million bpd of crude oil, with the December figure slightly below the record-high November import rate.The run rates of Chinese refineries are seen to continue rising this year as well, Reuters reports, citing forecasts from the research division of state oil and gas giant CNPC. CNPC’s analysts expect run rates at 4.7 percent higher than the 2018 average, at 12.68 million barrels daily.



Imports are also likely to continue growing in the face of the latest domestic production numbers: in 2018, production from local fields fell for the third straight year due to natural depletion, higher costs, and the absence of new discoveries.Natural gas production, on the other hand, is rising fast, breaking a record in December by reaching 15.3 billion cubic meters. That was 10 percent more than a year ago and substantially higher than the previous record, set a month earlier, in November, at 14.27 billion cubic meters. The total natural gas production in China in 2018 was 7.5 percent higher than a year earlier, at 161 billion cubic meters.

A gasoline pipeline in central Mexico that exploded on Friday has killed more than 80 people to date, media report. The initial death toll was a lot lower, but the latest update from the Wall Street Journal pegs the number of casualties at 85.The pipeline, owned and operated by state energy giant Pemex, was breached by fuel thieves, and at the time of the explosion a lot of people were gathered around it to take home some “free fuel.” Unfortunately, the free fuel came at a very high cost when a leak in the breached pipeline caused a blast.



“What happened here should serve as an example for the whole nation to unite behind the fight that the president is carrying out against this ill,” the local municipal health director Jorge Aguilar Lopez said, as quoted by Global News. However, in a country with the poverty levels of Mexico, “free fuel” is appealing. In 2017, the Pena Nieto government hiked prices at the pump by a fifth, sparking widespread protests.Yet the tragedy highlights the popularity of fuel theft that president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador vowed to fight with radical means if necessary. In late December, Mexico’s military took control over 58 key fuel installations in the country, including refineries, upon orders by the new president.



According to Pemex’s own estimates, the losses from fuel theft over the past three years have reached US$7.5 billion (147 billion Mexican pesos). A lot of the theft is conducted by gangs who are quick to resort to violence as they fight among themselves for greater access to state fuels and also engage in extortion of oil workers. According to Lopez Obrador, authorities are also involved in widespread fuel theft.The crackdown on fuel theft has been quick and it has had one important side effect: a fuel shortage at retail stations as Pemex closes pipelines and switches to fuel trucks. This caused in some cases lengthy delays in fuel deliveries, with the shortages even reaching the capital of the country, Mexico City.

Chinese independent refiners—commonly known as teapots—are not expected to be heavily impacted by restrictions on production, blending, and sales of oil products that the Shandong province, home to most independent refiners, released this week, sources at the companies tell S&P Global Platts.Earlier this week, the provincial government of Shandong issued a list reiterating restrictions in the oil products sector and mandated provincial authorities to start random checks for compliance with regulations such as refiners to operate under their respective licenses and produce fuels meeting standards.Refiners don’t see a major impact from the restrictions, also because they are not too specific.



“The wording was severe but the content was too general, leaving a wide gray area. We cannot assess the impact until we know how the government plans to monitor and punish those breaking rules,” a refiner based in Dongying told Platts.While it says that fuel standards have to be met by refiners, the Shandong government’s list of restrictions doesn’t specify any provincial or national standards, nor does it explicitly say which products are restricted or banned.  According to data from Chinese information provider JLC, quoted by Platts, independent refiners in the Shandong province ran their refineries at an average rate of 65.7 percent in the fourth quarter last year. This compares to an average run rate of 59.5 percent in the third quarter of 2018, and with a 66.6-percent run rate in the fourth quarter of 2017.



Independent refiners contributed a lot to China’s 30-percent jump in crude oil imports in December compared to a year earlier. The surge was the result of independent refiners rushing to exhaust their import quotas before the end of the year. This pushed the daily rate of shipments into China to 10.31 million bpd.

Eastern Libyan forces, who launched earlier this week a military operation in Libya’s south to fight extremists and secure oil facilities, have killed a senior operative for Al Qaeda, a spokesman for the eastern Libyan forces said on Friday.The Libyan National Army (LNA)—based in the eastern city of Benghazi and led by eastern strongman General Khalifa Haftar—killed Abu Talha al-Libi, a commander in Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) and two other militants, including one Egyptian, Reuters quoted LNA spokesman Ahmed Mismari as saying on Friday.Libya’s southwest, where the senior Al Qaeda commander was killed, is being used by extremists to launch attacks in the country and in the neighboring countries in North Africa. The same area is also home to the largest oil field in Libya, Sharara, which has been closed since early December, due to security breaches by armed groups.



On Tuesday, the LNA said that they had started a military operation to secure oil sites and facilities in Libya’s south, where Sharara is located.Sharara’s shutdown will result in daily production losses of 315,000 bpd, plus a loss of 73,000 bpd at the El Feel oil field because it depends on Sharara for electricity supply, Libya’s internationally recognized National Oil Corporation (NOC) said last month, noting that the “combined daily cost to the Libyan economy of this unnecessary shutdown” is US$32.5 million.Related: Low Oil Prices Are Not The Only Problem For The PermianAccording to NOC, “Oil production will now only restart at Sharara after alternative security arrangements are put in place.”



Libya’s crude oil production and exports have been severely disrupted since early December due to port closures courtesy of bad weather as well as security incidents and issues at Sharara.As a result, Libya’s crude oil production in December plunged by 172,000 bpd from November—to 928,000 bpd from 1.1 million bpd, according to OPEC’s secondary sources in the cartel’s Monthly Oil Market Report released on Thursday. The drop in Libya’s oil production last month was the second steepest decline among OPEC producers after Saudi Arabia, which cut production by 468,000 bpd from November to 10.553 million bpd in December.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:What’s Behind Oil’s Slow Flash Crash?U.S. Oil Outlook Slammed By Lower PricesOil May Never Return To The Triple-Digits

Tesla said on Friday that it would reduce full-time employee headcount by around 7 percent, aiming to cut costs as it looks to start delivering lower-priced variants of its Model 3.According to the BBC, Tesla employs more than 45,000 people, so the announced job cuts would affect around 3,000 employees.Last year was Tesla’s most challenging, and at the same time most successful, year in its history, Elon Musk wrote in an email sent to all Tesla employees on Friday morning.“However, starting around May, we will need to deliver at least the mid-range Model 3 variant in all markets, as we need to reach more customers who can afford our vehicles. Moreover, we need to continue making progress towards lower priced variants of Model 3,” Musk wrote.



Currently, the most affordable Tesla offering is the mid-range 264-mile Model 3 with premium sound and interior at $44,000. The need for lower-priced variants will become gradually greater this year as the U.S. tax credit drops in half on July 1, and as it goes away entirely at end-2019, Musk said. “As a result of the above, we unfortunately have no choice but to reduce full-time employee headcount by approximately 7% (we grew by 30% last year, which is more than we can support) and retain only the most critical temps and contractors,” Musk wrote.“Higher volume and manufacturing design improvements are crucial for Tesla to achieve the economies of scale required to manufacture the standard range (220 mile), standard interior Model 3 at $35k and still be a viable company. There isn’t any other way,” he said.Related: Low Oil Prices Are Not The Only Problem For The PermianIn the email, Musk also provided some guidance on Tesla’s Q4 financial performance, saying that the company made a GAAP profit again in Q4, but smaller than the Q3 profit, which Musk considers “our first meaningful profit in the 15 years since we created Tesla.” 



“This quarter, as with Q3, shipment of higher priced Model 3 variants (this time to Europe and Asia) will hopefully allow us, with great difficulty, effort and some luck, to target a tiny profit,” Musk added.Following the news, Tesla’s shares plummeted more than 5 percent on NASDAQ in pre-market trade.The announcement of job cuts is not as bad news as the market interprets it to be, according to some analysts.“Reducing headcount also suggests productivity gains,” CNBC quoted Jefferies analyst Philippe Houchois as writing in a note to investors on Friday.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:What’s Behind Oil’s Slow Flash Crash?Low Oil Prices Are Not The Only Problem For The PermianSolar Investment Plunges Amid Panel Glut

Saudi Arabia plans to build an oil refinery that would use Saudi crude, as well as a petrochemical plant in South Africa, as part of US$10 billion investments, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said on Friday while on a visit to South Africa.Saudi oil giant Saudi Aramco will lead the construction of the oil refinery in South Africa, al-Falih noted.“There have been exchanges of talks by Saudi Aramco teams and they have been supported by the South African energy ministry,” Reuters quoted the Saudi minister as saying after a meeting with South Africa’s Energy Minister Jeff Radebe.



“The Republic of South Africa and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia concluded & signed a declaration of intent to cooperate comprehensively in the field of oil & gas,” Radebe tweeted on Friday.According to the South African minister, the two countries will finalize in the next few weeks details about the exact locations of the oil refinery and petrochemical plant.Al-Falih, for his part, noted that Saudi Arabia was interested in using the African country’s major oil storage facilities. In addition, Saudi Arabia’s utility developer ACWA Power is looking to invest in South Africa’s new renewable energy program.



In the summer of 2018, during the state visit of South Africa’s President Cyril Ramaphosa to Saudi Arabia, the Saudis pledged to invest US$10 billion in South Africa, predominantly in the energy sector.While Ramaphosa was on a visit to Saudi Arabia in July, the outlet Middle East Eye raised questions about the potential involvement of South Africa-made weapons in the conflict in Yemen.According to annual reports from South African National Conventional Arms Control Committee (NCACC), quoted by Middle East Eye, South Africa supplied arms, ammunition, armored vehicles, and surveillance and military technology to both Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in 2016 and 2017.

China’s largest crude oil refiner, Sinopec, has offered US$3 billion to Iran’s state oil company, NIOC, to jointly expand the development of a major field in Iran, the Wall Street Journal reports, citing sources in the know.The sources, who wished to remain unnamed, said the Chinese company considered the offer safe from the sanctions the United States reimposed on Iran last November because the initial deal for the development of the Yadavaran field was inked back in 2007.



The offer, according to the Wall Street Journal, was made last month but it is only now coming to light as media and analysts speculate whether Washington will extend the sanction waivers granted to eight Iranian oil importers will be extended beyond the original deadline.Three of the eight countries, meanwhile, have completely stopped buying Iranian oil: Taiwan, Italy, and Greece. However, these are not the biggest buyers of Iranian crude and some analysts believe the other five—China, India, South Korea, Japan, and Turkey—may be granted waiver extensions that are, however, bound to come at a cost.



Sinopec, along with the other Chinese state oil giant, CNPC, have already invested heavily in Iran’s oil industry as domestic production declines due to field depletion and the country’s growing oil hunger needs to be satisfied with imported crude.Yadavaran, as well as another field along Iran’s border with Iraq, are among the largest projects. Yadavaran holds an estimated 31 billion barrels of crude, which makes it one of the largest undeveloped fields in the world, and North Azadegan contains estimated reserves of 5.7 billion barrels.Sinopec has already invested US$2 billion in the development of Yadavaran, with production there standing at 115,000 bpd, while North Azadegan, operated by NIOC and CNPC, started production at a rate of 75,000 bpd two years ago.

China’s CNOOC will seek to boost its crude oil reserve base and increase the number of new exploration projects it is involved in twofold over the next seven years, Reuters reports, citing a statement by the company on Chinese network Wechat.CNOOC focuses on offshore oil and gas, and is the largest operator in this area in China and has recently been very active in its international expansion to offset production declines at mature Chinese fields. The announcement of the reserve and production boost plan comes in response to an urging from President Xi Jinping to enhance China’s national security.



“We faced adverse geological conditions as offshore oil and gas fields age. More exploration projects are being moved to deep water area, but these are both risky and costly,” CNOOC’s head of geology, Xie Yuhong, said.According to the chairman of the company, the reserve boost plan will require record-high investments in the next seven years. CNOOC is announcing its budget and production target for 2019 later this month.



Earlier this month, CNOOC announced, along with its partner Total, the start of production at the Egina deepwater field off the Nigerian coast, which is seen to reach its peak production as early as this year, at 200,000 bpd. The field went into production ahead of schedule, which suggests CNOOC is successfully pursuing its reserve boost plans already.At end-2017, the company had a net reserve base of 2.613 billion barrels of oil equivalent. According to Reuters, this was the highest reserve base level for CNOOC since 2008. Last year, CNOOC said it will boost its capital spending to US$10.3-US$11.8 billion (70-80 billion yuan), of which 51 percent would be spent domestically and the rest on international projects.Also in 2018, CNOOC said it planned to expand oil production from a planned 470-480 million barrels of oil equivalent in 2018 to 485 million barrels of oil equivalent this year, and 500 million barrels of oil equivalent in 2020.

The industry achieved a net production increase of 164 billion cubic metres (bcm), which represents the highest production growth since 2010, according to research by Rystad Energy.“Year-on-year growth was clearly driven by North America, which accounted for 71 bcm, followed by the Middle East with 39 bcm. Europe was the only region that experienced a reduction in 2018,” Rystad Energy partner Espen Erlingsen said.


Rystad Energy forecasts the supply surge will continue in the coming years. Expected average annual growth from 2018 to 2021 is 115 bcm, which would outpace the average annual growth from 2011 to 2017 by 90%.“Going forward, global growth will be driven primarily by North American gas, which is going through an LNG development phase,” Erlingsen added.Rystad Energy, the independent energy research and consulting firm headquartered in Norway with offices across the globe, expects that US gas production will reach almost 1,000 bcm per day (94 bcfd) by 2025.



The weakest global annual growth was observed in the 2015-2016 cycle, when global gas output grew by only 12 bcm. This was also the only period in which North America experienced a year-on-year reduction in gas production growth.By Rystad EnergyMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:U.S. Oil Outlook Slammed By Lower PricesOil May Never Return To The Triple-DigitsOffshore Spending To Overtake Shale In 2019

The United States is unlikely to entirely remove waivers for Iran sanctions it granted to eight large importers of the commodity in November, according to analysts, as quoted by Reuters.The countries most likely to receive waiver extensions are also the countries most in need of the oil supply they receive from Tehran: China, India, Japan, South Korea, and Turkey. Italy, Taiwan, and Greece, which were granted waivers in November, are smaller importers of Iranian crude.Earlier this week, Washington’s special representative for Iran, Brian Hook, said there were no plans to extend any waivers or grant more of them, the ultimate goal of the Trump administration remaining to bring Iranian crude oil exports down to zero. However, if analysts are to be believed, this is unrealistic.



“Other geopolitical priorities will moderate the administration’s desire to halt Iranian exports, particularly with Iran’s top two purchasers, China and India,” Eurasia Group analysts said, adding “The reductions will probably hit the Iranian economy hard especially because President Hassan Rouhani’s administration is planning its budget around unrealistically high expectations for oil revenue.”Related: What’s Behind Oil’s Slow Flash Crash?Tanker-tracking company Kpler noted this week in an update on Iranian oil flows that the country has suffered a decline in export-bound oil shipments after the announcement by President Trump he was pulling the U.S. out of the Iran nuclear deal, with that decline becoming particularly sharp ahead of the November sanctions.Iran is still exporting at rates of over 1 million bpd, despite the fact Japan and South Korea suspended all intake of Iranian crude—at least officially—before November. As of December, Kpler said, as much as 51 percent of Iranian oil cargos traveled off the radar, often leaving their final destination a secret by discharging their cargo to another ship.



What’s more, buyers are looking for and finding ways to circumvent the sanctions: India set up a mechanism using local banks and the local currency to pay for Iranian crude excluding dollars for the equation. China has used ways to avoid sanctions in its trade relations with Iran before and it has made clear it will use them again. It makes sense, then that Brian Hook said Washington will be looking to balance U.S. national security and economic interests when deciding how to proceed with the waivers.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:U.S. Oil Outlook Slammed By Lower PricesLow Oil Prices Are Not The Only Problem For The PermianSolar Investment Plunges Amid Panel Glut

Clean energy solutions are not moving fast enough to meet the UN targets for curbing the effects of global warming, and alternative energies are unlikely to meet those targets without policy support, Charles Holliday, the chairman of oil supermajor Shell, said on Thursday.“Our analysis says we could solve this problem with the technology we have, but there is not enough pull to get it over in the kind of time frame that the scientists say we really need to avoid that,” the Washington Examiner quoted Holliday as saying at an energy innovation forum in Washington D.C.



“Unless there is big policy action, which drives the technology, we’re just not going to get there,” Shell’s chairman said.Policymakers could incentivize companies like Shell to invest more in clean energy by keeping predictable and constant federal funding over a period of 10 years, Washington Examiner quoted Holliday as saying. Another incentive would be the creation of clean energy programs with federal funding and private sector investment, according to Holliday.



Last year, the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change issued a special report on the climate situation on the planet, saying that the world needs to spend US$2.4 trillion every year until 2035 if it were to slow down the effects of climate change.Shell, for its part, plans to double the annual amount of money it invests in renewable energy to US$4 billion, the supermajor’s head of gas and new energy, Maarten Wetselaar told The Guardian in an interview last month. The figure is double the maximum current annual investment Shell has allocated for cleaner energy initiatives but the increase will only materialize if these initial investments prove to make financial sense.Earlier in December, Shell said that it plans to set short-term emission reduction targets and link these targets with executive pay, yielding to growing investor pressure about establishing short-term emission goals.

OPEC has decided to hold an extraordinary full ministerial meeting on April 17 in Vienna to discuss the state of the oil market and the production cut deal, while the cartel’s non-OPEC partners will join for a full OPEC+ meeting on the following day, April 18, an OPEC official told S&P Global Platts on Thursday.  OPEC could still hold its regular full ministerial meeting in June, as it usually does, the official with the organization told Platts.



A month before the full ministerial meeting in the middle of April, representatives of both OPEC and non-OPEC producers part of the deal will discuss the oil market developments at the monitoring committee meeting.The date is yet to be finalized, but according to Platts’s source at OPEC, the monitoring committee will likely meet on March 17-18 in Baku, Azerbaijan, which is part of the non-OPEC group of allies participating in the production cut deal. The energy ministers of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Venezuela, and Algeria from OPEC and Russia and Oman from non-OPEC are part of the monitoring committee, while Azerbaijan will also take part as the host.



Announcing the new OPEC+ production deal, the cartel said in early December that the next OPEC/non-OPEC ministerial meeting would be held in April in Vienna, but no details about the date were revealed.Related: Trump Takes Aim At Maduro, Threatens Oil EmbargoIt would make sense for OPEC and allies to hold a full meeting in mid-April, considering that they could decide whether or not to extend the production cuts which currently expire in June. The other reason for a mid-April meeting would be that the U.S. waivers for eight Iranian oil customers expire in early May, and the U.S. Administration has not yet given a clear signal whether it would be extending some waivers or push for zero Iranian oil exports.Meanwhile, in its latest Monthly Oil Market Report published today, OPEC’s secondary sources—the ones the cartel uses to calculate compliance levels—showed that OPEC’s production declined by 751,000 bpd in December from November. The cartel’s total crude oil production dropped to 31.578 million bpd last month, from 32.328 million bpd in November.

Due to weather and geological conditions in the cold Russian winter, Russia cannot cut its oil production too quickly, Energy Minister Alexander Novak said on Thursday, reiterating Moscow's commitment to stick to the new OPEC+ deal and to gradually reduce production. Russia will try to cut its oil production faster, Novak noted.A few days ago, Khalid al-Falih, the energy minister of Saudi Arabia—the OPEC kingpin and key Russian ally in all OPEC/non-OPEC production policy deals since early 2017—said that Russia was moving with the cuts “slower than I’d like.”



“Russia has started, slower than I’d like, but they’ve started, and I am sure as they did as in 2017 they’ll catch up and be a positive contributor to re-balancing the market,” al-Falih told CNBC on Sunday.The new OPEC+ deal, under which Russia will be cutting 228,000 bpd, is for a six-month period starting January 1, 2019 with an option to review in April.Russian oil companies will reduce their production by that amount during the first quarter of 2019, Novak said after the agreement was reached in December.



Novak has said that Russia is planning to reduce its oil production by 50,000 bpd to 60,000 bpd in January as part of the new OPEC+ deal, and will not be cutting its 228,000-bpd share outright at the start of the agreement. Russia has already drafted a timetable for how much oil production it would reduce each month until it reaches its share of the OPEC/non-OPEC production cut, Novak said, reaffirming Moscow’s position that its reduction would be gradual, just like in the previous agreement between OPEC and the Russia-led non-OPEC partners.Last Friday, Novak said that Russia had already cut production by some 30,000 bpd compared with October—the baseline for the cuts—and still aimed to reach a cut of 50,000 bpd by the end of this month.Today, Novak told Russian news agency RIA Novosti that he would be meeting with al-Falih at the World Economic Forum in Davos next week to discuss joint projects, cooperation, and the implementation of the OPEC+ deal.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Russia Looks To Build ‘LNG Island’ To Supply Booming Asian MarketSolar Investment Plunges Amid Panel GlutOil Prices Lag Despite Early OPEC Cuts

U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry said on Thursday that the United States is launching a battery recycling research and development (R&D) center, aiming to reduce its reliance on foreign supply of critical minerals such as cobalt and lithium.“America’s dependence on foreign sources of critical materials undermines our energy security and national security,” Secretary Perry said in a statement.Together with the Battery Recycling R&D Center, the Department of Energy is also announcing the launch of a Lithium-Ion Battery Recycling Prize, whose goal is to develop technologies to profitably capture 90 percent of all lithium-based battery technologies in the United States. Currently, lithium-ion batteries are collected and recycled at a rate of less than 5 percent, according to the DOE.



The recycling contest will award cash prizes of a total of US$5.5 million to contestants who find innovative solutions to collecting, storing, and transporting discarded lithium-ion batteries for eventual recycling, the DOE said.The United States will invest US$15 million in a Lithium Battery R&D Recycling Center, which will work on cost-effective recycling processes to recover lithium battery materials. The Center will be led by Argonne National Laboratory along with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory and Oak Ridge National Laboratory.The purpose of the prize and R&D center will be to reclaim and recycle critical materials such as cobalt and lithium from lithium-based battery technology used in consumer electronics, defense, energy storage, and transportation applications.



“Critical materials such as lithium and cobalt are both expensive and dependent on foreign sources for production,” the DOE said.The Democratic Republic of the Congo is the world’s largest producer of cobalt and mines more than 60 percent of the cobalt globally. The African country has recently declared the mineral a “strategic” commodity and raised royalty rates for mining companies.The world’s biggest producers of lithium are Australia, Chile, and Argentina, according to the U.S. Geological Survey’s Mineral Commodity Summaries.

Libya reopened on Thursday all its oil loading terminals where operations were suspended for nearly a week due to inclement weather, S&P Global Platts reports, quoting a source close to the developments.Libya’s crude oil production and exports have been severely disrupted since early December due to previous port closures courtesy of bad weather as well as security incidents and issues at the country’s largest oil field Sharara, which has been shut in since December 8.As a result, Libya’s crude oil production in December plunged by 172,000 bpd from November—to 928,000 bpd from 1.1 million bpd, according to OPEC’s secondary sources in the cartel’s Monthly Oil Market Report released today. The drop in Libya’s oil production last month was the second steepest decline among OPEC producers after Saudi Arabia, which cut production by 468,000 bpd from November to 10.553 million bpd in December.



Libya’s oil ports were closed last Thursday due to bad weather, adding to the existing shut-in at Sharara and further disrupting Libyan oil exports.The African OPEC member had to suspend port operations in early December, saying the disruption would lead to a 150,000-bpd shut-in because storage tanks at oil terminals were close to full capacity.Over the past few weeks, Libya’s crude oil loadings have been delayed by between four and ten days, trading sources told Platts on Thursday. Related: Oil Markets Could See Deficit In 2019



Over the past year, Libya has recovered part of its oil production despite a huge port blockade in the summer of 2018 that basically shut in nearly all of its exports for weeks. The biggest oil field Sharara is currently under force majeure due to a blockade by tribesmen and members of the Petroleum Facilities Guard demanding payments to lift the blockade.Libya’s National Oil Corporation (NOC) produced an average of 1.107 million bpd in 2018, NOC’s chairman Mustafa Sanalla said earlier this month. Total revenues reached US$24.4 billion, the highest since 2013 and a 78-percent annual rise. If the security situation improves, Libya plans to pump 2.1 million bpd of crude oil by 2021, Sanalla said.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Heavy Crude: From Glut To ShortageOil May Never Return To The Triple-DigitsOffshore Spending To Overtake Shale In 2019

A truck leasing company has said Tesla had approached with an offer to test drive a new truck prototype whose initial version the luxury EV maker revealed last year.Electrek’s Fred Lambert reports the company, TCI Transportation, last year test drove the first Tesla truck, the Semi, and was now presented with a new version of the same truck, after it ordered 50 Semis earlier.“The new Tesla Semi Tractor Prototype is here at TCI today!! We had an awesome turn out and people were even given a test drive in it. What a great day for TCI and it’s customers!” the truck leasing company said in a tweet today.



The Tesla Semi has two versions, one with a range of 300 miles and one with a range of 500 miles. The price tags are, respectively, US$150,000 and US$180,000 but Musk, Lambert recalls, said Tesla was aiming for even higher ranges of up to 600 miles.The Semi is not yet in production. Last year, Musk said it was scheduled to begin mass production this year and no updates to this timeline have been announced.Related: Offshore Spending To Overtake Shale In 2019However, Lambert says the so-called new version of the Semi that TCI Transportation tweeted about is probably not exactly a new version but an updated, improved version of the original Semi showcased last year.



Trucks are not the only new addition to Tesla’s lineup. Late last year Musk tweeted about a pickup truck that’s also on the agenda, although it will probably be a while until we see it because another model, the Model Y, is higher up the priority list.Musk said Tesla might team up with Daimler on the pickup truck in order to bring it to markets sooner rather than later. Funnily enough, before the release of the Semi, Daimler’s head of trucks mocked the truck, telling Bloomberg, “If Tesla really delivers on this promise, we’ll obviously buy two trucks -- one to take apart and one to test because if that happens, something has passed us by. But for now, the same laws of physics apply.”   By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Global Automakers To Spend $300 Billion On EVs In 10 YearsCan The U.S. Keep Its Nuclear Industry Afloat?Oil Markets Could See Deficit In 2019

Continuously rising U.S. shale production will make the United States a net exporter of crude oil and petroleum products in the fourth quarter of 2020, the EIA said in its January Short-Term Energy Outlook (STEO), which offered a first glimpse into the administration’s forecasts for 2020.The EIA has estimated that U.S. crude oil production averaged 10.9 million bpd in 2018, rising by 1.6 million bpd from 2017 and reaching its highest level and seeing its largest volume growth on record. This year, America’s crude oil production is expected to average 12.1 million bpd in 2019, while crude production in 2020 is seen averaging 12.9 million bpd, with most of the growth coming from the Permian.“If the domestic and global forecasts are realized, crude oil production at these levels would allow the United States to maintain its status as the world’s leading crude oil producer in both years,” the EIA said.



Thanks to the booming domestic production, the U.S. net imports of crude oil and petroleum products have been diminishing in recent years. This doesn’t mean that the U.S. is not importing large volumes of crude and petroleum products; rather, it means that exports of crude oil and oil products are continuously rising.Related: Trump Takes Aim At Maduro, Threatens Oil EmbargoIn the week to November 30, 2018, the U.S. exported more crude oil and petroleum products than it imported for the first time in weekly data going back to 1991, the EIA has estimated.“However, the United States still imports more crude oil than it exports: in September 2018, the most recent monthly data, the United States imported 7.6 million b/d and exported 2.1 million b/d. U.S. exports of petroleum products have continued to increase, and in 2017, the United States was a net exporter of several petroleum products such as motor gasoline, distillate, hydrocarbon gas liquids, and jet fuel,” according to the EIA.



Last year, U.S. net imports of crude oil and petroleum product are estimated to have dropped to an average of 2.4 million bpd, from an average of 3.8 million bpd in 2017. Net imports are expected to continue to fall, to an average of 1.1 million bpd this year, and to less than 100,000 bpd in 2020. In the fourth quarter of 2020, the EIA forecasts the United States will be a net exporter of crude oil and petroleum products, by about 900,000 bpd.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Global Automakers To Spend $300 Billion On EVs In 10 YearsOffshore Spending To Overtake Shale In 2019Oil Markets Could See Deficit In 2019

Sixty percent of Canadians now feel that the country’s oil pipeline capacity has reached crisis levels, according to a new survey from the Angus Reed Institute.Pipeline takeaway capacity has bitten into Canada’s oil revenues as Canada’s Western Canadian Select benchmark price continues to trade at an uncomfortable discount.An astonishing 70% of all Canadians reported that the country will “face considerable impact if no new pipeline capacity is built, the new survey shows. And it’s not just residents from Canada’s oil-rich province of Alberta who deem pipeline constraints a national crisis; even in British Columbia, a province generally known for its strong environmental presence, 53% of residents feel it is a crisis. That’s low compared to the overwhelming majority—87%--of Alberta residents who feel that way.



The survey also reports that overall, residents feel that the oil and gas industry is the most critical industry to the country. The majority (53%) of residents surveyed support both the Trans Mountain and Energy East pipelines, while 19% oppose both pipelines.  About 61% of respondents support Trans Mountain.As for the government’s handling of its pipeline issues, 50% of those surveyed feel that the federal government, led by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, is doing too little to build new pipeline capacity, while 23% feel the federal government has had the right approach. 27% feel the federal government has overstepped.



While most of the provinces, with the exception of outlier Quebec, seem to have similar views of the pipeline crisis, there is an age-related disparity. 62% of those respondents 55 and older support both pipelines, while just 55% of those between the ages of 35-54 support both. Only 38% of those respondents between 18 and 34 support both, highlighting the divided between generations.The poll indicates that favor is rising for the much-debated Trans Mountain pipeline, with an April 2018 poll reporting 55% of those polled supported Trans Mountain. In February 2018, the same poll showed only a 49% approval rating for the Trans Mountain.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Another Crucial Canadian Pipeline Runs Into TroubleMiddle East Gas Game Accelerates As ENI Wins ConcessionsFears Of U.S. Shale Demise May Be Overblown

OMV, the operator of the northernmost oil discovery offshore Norway—Wisting in the Barents Sea—could begin production in 2026, the Senior Vice President of OMV’s Norwegian unit, Knut Mauseth, told Reuters on Wednesday, in what could be some relief for Norway’s oil industry amid current forecasts that production will decline from the mid-2020s in the absence of new major oil discoveries.Earlier this week, OMV said that the estimated recoverable volumes in the Wisting discovery had increased to 440 million barrels of oil in place, from 350 million barrels previously estimated.“Data from the latest appraisal well and the seismic data acquired have given us a better understanding of the area and the resources. We now see the increased potential of Wisting”, Mauseth said in a statement.Currently, OMV and partners are studying the option to produce oil from the discovery via a floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) unit. The final concept selection is expected in 2020, OMV said.



The development of Wisting will probably need investments of US$4.7 billion-US$5.8 billion (40 billion-50 billion Norwegian crowns), Mauseth told Norwegian industry outlet petro.no on Wednesday.  OMV is the operator with a 25-percent working interest in the production license where the Wisting discovery was made in 2013. The other shareholders are Norway’s Equinor with 35 percent and Petoro with 20 percent, as well as the Norwegian unit of Japanese petroleum firm Idemitsu with the remaining 20 percent.Related: Offshore Spending To Overtake Shale In 2019Speaking to Reuters on Wednesday, OMV’s Mauseth said that production at Wisting could begin in 2026.



According to the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate (NPD), production at Wisting is likely, but not yet clarified.In the Barents Sea, Snøhvit and Goliat are currently in production and then comes Equinor’s Johan Castberg, scheduled for first oil in 2022—this will lead to more infrastructure construction in the Barents Sea that could boost exploration in the area, Mauseth told petro.no.According to the NPD’s resource estimate, nearly two-thirds of the undiscovered resources on the Norwegian Continental Shelf lie in the Barents Sea. The industry and the oil regulator are concerned that Norway faces a decline in oil production from the mid-2020s unless major new oil discoveries are made.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Can The U.S. Keep Its Nuclear Industry Afloat?Oil Markets Could See Deficit In 2019Trump Takes Aim At Maduro, Threatens Oil Embargo

Iran is ready to sign a deal with Iraq to drop the bilateral customs tariffs to zero, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said while on a visit to Iraq on Wednesday.“The Islamic Republic of Iran is prepared to zero tariff rates between the two countries,” Iran’s Fars news agency quoted the foreign minister as saying.  According to Zarif, Iran exports US$2 billion worth of gas and electricity to Iraq every year, despite the U.S. sanctions on Iran.



The American sanctions on Iran have put Iraq in a tight spot—on the one hand, Baghdad’s trade is closely linked with its neighbor Iran, but on the other hand, the United States is an ally that helps with security.Iraq has said that it will comply with the U.S. sanctions on Iran, and just before the sanctions snapped back, Baghdad stopped trucking small volumes of crude oil from its northern Kirkuk oil field to Iran in exchange for Tehran delivering the same amount of its oil to Iraq’s southern ports.Late last year, the United States granted Iraq a 90-day extension to the initial 45-day waiver allowing Baghdad to continue imports of electricity from Iran after the U.S. sanctions on Tehran returned.



Major Iraqi power plants are dependent on Iranian natural gas supply, while Iraq also imports electricity from Iran, as Baghdad’s power generation is not enough to ensure domestic supply.Iraq has argued that it needs more time to find alternative sources of electricity supply, or it risks more and more power outages, which were one of the main reasons for protest rallies in the heart of Iraq’s oil region in the southern city of Basra in the summer of 2018.During his visit to Iraq this week, Zarif also hoped to hold talks with senior Iraqi officials to look at ways to further boost cooperation and trade, Fars news agency reports.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com: Global Automakers To Spend $300 Billion On EVs In 10 YearsOil Markets Could See Deficit In 2019Can The U.S. Keep Its Nuclear Industry Afloat?

Despite the fact that the U.S. is not looking to grant any waivers to Iranian oil customers when the current ones expire in early May, it shouldn’t be taken for granted that no waivers will be issued, according to the U.S. Special Representative for Iran, Brian Hook, and to analysts and an official with the previous U.S. Administration.“We did not want to lift the price of oil, and we were successful doing that.  So when the president left the deal it was trading at $74. When our sanctions went back into effect, and we had taken off a million barrels of Iranian crude, oil was at $72,” Hook said at Atlantic Council’s 2019 Global Energy Forum in Abu Dhabi on Saturday. “So we had very carefully calibrated the balancing of our national security goals and our economic interests. We did not – the president was very clear that he did not want to cause a spike in oil, and so we granted eight oil exceptions – significant reduction exceptions. All of those countries demonstrated significant reductions in their purchases of Iranian crude that made them eligible for an exception,” Hook said.



“We are not looking to grant any waivers or exceptions to the import of Iranian crude,” U.S. Special Representative for Iran said.However, asked about waivers, Hook replied “Well, I can’t preview that specifically.”  “All I can say is that we believe that a – that certainly when we have a better-supplied oil market then that puts us in a much better climate to accelerate the path to zero,” Hook noted.



While the U.S. Administration and many analysts believe that there will be a direct correlation between the U.S. Iran waivers policy and the price of oil at the time it has to decide, Amos Hochstein, the former international energy envoy who oversaw Iran sanctions under President Obama, told CNBC that “There will 100 percent be exemptions in May.”According to Hochstein, the U.S. granted exemptions because it was unable to reach agreements with some of Iran’s largest oil customers to stop importing oil from Tehran and the Administration probably doesn’t want to sanction countries that would continue imports.“The reason for that is if you don’t give an exemption and someone is importing, then you have to sanction them, and you probably don’t want to sanction them,” Hochstein told CNBC.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Global Automakers To Spend $300 Billion On EVs In 10 YearsCrude Oil Inventory Draw Fails To Move MarketOil Markets Could See Deficit In 2019

Chevron Corporation has temporarily suspended train 3 of its Gorgon liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant in Australia—a development expected to boost Asian LNG prices that hit an eight-month low last week.Chevron halted the third train at Gorgon to fix a mechanical issue, and the cause is currently being investigated, a Chevron spokesman told Reuters on Wednesday.The other two trains at Gorgon are operating regularly and they continue to produce LNG and load cargoes, the spokesman noted.



According to LNG traders and industry sources who spoke to Reuters, the temporary suspension of train 3 is set to boost Asian LNG prices, which last week hit their lowest in eight months and are at their lowest for this time of the winter season in the northern hemisphere in at least two years.At the end of last week, Asian LNG spot prices for February delivery slipped to $8.50 per million British thermal units (mmBtu)—the lowest since the middle of May 2018, as milder winter weather in Japan and parts of China had depressed spot LNG cargo demand in the region. In addition, stock levels of LNG in China are quite high, so the Chinese will not rush to procure spot cargoes at least until the Lunar New Year holiday in early February, traders told Reuters last Friday.Referring to the cause of the Gorgon outage, some industry sources say that the mechanical issue at the suspended train 3 could have been caused by the current heat wave in Australia in the southern hemisphere summer.



“The past 4 days are in Australia's top 10 warmest days on record,” Australia’s Bureau of Meteorology tweeted on Tuesday.Chevron’s three-train Gorgon project, which has the capacity to produce 15.6 million tons of LNG per year, sent its first LNG cargo in March 2016.In April 2018, Chevron said that it would proceed with more offshore development at Gorgon. The expansion will involve drilling of 11 new wells in the Gorgon and Jansz-Io fields offshore Australia, with drilling set to begin this year.  By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Oil Rises After Choppy Start To The WeekFears Of U.S. Shale Demise May Be OverblownCME To Start Selling U.S. Export Crude

Total and Chevron have joined the Vakt blockchain-based trading platform that BP and Shell launched last year, Reuters reports, adding that India’s refining giant Reliance Industries also signed up for the platform.News of the platform first emerged in 2017 as blockchain continued to gain popularity. The consortium behind Vakt also includes trading houses Gunvor and Mercuria, as well as Koch Supply & Trading. The platform was financially backed by Dutch ABN Amro, ING, and French Societe Generale. The consortium behind Vakt announced the launch of the platform in November last year.



Big Oil has been eager to embrace the digital age now that the financial and efficiency benefits that some solutions can offer have become obvious. Blockchain specifically, despite the hype, has been adopted by a growing number of companies outside the narrow blockchain and cryptocurrency sector in a bid to make various transactions more secure.“Total has been supporting industry initiatives to digitise cargo post-trade processes for some time,” the French company’s chief of trading and shipping, Thomas Waymel said in a statement cited by Reuters. “We view them as a major step forward towards safer, faster and cheaper logistical operations. We are committed to contribute to the roll out to various markets of the VAKT blockchain platform.”



At the launch of Vakt, the consortium behind it said that initially, the platform will only process contracts for the five crude oil grades sourced from the North Sea that form the Brent international benchmark. At a later stage, it will include U.S. oil pipelines and cargoes of gasoline and other oil products for Northern Europe, which explains Total’s and Chevron’s early entry.Besides the four Big Oil companies, the consortium behind Vakt also includes Norway’s Equinor and trading giants Mercuria and Gunvor. Soon, the platform will be made available to non-members of the consortium, according to an S&P Global Platts report from November quoting Lyon Hardgrave, VP of business development at Vakt.By Irina Slav for Safehaven.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Fears Of U.S. Shale Demise May Be OverblownCME To Start Selling U.S. Export CrudeCrude Oil Inventory Draw Fails To Move Market

The carbon footprint of British Columbia is growing and has been growing for the last eight years despite a strong environmentalist lobby,  , the latest provincial government data suggests. The Global and Mail quotes a spokesman for the Ministry of Environment as saying British Columbia has fallen off the rails leading to the achievement of its carbon emission reduction target for 2030.The reason for this failure has, however, nothing to do with the oil industry as such. It’s simply a question of more people driving more cars.



“We’re still living in a fossil-fuel-based economy, and we’ve experienced economic and population growth,” the Globe and Mail quoted a Simon Fraser University researcher, Mark Jaccard, as saying. “More people are driving more cars, and unless we make a significant leap towards electric vehicles, these emissions will continue to rise.”British Columbia had a target of cutting carbon emissions by 33 percent from 2007 levels to 2020. However, the new figures reveal the province has only succeeded in cutting emissions by 2.2 percent from 2007 levels, which means the 2020 target will be pretty much unattainable unless a radical change in driving habits takes place.Related: Russia’s Looks To Build ‘LNG Island’ To Supply Booming Asian Market



Now, the British Columbia has a new target of reducing emissions by 40 percent from 2007 levels by 2030. That’s what the CleanBC plan devised by the new NDP government that came into office in 2017 envisages. According to Premier John Horgan, CleanBC includes steps to reduce emissions by 75 percent of the target amount by 2030 by encouraging a switch to more electric vehicles, greater use of renewable sources of energy and a pledge that by 2040 all new cars sold in the province will be zero-emission vehicles.B.C.’s shift to cleaner energy has pitted the province against neighbor Alberta, which produces most of Canada’s oil and supplies B.C. with natural gas. British Columbians have been protesting the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion on pollution concern grounds and the government has joined in, stopping the project.Now, B.C. residents are protesting a gas pipeline to a future project that the Horgan government is supporting: LNG Canada. The latest figures about emissions could intensify the environmental protests against the project, which the NDP government welcomed with open arms as the biggest single private investment in the province.

The American Petroleum Institute (API) reported a crude oil inventory draw of 650,000 barrels for the week ending Jan 11, compared to analyst expectations that we would see a draw in crude oil inventories of at least 2.5 million barrels.Last week, the API reported a surprise crude draw of 6.127 million barrels. A day later, the EIA showed that inventories had drawn down 1.7 million barrels from the previous week.Leading up to today’s data release from the API, crude oil prices were trading up on the day after a rough start to the week, as traders strengthening faith in OPEC and its allies that it will do whatever it takes to keep the markets balanced, and in a de-escalation of the trade war between China and the United States.  At 1:41pm EST on Tuesday, WTI was trading up on the day $1.32 (+2.61%) per barrel at $51.83—a rise of more than $2 since the last API report. Brent crude was trading up $1.33 (+2.25%) at $60.32—a near $2 increase from this time last week.  



Inventories in the Cushing, Oklahoma facility this week fell by 796,000 barrels.The API this week reported another large build in gasoline inventories for week ending January 11 in the amount of 5.99 million barrels.US crude oil production as estimated by the Energy Information Administration showed that production for the week ending January 4—the latest information available--stayed at 11.7 million bpd for the third week in a row.Distillate inventories increased this week by 3.214 million barrels, much less than last week’s 10+ million barrels build



The U.S. Energy Information Administration report on crude oil inventories is due to be released on Wednesday at 10:30a.m. EST.By 5:11pm CST, WTI was trading up at $52.07 and Brent was trading up at $60.60.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Is This The Answer To Canada’s Oil Crisis?U.S. Army Joins Race To Expand U.S. Oil ExportsWhy 2019 Will Be A Record Breaking Year For LNG

Although Tesla is not present at the 2019 North American International Auto Show in Detroit this year, Elon Musk has been awarded the ‘Disruptor of the Year’ Award at the CNET Roadshow Shift Awards.Musk won the award over the other two nominees—Mike Flewitt, CEO of McLaren Automotive, and Travis Vandenzanden, CEO of scooter company Bird.No Tesla, however, won in the vehicle categories in the CNET Roadshow Shift Awards. Tesla was nominated for Safety Tech of the Year for its Navigate on Autopilot update 9.0. The winner was Audi for its Drive Assistance Package with zFAS and lidar. In the Driveline Tech of the Year category, Tesla was nominated for its all-wheel drive Performance powertrain. The winner was Nissan/Infiniti for its VC-Turbo variable compression.



The Disruptor of the Year award “is all about pushing the industry forward and leaving a lasting impact on the future of the automotive industry. Elon Musk fits that bill to a T. After smoothing out its production process, Tesla once again proved profitable. The Model 3 quickly launched itself to prominence in an already busy segment, and buyers themselves could feel the effects of those launches thanks to its wild Performance variant. Hell, he even made tunnels interesting,” wrote Roadshow Editor in Chief Tim Stevens.“He of course couldn’t be with us today,” Stevens told Mlive speaking about Musk. “He’s somewhere between here and Mars right now.” “We’re not necessarily judging tremendous accomplishments,” Chris Paukert, executive editor of Roadshow, told Mlive. “We’re just looking at who stirred the pot the most this year.”Related: Fears Of U.S. Shale Demise May Be Overblown



Musk really stirred the pot the most over the past year. As he was working hard to ensure the ramping up of Model 3 production, he increased his Twitter activity, saying in early August that he would take Tesla private “funding secured”, only to backtrack on that proposal two weeks later.The tweet secured Musk an investigation from the SEC, which later charged Tesla’s CEO with securities fraud. Musk and the SEC quickly settled the charge days after the commission charged him. Last year, Musk also snubbed analysts on one conference call, saying their questions were ‘boring’, and appeared on a live video interview during which he smoked marijuana.At the end of the year, Tesla’s vehicle deliveries for Q4 2018 hit a record high as the EV maker delivered 90,700 vehicles in the last quarter of 2018, more than all the cars it delivered to clients in 2017.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.com  More Top Reads From Oilprice.com:There’s No Sugarcoating Canada’s Oil CrisisCME To Start Selling U.S. Export CrudeFears Of U.S. Shale Demise May Be Overblown

Three U.S. crude oil cargoes are currently headed to China in what could be the first Chinese purchase of American crude since the trade war escalated last summer and since the ‘trade-war truce’ of three months began in December, Reuters reported on Tuesday, quoting ship brokers and tanker-tracking data.Although crude oil is not on China’s tariff list, Chinese buyers have been staying away from U.S. crude oil purchases since the summer of 2018, when the trade war escalated.According to EIA data, the United States didn’t export any crude oil to China in August, September, and October, compared to 384,000 bpd in July and a record-high 510,000 bpd in June.



After the United States and China called a trade-war truce in early December and pledged to immediately begin trade negotiations in view of possible deal within 90 days, Chinese refiners are said to have started to look for opportunities to buy U.S. crude oil until March 1, when the negotiating period expires.According to ship brokers who spoke to Reuters and to Refinitiv Eikon vessel tracking data, three cargoes left Galveston, Texas, in December and are currently heading to China. One tanker is expected to arrive in China late in January and two others are planned to arrive in late February or early March, although the final destinations could change.  Related: Oil Rises After Choppy Start To The WeekAs of mid-December, cargo loading plans of Chinese refiners showed that appetite for U.S. crude in China continued to be weak, despite the trade-war truce. Rising freight costs for U.S. crude and the uncertainty over how the U.S.-China trade negations would unfold were the top considerations of the buyers, a Chinese analyst told Reuters last month.



Unipec, the trading arm of Chinese state oil major Sinopec and China’s largest buyer of U.S. crude oil until recently, is set to resume purchases from the United States “very soon,” and volumes are likely to be significant, a senior Unipec executive told S&P Global Platts in mid-December.China may have shunned U.S. crude oil since the summer, but the U.S. boosted shipments to other destinations. EIA data shows that American crude oil exports in October—the latest available monthly data—set a record high of 2.326 million bpd.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Another Crucial Canadian Pipeline Runs Into TroubleMiddle East Gas Game Accelerates As ENI Wins ConcessionsFears Of U.S. Shale Demise May Be Overblown

Saudi Arabia is discussing the possibility to have one interconnected natural gas grid in the region that would exchange gas and export the Kingdom’s gas to the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Kuwait, and Oman, Saudi Arabia’s Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said on Tuesday.“I am talking to my colleagues in Oman, Kuwait, UAE, about extending a gas grid in the region and we hope to exchange gas and we also have excess of gas which we will be exporting,” Gulf News quoted al-Falih as saying at the World Future Energy summit in Abu Dhabi.As Saudi Arabia aims to develop more of its natural gas resources, it will seek to export more of its gas to its allies in the region.



“We’ve already exported gas on a commercial basis to the UAE so more of this interconnection in energy is going to take place and, importantly, also in trading of knowhow in technology and development with renewables,” al-Falih was quoted as saying.The UAE is currently importing gas from Qatar via the Dolphin gas pipeline, which continued operations even after the UAE and Saudi Arabia, alongside Egypt and Bahrain, severed ties with Qatar in June 2017, accusing Doha of sponsoring terrorism.The tiny country Qatar, which is the world’s largest liquefied natural gas (LNG) exporter but a relatively small crude oil producer, said last month that it was leaving OPEC effective January 1, 2019, as part of a strategic plan to focus on its gas reserves and development.



Saudi Arabia, for its part, has identified a lot of gas reserves and will be developing them, aiming to eliminate the burning of crude oil and liquids at utilities—currently a typical power plant fuel in the Kingdom—by 2030, in order to free up more crude oil for exports, Gulf News quoted minister al-Falih as saying.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Oil Enters Bull Market As Shorts Are Wiped OutColombia’s Oil Rebound Off To A Rough Start In 2019Darkening Outlook For Global Economy Threatens Crude

Norway’s exclusive right to explore for oil and gas in parts of its continental shelf are at stake in a fascinating Supreme Court case focused on a marine species: the snow crab, Reuters reports.The Supreme Court of Norway today began hearing arguments for and against the right of European fishing vessels to enter the waters around several Norwegian Arctic islands to fish for snow crab, which is considered a delicacy in Japan and South Korea.However, the decision of the court would have direct implications for Norwegian and European oil and gas exploration in the area.



“The question of the snow crab is a proxy for oil. Because what is valid for the snow crab is valid for the oil industry,” a legal expert, Oeystein Jensen, told Reuters.The argument comes down to whether the snow crab is a sedentary species, which would mean it lives exclusively in Norwegian waters, securing an equally excusive right to only local fishermen to fish it, or a species that moves around, which would justify granting the same fishing right to fishermen from other European countries.The same, apparently, applies for oil and gas exploration as well, not because oil and gas are a moving marine species but probably because, like the snow crab, they are natural resources.



The Supreme Court case is related to a lower court ruling that Norway was right in convicting a boat owner of illegal fishing of the coast of the Svalbard archipelago, Reuters recalls. The owner, Latvian Peteris Pildegovics appealed that ruling, arguing that he didn’t need a Norwegian fishing license for the area, which Norway has controlled since 1920. Norway, for its part, has argued it has the sole power to issue fishing licenses for Svalbard.The court will hear arguments for three days before it renders a decision on who is right and who is wrong. Norway is not a member of the European Union, hence its argument that fishing licenses issued by the EU are invalid in Norwegian waters.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:There’s No Sugarcoating Canada’s Oil CrisisFears Of U.S. Shale Demise May Be OverblownCME To Start Selling U.S. Export Crude

A global recession is a possibility but it will hardly have a serious effect on the economy, Saudi Arabia’s top oil man, Khalid al-Falih, said at the Future Sustainability Summit taking place this week in Abu Dhabi.""A lot of resilience has been built into the global economy through regulatory systems. Companies and governments have built better fiscal positions,"" Al-Falih said as quoted by S&P Global Platts, adding ""I'm not ruling out a cyclical recession, and there will be one sooner or later, but I don't see it as a big shock to the global economy and I don't see it spilling over into the global economy.""



Talk about the possibility of the world’s economy slipping into a recession this year has been intensifying over the last couple of months, with speculation about the United States and Germany in particular. This led Bank of America Merrill Lynch to issue an updated forecast for oil prices, noting that Brent could slide down to US$35 a barrel if the recession scenario materialized.Al-Falih, however, is not worried. He noted that oil demand will remain robust this year and that any negative impact of an economic slowdown or even recession would be short-lived. The official also said OPEC is ready to deepen its production cuts should the need arise, to make sure whatever happens to the global economy does not result in a stronger effect on oil prices.



""On the supply side, we are vigilant to take appropriate response if there is an impact on demand,"" he said. ""If you look at the OPEC+ group, our combined production is close to 52 million. Adjusting by 5% does not appear to be a challenge.""Al-Falih’s cool extends to renewables as well. The official told media he was not worried about renewables encroaching on oil territory, noting that efforts to tackle climate change needed to be focused on “managing carbon emissions, not promoting one energy source over another."" He added that renewables were only a threat to coal, which they would displace in power generation, but not to oil. By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:There’s No Sugarcoating Canada’s Oil CrisisSaudi Oil Minister: No Need For Extraordinary OPEC MeetingCME To Start Selling U.S. Export Crude

""Albertans still need the federal government to step up and support the industry while we are trying to get through this ridiculousness of having not enough capacity to get our oil and gas to market,"" Alberta’s Premier, Rachel Notley, told media, in the latest sign of the growing exasperation in Canada’s oil province regarding the only oil pipeline the federal government of Justin Trudeau has approved since it came into office.The Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project, however, ran into serious difficulties as environmentalists and the new British Columbian government, which came into power in 2017, firmly opposed it and continue to oppose it, turning to the courts to delay the project’s final approval.



Last year, the federal government bought the project from Kinder Morgan, which made it clear it was unwilling to wait around forever until all regulatory and legal hurdles were cleared in the absence of certainty this would ever happen. Canada’s parliament was outraged by the US$4.5-billion move even though Trudeau’s cabinet has shown its support for Trans Mountain on numerous occasions. This, however, has not been enough.The latest episode in the saga concerns a project review that the National Energy Board needs to complete and submit to the Federal Appeals Court of Canada by February 22. The review was prompted by an Appeals Court decision to cancel NEB’s approval of the Trans Mountain expansion on the grounds of insufficient consultations with First Nations.



In the meantime, Albertan companies are producing oil that is being stored because all pipelines are full and so are trains. As a temporary measure, Notley announced late last year Alberta will buy additional oil train capacity of 120,000 bpd, acknowledging this would not solve the pipeline capacity problem.However, Notley is not blaming it all on Trudeau’s government. ""The facts of the matter is that the previous government, which happened to be from a different political party, also didn't get it done,"" the Albertan Premier said.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Fears Of U.S. Shale Demise May Be OverblownGlobal Automakers To Spend $300 Billion On EVs In 10 YearsOil Majors Bet Big On Offshore Drilling In 2019

U.S. Ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell has sent a letter to several German companies, warning them that they could face sanctions if they continue to work on the Russia-led Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project.Germany is the end-point of the highly controversial Gazprom-led Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which will follow the existing Nord Stream natural gas pipeline between Russia and Germany via the Baltic Sea. The U.S. opposes the project, as do EU institutions and some EU members such as Poland and Lithuania. Germany, however, supports Nord Stream 2 and sees the project as a private commercial venture that will help it to meet rising natural gas demand.Several European companies—ENGIE, OMV, Shell, as well as Germany’s Uniper and Wintershall—are partners of Russia’s gas giant Gazprom in the Nord Stream 2 project.  



Germany’s mass-circulation newspaper Bild am Sonntag first reported that Ambassador Grenell had sent letters to German companies warning them of potential sanctions, and used wording such as “Grennel was trying to blackmail” the German firms.Speaking to Reuters, the spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Berlin said that “The only thing that could be considered blackmail in this situation would be the Kremlin having leverage over future gas supplies.”The letter of the Ambassador, which had been coordinated by U.S. government agencies in Washington, “is not meant to be a threat but a clear message of U.S. policy”, the U.S. Embassy spokesman told Reuters. 



“The letter reminds that any company operating in the Russian energy export pipeline sector is in danger under CAATSA of U.S. sanctions,” the spokesman said.  The news of the letter irritated many German diplomats and politicians, some of whom have always insisted that the U.S. shouldn’t meddle in Germany’s affairs.Before news of the U.S. Ambassador’s letter broke, German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said last week that sanctions against Nord Stream 2 would be the wrong way to solve the energy supply disputes and issues. According to Maas, European energy policy issues should be decided in Europe, not in the United States.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Italy Looks To Block Oil, Gas Exploration PermitsChevron And Occidental Join Bill Gates-Backed Tech CompanyChina’s Slowing Economic Growth Could Wreak Havoc On Oil Markets

In a bid to boost the liquidity of the Brent international crude oil benchmark, S&P Global Platts plans to reform the way Dated Brent is being assessed as of November 2019 loadings, Platts said on Monday.S&P Global Platts proposes to reflect competitive offers of North Sea crude grades on a freight-adjusted cost, insurance and freight (CIF) Rotterdam basis in its free on board (FOB) Dated Brent crude oil benchmark for cargoes loading in November 2019 onwards.The key reason for planning to include CIF assessment is that FOB crude supply in the North Sea is gradually declining, Platts said.



“This proposal will allow the inclusion of more relevant market data in the benchmark on a daily basis, and ensure that every barrel of the grades currently reflected in Dated Brent is able to play the fullest possible role in establishing the value of North Sea crude,” according to Platts’ note.The proposal entails that “if a firm CIF Rotterdam offer for one of the five North Sea grades reflected in the Dated Brent assessment (Brent Ninian Blend, Forties, Oseberg, Ekofisk or Troll), after adjusting for freight and sailing time, is more competitive than a comparable bid for those grades on an FOB basis, then the CIF Rotterdam offer would take precedence in the final assessment of Dated Brent on the loading dates in question.”“A key part of our proactive stewardship of the benchmark is to continue to engage extensively to safeguard Dated Brent and ensure the benchmark evolves to remain robust, well supplied and relevant to all market participants. With FOB supply in the North Sea gradually falling, this proposal will ensure ample liquidity of grades in the Dated Brent basket for the foreseeable future,” Vera Blei, Global Director of Oil Market Reporting, S&P Global Platts, said in the statement.



The plan will not affect Platts methodology for assessing Cash Brent (BFOE) crude markets, it said.Platts is now seeking feedback by February 14, 2019 on the proposal, especially in terms of the planned timing of the assessment change, the freight adjustment factor for CIF offers, and details on vessel acceptance and previously loaded oil.By Tsvetana ParaskovaMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:China's Crude Imports Soared In DecemberChevron And Occidental Join Bill Gates-Backed Tech CompanyChina’s Slowing Economic Growth Could Wreak Havoc On Oil Markets

The top administrative court of the Netherlands will hear on Thursday two urgent requests to halt gas production at the giant Groningen field, but the ruling is not expected to be issued for another “few weeks” and will probably come at the end of this month, a spokeswoman for the court told S&P Global Platts on Monday.Groningen in the north of the Netherlands has been pumping gas for more than half a century and supplies gas to 98 percent of the Dutch population. But the field has been causing earthquakes that have become a growing concern for residents and authorities.After years of debates and measures to curb production at the field, the Dutch government decided in March last year that output at Groningen would be terminated by 2030, with a reduction by two-thirds until 2021-2022 and another cut after that. The authorities have already limited production from the field because of the earthquakes, but they decided last year that the risks and costs were no longer acceptable.



Production at Groningen has more than halved from a 2013 peak of 54 billion cubic meters, according to Platts. The Groningen production for this gas year—between October 2018 and September 2019—has been set at 19.4 Bcm, but a number of petitions and requests have been filed at court, including two emergency requests challenging this gas year’s cap of 19.4 Bcm and asking for production to be halted, awaiting a final decision.Related: Venezuela’s Crisis Threatens U.S. Control Over Oil Prices



“We expect the ruling will be given a few weeks after the hearing, so at the end of January,” the spokeswoman for the court told Platts today.Last week, the court said that it had received as many as 26 objections to the government’s plan for production reduction. Two emergency requests challenging this year’s output cap call for suspension of the production will be heard on Thursday, January 17. All the other objections will be heard in April this year, according to the court.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:How Supermajors Are Transforming The PermianBearish Bets On Diesel Tell A Worrying StoryOil Majors Bet Big On Offshore Drilling In 2019

OPEC plans to publish this week the quotas for individual countries under the new OPEC/non-OPEC production cut deal agreed upon on December 7 and in force since January 1, an OPEC source told Russian news agency TASS on Monday.  The publishing of the quotas for each country could help overcome the skepticism in the market regarding the resolve of OPEC and its allies to implement the decision made in early December, according to TASS’s source.During the current period of the cuts, until June 2019, OPEC and allies will remove a total of 1.195 million bpd off the market and keep production at 43.874 million bpd, according to TASS.



OPEC will shave off 812,000 bpd, while the non-OPEC countries part of the deal will reduce their combined production by 383,000 bpd to 17.937 million. Russia will cut production by 230,000 bpd to 11.191 million bpd, taking most of the non-OPEC cuts. Within OPEC, Saudi Arabia will be slashing production by 322,000 bpd to 10.31 million bpd, according to TASS. Reports that OPEC will publish individual country quotas first emerged in December, two weeks after the cartel and its allies decided to remove a combined 1.2 million bpd off the market in the first half of 2019 to stem the oil price rout and rebalance the market.Initial reports just after the meeting in Vienna in early December suggested that OPEC and its allies would not be unveiling who is cutting how much under the new deal.



But two weeks later, Reuters quoted OPEC’s Secretary General Mohammad Barkindo as saying in a letter:“In the interests of openness and transparency, and to support market sentiment and confidence, it is vital to make these production adjustments publicly available.”“I would urge Your Excellencies to kindly make positive announcements reinstating your countries’ commitment to implementing the agreed decisions. This is also vital to underpin trust in our decisions and to buttress ourselves from any naysayers who may doubt our commitment,” the letter obtained by Reuters says.By Tsvetana ParaskovaMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:China's Crude Imports Soared In DecemberChevron And Occidental Join Bill Gates-Backed Tech CompanyChina’s Slowing Economic Growth Could Wreak Havoc On Oil Markets

Zimbabwe is on a three-day nationwide strike and protests are erupting in the streets after the government of the southern African country doubled fuel prices, making gasoline sold in Zimbabwe the most expensive gasoline in the world.  Zimbabwe is in the midst of an economic crisis and a shortage of foreign exchange, which has led to fuel and bread shortages, and many companies have stopped working because they can’t import raw materials.Following hyperinflation in 2009, Zimbabwe abolished its own currency and has been using the U.S. dollar and South African rand instead.But the economic crisis and foreign currency shortages has prompted the government to say over the weekend that it would introduce a new currency of its own in the next 12 months.However, the policy that really sparked protests and calls for a national stay-away was the sharp increase of fuel prices over the weekend.



According to Zimbabwe’s President Emmerson Mnangagwa—who succeeded the president of 38 years Robert Mugabe in November 2017—the doubling of the fuel prices would help ease fuel shortages. In a post on his official Facebook page, Mnangagwa wrote on Sunday:“Following the current shortfall in the fuel market, we have chosen to act, and act decisively. The shortage, attributable to increased fuel usage in the growing economy, and compounded by rampant illegal currency and fuel trading activities, is unsustainable and Government has today decided on the following measures:A fuel pump price set at $3.11 per litre for diesel, and $3.33 per litre for petrol.”The gasoline price of $3.33 per liter is now the world’s highest.According to data from GlobalPetrolprices.com, as of January 7, 2019, the world’s average gasoline price was $1.08 per liter, or $4.09 per gallon. The most expensive gasoline in the world before the Zimbabwean price hike was in Hong Kong where a gallon of gas goes for $7.71.



In Zimbabwe, the trade unions and the main confederation of industries called for the three-day strike and say it has been a success so far.“So far the stay-away has been effective,” Peter Mutasa, president of the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions, told Bloomberg on the phone.The Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries said in a letter to the Industry Ministry that “The house is burning,” as many businesses are collapsing or on the verge of collapsing due to the lack of foreign exchange funds and economic chaos.By Tsvetana ParaskovaMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Mexico Hedges Oil at $55 A BarrelItaly Looks To Block Oil, Gas Exploration PermitsChevron And Occidental Join Bill Gates-Backed Tech Company

The United States has no intention of granting any further sanction waivers to Iran crude oil buyers, the U.S. special representative for Iran, Brian Hook, said this weekend, as quoted by Reuters, just as Iran’s top oil buyers Japan and South Korea restart their purchases of Iranian crude.Speaking on the sidelines of an oil industry conference in the UAE, Hook said “We are not looking to grant any waivers or exemptions to the import of Iranian crude,” adding “Iran is now increasingly feeling the economic isolation that our sanctions are imposing ... We do want to deny the regime revenues.”



In November, when the U.S. sanctions against Iran returned, the State Department announced sanction waivers for eight major Iranian oil importers, among them China, India, Japan, South Korea, Turkey, Taiwan, Italy, and Greece. However, Washington made it crystal clear these waivers were temporary and the eight countries were expected to reduce their intake of Iranian crude gradually to zero: the ultimate goal of the Trump administration with regard to Iran.Some of these importers, notably South Korea and Japan, reduced their Iranian oil imports to zero ahead of the sanctions’ entry into effect in a bid to maximize their chances of scoring a waiver. Now that these have been granted, these two countries, the closest U.S. allies in Asia, have still demonstrated reluctance to restart buying Iranian oil. Even so, both Japanese and South Korean officials and industry insiders have said there are plans to resume imports, albeit temporarily, this month or next.



China and India also reduced their intake of Iranian oil in the past few months but have not made a secret of their preference to continue buying Iranian crude even after the expiry of the waivers. India, in particular, even announced a payment settlement mechanism for Iranian oil that may allow it to avoid breaching the U.S. sanctions.By Irina SlavMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Saudi's Look To Meet Japan's Oil NeedsItaly Looks To Block Oil, Gas Exploration PermitsChevron And Occidental Join Bill Gates-Backed Tech Company

Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih discussed on Monday how Saudi Arabia could meet Japan’s petroleum requirements in a meeting with the Japanese minister for economy and trade.The two officials met in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) today, and al-Falih told reporters the issues they discussed included Japan’s energy security and how the Saudis could help Japanese oil needs.Japan, which imports almost all of the oil it consumes, was a regular customer of oil from Saudi Arabia’s regional archrival Iran, before the U.S. sanctions on Iran’s oil industry returned.As a close U.S. ally, Japan significantly slashed its oil imports from Iran before the sanctions snapped back on November 5, hoping to win a U.S. waiver to continue importing Iranian oil at reduced volumes until the waiver expires in early May 2019. Japan did get a waiver, together with seven other Iranian oil buyers, including the two biggest—China and India.



Japan wants to ensure enough energy security and will try to keep importing Iranian oil, but at the same time it doesn’t want to vex the U.S. Administration.“Even though Japan wants to preserve the JCPOA, it cannot afford to antagonize the US administration considering the current unstable security environment,” Sachi Sakanashi, a senior research fellow at the JIME Center, Institute of Energy Economics, Japan (IEEJ), wrote in a post on the Atlantic Council on Monday.Two Japanese refiners, JXTG and Cosmo Oil, plan to resume buying Iranian oil at the end of this month, their respective presidents told S&P Global Platts last week. “Various procedures” regarding the resumption of imports could push the loadings from January to February, Tsutomu Sugimori, the president of the parent company of Japan’s largest refiner, JXTG Nippon Oil & Energy, told Platts.  The president of the Petroleum Association of Japan (PAJ), Takashi Tsukioka, said last week that the industry would continue to call on the Japanese government to work on securing an extension to the U.S. waiver after it ends in May.



However, Japan’s efforts for waiver extension may fall on deaf ears. The U.S. Special Representative for Iran, Brian Hook, said over the weekend:“We are not looking to grant any waivers or exemptions to the import of Iranian crude.”By Tsvetana ParaskovaMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:China's Crude Imports Soared In DecemberChevron And Occidental Join Bill Gates-Backed Tech CompanyChina’s Slowing Economic Growth Could Wreak Havoc On Oil Markets

Saudi Aramco is on track to become a public company in 2021, Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said during an oil conference in Abu Dhabi.Gulf News quoted the official as saying Aramco was the world’s most important and most valuable oil company. “This bodes well for the company’s bond plans, which will be launched in a few months, ahead of the acquisition of Sabic shares from PIF [Public Investment Fund] and of course the IPO [which is] not too distant in the future.”



Al-Falih said earlier that Aramco was planning to issue its first international bond, probably worth around US$10 billion, to fund part of the acquisition of a majority stake in petrochemical giant Sabic from the Saudi sovereign wealth fund. The 70-percent stake was calculated at between US$50 and US$70 billion.Last year, media reported that Aramco was planning a US$40-billion bond sale to fund the acquisition that would expand its presence in petrochemicals, but it dropped this plan. The Wall Street Journal reported in November that the oil major had been concerned about requirements for disclosure as well as the volatility and uncertain outlook for oil prices, according to unnamed sources familiar with the developments.



The smaller bond Al-Falih talked about in Abu Dhabi, likely to take place in the second quarter of the year, would also require the company to make its accounts public for the first time since its nationalization back in the 1970s. It will also have to divulge details about its reserves and operations.Recently, a third-party reserve audit by DeGolyer and MacNaughton found that Aramco had reserves of 263.1 billion barrels, a bit over 2 billion barrels more than the company has been reporting for years. This should be good news for potential investors, but they will need the company’s accounts, too, before they decide to buy its bond.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Mexico Hedges Oil at $55 A BarrelItaly Looks To Block Oil, Gas Exploration PermitsChevron And Occidental Join Bill Gates-Backed Tech Company

U.S. consumer prices inched down by 0.1 percent in December, due to a sharp decline in gasoline futures, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics said on Friday, reporting the first drop in consumer prices in nine months.The Consumer Price Index (CPI) declined by 0.1 percent in December on a seasonally adjusted basis after being unchanged in November, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics said.The drop in the all items index was the result of a sharp fall in the gasoline index which plunged by 7.5 percent last month, more than offsetting increases in several indexes including shelter, food, and other energy components.



The energy index declined by 3.5 percent in December, after a 2.2-percent drop in the previous month. The gasoline index, for its part, plunged in December following a 4.2-percent drop in November, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said.Gasoline prices started to drop shortly after oil prices began to collapse at the end of last year, when both the U.S. and international benchmarks, WTI Crude and Brent Crude, respectively, plunged by 40 percent between October and December.Over the past 12 months, the energy index dropped by 0.3 percent for the first 12-month decline in the energy index since the period ending September 2016, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Over the past year, the gasoline index fell by 2.1 percent, more than offsetting increases in the other component indexes. In 2018, the gasoline index fell 2.1 percent after rising in 2016 and 2017, more than offsetting increases in other energy component indexes.



The drop in international crude oil prices resulted in the cheapest New Year national gas price average in three years, according to AAA.As of January 7, the national gas price average was US$2.24 and had declined for 12 consecutive weeks, AAA said earlier this week. The national average was three cents cheaper on the week, 20 cents cheaper than last month and 25 cents cheaper year-over-year.

China imported 30 percent more crude oil in December than a year earlier, Reuters reports, citing fresh customs data.The surge was the result of independent refiners rushing to exhaust their import quotas before the end of the year. The rush pushed the daily rate of shipments to 10.31 million bpd. That’s the second month in a row when Chinese refiners imported more than 10 million bpd of crude oil, Reuters notes, with the December figure slightly below the record-high November import rate.



Crude oil imports for the full 2018 averaged 9.24 million bpd, up by a little over 10 percent on an annual basis, or 846,600 bpd more than the average daily import rate for 2017.Natural gas imports broke the previous record in December, according to the customs data, which was only to be expected as Beijing sought to make sure there would be no repeat of the December 2017 gas shortage, which was brought about by efforts to reduce coal consumption in favor of gas. However, lack of adequate distribution infrastructure led to outages leaving millions of households in the north of the country without heating.



In December 2018, therefore, China imported 9.23 million tons of gas, both by pipeline and as LNG, up 17 percent on the year. Since it began preparing for the winter early in 2018, total natural gas imports for last year soared by almost 32 percent from 2017 to 90.39 million tons, solidifying China’s position as the world’s biggest importer of the fuel.The country is also the world’s second-largest importer of LNG because of its drive to shift away from coal and into gas as it fights one of the worst pollution problems globally. This has naturally made it a magnet for LNG producers around the world as its demand for the fuel is expected to rise consistently over the coming years.

Indian oil imports from Iran plunged by 41 percent on the year to just over 300,000 bpd in December, roughly around the level of Iranian oil India is restricted to buy under the U.S. waiver, allowing it to continue importing oil from Tehran, according to ship tracking data reviewed by Reuters.Compared to November, India’s oil imports from Iran increased by 9.4 percent in December after some cargoes had been delayed in November due to lack of tankers, according to the data.In November, India’s oil imports from Iran dropped to a one-year-low, plunging by 41 percent from October due to the U.S. sanctions on Tehran’s oil. Iran also dropped to sixth place on India’s largest oil suppliers list, from fourth in October, losing market share to fellow OPEC members Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).



In November, the month in which the U.S. sanctions snapped back, India’s oil imports from Iran averaged 276,000 bpd, as India had cut back significantly its allocations for November amid uncertainties over who might be getting a U.S. waiver to continue importing oil from Iran.India did get a waiver, alongside seven other Iranian oil customers, including the single biggest, China. The waivers allow those eight countries to continue Iranian oil imports at reduced volumes until early May 2019. India’s allowed imports from Iran are about 300,000 bpd.In November, Iran was only sixth among India’s top oil suppliers. Iraq and Saudi Arabia held the first two spots, while the UAE—sixth in October—moved up to third place, ousting Venezuela to fourth. Nigeria held onto its fifth position, but Iran moved from fourth in October to sixth in November, according to industry and ship-tracking data obtained by Reuters.



According to the December tanker tracking data reviewed by Reuters, Iran was India’s sixth largest oil supplier in December, too. In December 2017, Iran was the third biggest oil supplier to India. In December 2018, Iran’s market share in India’s oil imports plunged to 6.2 percent from 11.7 percent in December 2017, according to the tanker tracking data. By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Darkening Outlook For Global Economy Threatens CrudeSomething Extraordinary Is Happening In Jet Fuel MarketsThe Natural Gas Crash Isn’t Over

Wind, natural gas, and solar capacity will lead the new electricity capacity in the United States this year, while coal-fired generation will account for more than half of scheduled capacity retirements, the EIA said in its latest inventory of electric generators.In 2019, the U.S. electric power sector is expected to add 23.7 gigawatts (GW) of new capacity, while 8.3 GW capacity is planned to be retired. New utility-scale capacity will be led by wind power, which will account for 46 percent of the additions, followed by natural gas with a 34-percent share of new capacity, and solar photovoltaics, which will make up 18 percent of new electric capacity, the EIA said. The remaining 2 percent of new additions will consist mainly of other renewables and battery storage capacity.



In wind power, a total of 10.9 GW of capacity is currently planned to start up this year, with Texas, Iowa, and Illinois accounting for more than half of the 2019 planned wind capacity additions.New natural gas capacity will be mostly combined-cycle plants, which are planned to add 6.1 GW of electric capacity, while combustion-turbine plants are scheduled for 1.4 GW new capacity. Most of the natural gas-powered electric capacity is planned to become operational by the middle of the year in order to be able to meet high summer demand, the EIA said. Sixty percent of all new natural gas-fired capacity will take place in three states—Pennsylvania, Florida, and Louisiana.Related: Oil Enters Bull Market As Shorts Are Wiped OutSolar photovoltaics will add 4.3 GW this year, and nearly half of those capacity additions will be in Texas, California, and North Carolina.



Among the capacity scheduled for retirement, coal will lead with 53 percent of all planned retirements, followed by natural gas with 27 percent, and nuclear with 18 percent. One hydroelectric plant in Washington State and other smaller renewable and petroleum capacity retirements will account for the remaining 2 percent.The 4.5 GW of coal-fired electric capacity that is planned for retirement this year is relatively small compared with the estimated 13.7 GW of coal generation capacity that retired in 2018. Last year saw the second-highest amount of coal capacity retired in a year in the United States, according to the EIA.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Colombia’s Oil Rebound Off To A Rough Start In 2019OPEC’s No.2 Boosted Production, Exports Just Before Cuts BeganThe 3 Continents Driving Global Energy Demand

Dam construction involves higher environmental and social costs than previously estimated, a new study has suggested.The study, cited by Phys.org, was carried out by researchers from Michigan State University and found that ""When a large dam is built, the result is a downstream loss of a great many fish species that are important to riverine populations. These communities will have to continue somehow making a living despite dwindling fish stocks for 15 or 20 years, for example, and the costs of these projects don't take such economic and social losses into account,"" as explained by the lead author of the study, Emilio Moran.A lot of developed countries have stopped building large-scale dams and have switched to smaller hydropower installations but developing countries such as Brazil are still investing in large dam construction.""We argue that if the construction of large dams in developing countries is to continue, it must always be preceded by a painstaking assessment of their real cost, including the environmental and social impact they have,"" Moran noted. The lead author of the study is visiting professor at the University of Campinas in Sau Paulo state in Brazil. The environmental costs of large-scale hydropower installations are not new but they don’t seem to get as much attention as other forms of power generation. The Union of Concerned Scientists, for example, cites an article on the environmental and social impacts of the world’s biggest dam, the Three Gorges, in China.Its construction involved the flooding of a huge region, destroying ecosystems, affecting wildlife habitats and necessitating the relocation of entire communities. The total number of people displaced because of the project was 1.13 million.What’s more, dams don’t last forever. They need to be retired and dismantled and this bears a high financial cost, too. ""The cost of removing a dam once its useful life is over is extremely high, and should be taken into account when computing the total cost of a new hydro development,"" Moran notes. ""If the cost of removal had to be included, many dams wouldn't be built. It would be far more expensive to produce a kilowatt-hour of electricity via a hydro complex with a useful life of 30 to 50 years, like those under construction in Brazil.""

OPEC producer Angola is putting the finishing touches on its first oil licensing round in eight years, hoping to replace dwindling production at some maturing fields and seeing renewed investor appetite in its oil industry, Angola’s Minister of Mineral Resources and Petroleum Diamantino Pedro Azevedo told S&P Global Platts in an interview published on Friday.Angola is preparing a strategy for onshore and offshore oil and gas blocks licensing for the period 2019 through 2025, Azevedo said.After the oil price crash of 2014, Angola’s economy had suffered from the low oil prices and the country had also been struggling to attract international investments in its deepwater higher-breakeven oil resources.



Last year, Angola introduced several new measures to try to boost its oil production and its attractiveness for international investment. President Joao Lourenco signed in the summer of 2018 a decree to create an agency that would sell and manage oil blocks instead of state oil firm Sonangol. The National Agency of Petroleum and Gas is expected to launch in 2019 and be fully operational by the end of 2020.Earlier in 2018, Angola halved the tax rates on the development of oil discoveries with fewer than 300 million barrels of reserves. Angola cut the petroleum production tax on so-called marginal fields—those with less than 300 million barrels of reserves—to 10 percent from the typical 20 percent tax. The tax reforms also halved the petroleum income tax on marginal fields to 25 percent from 50 percent.Angola’s upcoming licensing round comes as interest in the country’s oil sector has increased and as a new major start-up—the biggest deep offshore development in Angola, Kaombo, came on stream, contributing 115,000 bpd to Angola’s oil production. The second phase of the project led by France’s Total will add another 115,000 bpd of production and is expected to start up this year.



Angola, however, is sticking to its pledge in the OPEC/non-OPEC deal to hold its oil production at 1.481 million bpd between January and June, its petroleum minister Azevedo told S&P Global Platts.According to the latest OPEC figures, Angola’s oil production was 1.521 million bpd in November, basically flat compared to October. OPEC will report the December production levels of its members next week.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:U.S. Rig Count Flat As Canadian Drillers Add 100 Rigs In Winter SeasonOil Enters Bull Market As Shorts Are Wiped OutThere Is Still Room To Run For Oil Prices

The Trans Adriatic Pipeline (TAP)—one of the European Union’s (EU) key strategic infrastructure projects to diversify Europe’s gas deliveries away from Russia—has secured US$4.5 billion (3.9 billion euro) in project financing, paving the way for first deliveries of gas from Azerbaijan to Italy in 2020.TAP reached the financial close of the project financing in December 2018, the company developing and building the gas pipeline said in a statement on Friday.The project financing is provided by a group of 17 commercial banks, alongside the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and the European Investment Bank (EIB). Part of the financing is covered by export credit agencies bpifrance, Euler Hermes, and Sace.“With project financing now concluded, TAP can progress to the final completion of the project and delivery of Shah Deniz II gas in 2020,” said Luca Schieppati, TAP’s Managing Director.



As of November 2018, TAP was 82.4 percent completed.TAP is a key part of the Southern Gas Corridor—a key infrastructure project for Europe aimed at diversifying gas supplies away from Russia and bringing natural gas from the Caspian Sea region to European markets.The Southern Gas Corridor consists of several separate energy projects with a total investment of around US$40 billion.One is the US$28-billion Shah Deniz 2 gas development in Azerbaijan, which BP and its partners started up in July last year. Shah Deniz 2 is the starting point of the Southern Gas Corridor for gas supplies into Europe expected to reduce European dependence on Russian gas.



The Southern Gas Corridor will include three pipelines—the South Caucasus Pipeline (SCPX) to Azerbaijan and Georgia; the Trans Anatolian Pipeline (TANAP) to Turkey; and TAP, planned to cross Greece, Albania, and end up in Italy.At the end of November, TAP and TANAP successfully completed their connection at the Turkish-Greek border.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Haynesville Shale About To Break All-Time Gas Output RecordThere Is Still Room To Run For Oil PricesOil Enters Bull Market As Shorts Are Wiped Out

General Motors will make Cadillac its first electric car under the BEV3 platform, according to unnamed sources talking to Reuters. The electric Cadillac will become the flagship GM challenger to Tesla, the sources said.An announcement, according to the sources, is expected later today, but details such as a timeline and specifications are unlikely to be divulged. GM has previously tried to make plug-in hybrids under the Cadillac brands but these sold badly and were discontinued after only a couple of years in production.GM’s current EV portfolio includes the Chevrolet Volt, a plug-in hybrid, and the Bolt, an all-electric vehicle. But the mass market Chevrolet brand cannot take on Tesla, which has cornered the luxury EV market. Cadillac, on the other hand, could be a worthy opponent.



The biggest carmaker in the United States two years ago announced EV manufacturing plans that included building a dedicated electric vehicle architecture and launching it by 2021 along with a battery system, with the two to be used to develop at 20 new electric models in both the U.S. and China, the world’s largest EV market.Also in 2017, chief executive Marry Barra said General Motors planned to launch at least 10 new EVs for the Chinese market specifically by 2020. Last year, Barra said the company eyed electric car sales of 1 million per year by 2026, with a substantial part of the total sold in China.Last year, General Motors opened a battery factory in China in partnership with local carmaker SAIC Motor Corp. as part of its expansion plans for the Chinese market.



Last year, the then-president of Cadillac told Reuters Cadillac will have a “central role” in GM’s EV strategy for the future, not just on the domestic market but also in China. Cadillac sales in China are on the rise, with the figure last year exceeding 200,000 for the first time, Reuters notes.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Oil Enters Bull Market As Shorts Are Wiped OutPoland Scrambles To Wean Itself Off Russian GasThere Is Still Room To Run For Oil Prices

China will only approve new solar and wind power capacity if it matches the country’s coal benchmark on price, Forbes’ John Parnell reports, adding a project approved last month became the first to produce solar at a cost as low as coal-fired power plants.The requirement for price matching with coal is part of a new set of conditions drafted by China’s National Development and Reform Commission, which will be in effect until 2020 in a bid to handle all the problems resulting from the fast growth in solar and wind capacity installation in recent years, such as energy waste because of grid logjams.



In 2017, Parnell notes, 6 percent of solar power output and 12 percent of wind power produced in China was wasted, and although in 2018 the waste was reduced, it still remains problematic.The quick growth in solar in particular also put a strain on Beijing’s wallet because of the generous feed-in subsidies for new installations. In 2017, these hit US$15.6 billion (100 billion yuan) and the government has still not paid these in full. At the rate of new solar capacity approvals from the last few years, subsidy costs would have reached US$39 billion by 2020, according to Wood Mac estimates.



The government solved this problem inelegantly but efficiently last year when it announced in June that no more solar power project construction permits will be issued until the end of the year, prompting analysts to cut their capacity addition forecasts by between 5 GW and 17 GW.But there is also another reason for the new project approval conditions, according to Forbes’ Parnell: Beijing is reportedly annoyed by the fact that Chinese companies are building solar projects abroad that produce electricity much more cheaply than the installations at home. So, now the authorities will require that solar and wind companies not only guarantee they will produce electricity cheaply but also that it will not overburden the grid.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:There Is Still Room To Run For Oil PricesAmerica’s Remarkable Dual Achievement In EnergyOil Enters Bull Market As Shorts Are Wiped Out

Russia’s production and exports of coal hit last year their highest levels since 2013, according to S&P Global Platts estimates of data from Russia’s Energy Ministry.Russian coal exports increased last year by 3.4 percent compared to 2017, to reach 191 million mt—the highest level since S&P Global Platts started collecting data on Russia’s coal industry in 2013.Coal production also reached its highest level since 2013—at 431.76 million mt, Russia’s production increased by 6 percent in 2018 compared to 2017. 



According to Platts estimates and to thermal coal traders who spoke to Platts, Russian producers continue to seek domination on the European market and have been putting in a lot of effort to grab more market shares on the Asian markets such as South Korea and Taiwan.Last year, the average free on board (FOB) coal prices for the Atlantic and Pacific markets were both higher compared to 2017, which could be a big incentive for Russia to continue producing and exporting more coal to seaborne destinations, according to Platts.Russia’s Energy Minister Alexander Novak briefed on Thursday President Vladimir Putin on the Russian energy sector production in 2018, saying that the coal production of around 433 million tons was planned to be reached in 2020. Russia plans to invest around US$22.4 billion (1.5 trillion Russian rubles) in its coal industry and port infrastructure, Novak told Putin. 



Russia’s oil production increased by 1.6 percent annually to 556 million tons last year, the energy minister said. Natural gas production beat an 18-year-old record as Russia produced 725 billion cubic meters of natural gas in 2018, raising production by around 5 percent compared to 2017, Novak told Putin. Due to the OPEC+ production cuts, Russia’s crude oil production in 2019 could be lower than originally planned—at 552 million tons, or 11.085 million bpd, Novak said last month after the new OPEC/non-OPEC deal was struck. Originally, plans for next year were for Russia’s oil production to stand at 555 million tons-556 million tons, or 11.145 million bpd-11.165 million bpd, according to Novak.

Saudi Arabia has made a first tangible step to generate electricity from sources other than oil and gas, awarding a contract on Thursday for the Kingdom’s first utility-scale wind farm.  A consortium led by France’s EDF and Abu Dhabi’s Masdar has won the tender to build a 400-megawatt (MW) US$500-million wind farm in northern Saudi Arabia, AFP quoted the energy ministry of the Kingdom as saying.The first utility-scale wind project in the country is another significant step “towards creating a diversified power sector mix,” according to the Saudi ministry.



Saudi Arabia has also started to work with a fund owned by SoftBank to have one day a total of 200 gigawatts (GW) of solar power in the country, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said last month.Saudi Arabia has its National Renewable Energy Program, under which the Kingdom aims to boost the share of renewables in its energy mix in coming years. The Saudis are targeting 3.45 GW worth of generation from renewable energy by 2020, which would represent around 4 percent of generation capacity. By 2023, the Saudi target is 9.5 GW, which would account for 10 percent of generation capacity.The Saudi renewable energy program is directly supporting the Vision 2030 strategy to overhaul the economy and diversify it away from oil.



Ironically, the Saudis expect to fund part of the Vision 2030 plan with the proceeds they expect to reap from the initial public offering (IPO) of 5 percent in state oil giant Aramco. Saudi Arabia’s rulers, including Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, have insisted that Aramco is worth a total of US$2 trillion.The Aramco share sale, initially planned for 2018, was one of the biggest flops in Saudi energy policy last year, and the latest indicative date for the IPO has been now pushed to 2021, “depending on market conditions at the time.”  By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:WoodMac: LNG Glut Not Likely In 2019The 3 Continents Driving Global Energy DemandOPEC’s No.2 Boosted Production, Exports Just Before Cuts Began

Iran will not be complying with the “fully illegal” U.S. sanctions, Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said on Thursday, in yet another defiant statement from Tehran after the American sanctions on Iran’s oil and shipping industry snapped back in early November.“We believe that we should not comply with the illegal sanctions against Iran,” Reuters quoted Zanganeh as saying at a joint press conference with Iraq’s Oil Minister Thamer Ghadhban during a visit to Baghdad.While it stays under U.S. sanctions, Iran will not be discussing the volume or the destination of its oil exports, the Iranian oil minister noted.During his visit to Iraq, Zanganeh discussed with his counterpart cooperation in different areas, “especially on oil issues,” the Iranian minister said.



Iraq and Iran have not reached yet any agreement on potential development of the oil fields the two countries share, Iraq’s minister Ghadhban said.  Since the U.S. sanctions on Iran’s oil entered into force on November 5, Iran has continuously claimed that the United States will not be able to choke off all its oil exports.A month after the sanctions were reinstated, Iran’s First Vice-President Eshaq Jahangiri said that the Iranian government could manage the country even without relying on oil export revenues.Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani, meanwhile, reiterated in early December that the U.S. cannot stop Iran from exporting its oil.  



“The United States said it would stop Iran’s oil export and business relations, making Iran isolated, but it could not do it and it won’t be able to sever our relations with the peoples of the region,” Rouhani said in an address.“We will sell our oil and they can’t stop us from doing this, said Rouhani adding, “If the US wants to stop our oil sales, no oil will be exported from the Persian Gulf,” according to Rouhani’s speech as carried by the official website of the Iranian President.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Darkening Outlook For Global Economy Threatens CrudeColombia’s Oil Rebound Off To A Rough Start In 2019Oil Enters Bull Market As Shorts Are Wiped Out

Glencore has lost its exclusive right to market two of Libya’s crude grades and oil companies like Shell and BP have already had their first allocations of the grades to which the Switzerland-based commodity giant had held exclusive rights since 2015, Reuters reported on Thursday, quoting trading sources with direct knowledge of the events. Glencore held the rights to market Libyan grades Sarir and Messla until the end of last year. The commodity trader was one of the few companies venturing into exclusive crude oil marketing deals with Libya in the wake of the 2011 unrest. Back in 2015, Glencore secured a deal with Libya’s National Oil Corporation (NOC) to buy half of the country’s then oil production of around 400,000 bpd. That deal was for the only relatively stable onshore production in Libya at the time, with civil unrest and port blockades crippling the country’s oil production in recent years.At the beginning of last year, Glencore was said to have extended its exclusive trading deal for an unknown period of time. The deal gave Glencore the right to be the sole trader of some 230,000 bpd from the oil fields Sarir and Messla. Now it seems Glencore has lost the exclusivity, and other traders and trading arms of oil supermajors are moving in to lift Sarir and Messla crude grades. “Companies like BP and Shell had their first Messla and Sarir allocation,” one trading source told Reuters. Unipec, the trading arm of Chinese state oil major Sinopec, is also set to lift three cargoes from the Libyan port Marsa el Hariga, from which the Sarir and Messla crude grades are exported, according to a Reuters source. Over the past year, Libya has recovered part of its oil production, despite a huge port blockade in the summer that basically shut in nearly all of its exports for weeks. The biggest oil field in Libya, Sharara, is currently under force majeure due to a blockade by tribesmen and members of the Petroleum Facilities Guard demanding payments to lift the blockade. Libya’s NOC had an average oil production of 1.107 million barrels per day in 2018, NOC’s chairman Mustafa Sanalla said this past weekend. Total revenues reached US$24.4 billion, the highest since 2013 and a 78-percent annual rise. If the security situation improves, Libya plans to pump 2.1 million bpd of crude oil by 2021, Sanalla said. By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Darkening Outlook For Global Economy Threatens CrudeSomething Extraordinary Is Happening In Jet Fuel MarketsThe Natural Gas Crash Isn’t Over

Saudi Aramco is getting ready to issue a bond in the second quarter of 2019 to help it finance the acquisition of a majority stake in petrochemical giant Sabic, and this debt issue would force Saudi Arabia’s state oil firm to disclose its financials and oil reserves for the first time in decades, Bloomberg reports.Aramco’s bond sale will probably be in U.S. dollars, Bloomberg quoted Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih as saying at a presentation of the plan in Riyadh.“We will work with our advisers and find the right time to go to market and part of that would be a prospectus that would have appropriate financial statements and disclosures,” al-Falih said, commenting on the plans for the bond sale.



Saudi Aramco—whose initial public offering (IPO) touted for 2018 is now all but scrapped—plans to buy 70 percent in Sabic currently in the hands of the Public Investment Fund (PIF) of Saudi Arabia in a deal expected to be worth US$70 billion.Aramco’s acquisition of a majority stake in Sabic would be key to the oil giant’s strategy to expand in the downstream segment and curb emissions, Aramco’s chief executive Amin Nasser told the Financial Times in September.  Reports of how Aramco plans to finance the acquisition of the majority stake in Sabic started to circulate in October last year, with some reports saying that Aramco may borrow US$50 billion from international banks to finance that deal.



The most recent market rumors have had it that Aramco could fund the entire US$70-billion price tag for buying 70 percent in Sabic with the upcoming bond issue. Al-Falih, however, dismissed that chatter saying that “It’s not going to be anywhere near the number that’s been rumored.”The Saudi energy minister also confirmed the date that the Kingdom has been giving lately for Aramco’s IPO to finally take place—2021.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads from Oilprice.com:Darkening Outlook For Global Economy Threatens CrudeSomething Extraordinary Is Happening In Jet Fuel MarketsThe Natural Gas Crash Isn’t Over

The Trump administration is pursuing its plans of opening up more federal lands in Alaska to oil and gas drilling.Reuters reports the Alaska Bureau of Land Management had not canceled a scheduled public meeting on the topic on Wednesday despite the shutdown, which has affected the Department of Interior, along with another eight federal agencies, albeit partially.Plans to open up more land to drilling in the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska have already been discussed at several public meetings, which the Bureau of Land Management is obligated to hold, but some have questioned the legality of the meetings scheduled and held during the shutdown.



“There were a lot of people concerned about how they’re conducting business during the shutdown,” said Martha Itta, an administrator for the tribal government of an Alaskan village of 450, told Reuters. “There was even a question to them if the meeting was illegal,” she said.A spokesman for the Bureau of Land Management, however, said public hearings about drilling permits for the National Petroleum Reserve were exempt from the government shutdown.“The Bureau continues to process permit applications as they are an exempted activity during a lapse in appropriations,” the spokesman said.



Yet, Reuters notes, the Alaskan unit of the BLM earlier this week said it will postpone the public hearings on another drilling expansion plan for the Arctic: opening up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. The deadline for submitting public comments on the topic has been extended to February 11.Congress voted to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for drilling in December 2017, after forty years of often heated discussions of the issue. In 2018, the Department of the Interior said it had allocated US$4 million for construction work ahead of the start of oil and gas drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.

Tesla will stop offering the lowest-priced versions of its Models S and X, chief executive Elon Musk wrote in a tweet.“Starting on Monday, Tesla will no longer be taking orders for the 75 kWh version of the Model S & X,” Musk wrote, adding if anyone wanted to order either of these models they could do it until Sunday night.In response to a Twitter user question whether the company was “moving away from battery sizing in a similar sense to how Model 3s are sold ie Long Range, Performance etc?” Musk confirmed this was the case, dismissing concern that Tesla might begin to phase out the Model S and the Model X.



CNBC notes in its report of the news that the cheapest versions of the Model S and the Model X featuring 75 kWh batteries have a range of 259 and 237 miles, respectively. The next-cheapest Model S and Model X that will remain in production feature a battery of 100 kWh, with starting prices at US$94,000 for the Model S and US$97,000 for the Model X.This compares with US$67,000 for the most enhanced version of the Model 3, featuring a dual motor all-wheel drive, an enhanced Autopilot system, and a US$5,000 performance upgrade package, writes CNBC’s Lora Kolodny. Kolodny notes the discontinuation of the cheaper Model S and Model X versions could be a move to boost the sales of the Model 3, already pretty strong.Tesla delivered 90,700 vehicles in the last quarter of 2018, more than all the cars it delivered to clients in 2017, the company reported. It also delivered a total 245,240 cars in full-2018, which is more than Tesla’s deliveries for all prior years, the company said.



The Q4 2018 number was 8 percent higher than in the previous quarter, with the Model 3 booking the largest increase in deliveries, from 55,840 in the third quarter, to 63,150 in the final quarter of last year.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:The 3 Continents Driving Global Energy DemandA Drastic Shift In Oil Market SentimentThe Natural Gas Crash Isn’t Over

South Korea will start buying Iranian crude this month or next, the parent company of the country’s largest refinery, SK Innovation, told Reuters.“As South Korea received a waiver and has been in talks with Iran about the first import volume, it seems (Iran oil) could be brought in late in January or early February at the earliest,” the chief executive of the company, Kim Jun said.



South Korea stopped buying Iranian oil completely ahead of the November 4 sanctions imposed on Iran by Washington. South Korea is the world’s fifth-largest crude oil importer, and as such an important client for Iran’s oil alongside China and India. Yet South Korea is a close ally of the United States, and it is no surprise the country opted for full compliance with Washington’s insistence on importers to cut their intake of Iranian crude to zero.Thanks to this strategy, South Korea was among eight Iranian oil importers that were granted six-month sanction waivers in November, alongside India, China, Japan, and Italy. In the same month, after the announcement of the waivers, S&P Global Platts reported, citing unnamed sources, that South Korea would resume Iranian crude oil imports at a rate of about 4 million barrels a month.



According to the new Reuters report, South Korea could import up to 200,000 bpd of Iranian crude, most of it’s the superlight grade called condensate: the country was Iran’s biggest condensate buyer before the sanctions and its third-largest importer of oil.Buying Iranian oil will likely be cautious, however: even with the waivers, Washington has made it clear it expected its allies to eventually reduce their intake of Iranian crude to zero, replacing it with crude from other sources, including from the United States. While some would probably do their best to comply, others, such as India, perhaps won’t be able to afford such a move: New Delhi recently launched a supposedly sanction-proof payments system for Iranian crude.

Bank of Canada said on Wednesday that it expects real gross domestic product (GDP) to grow by 1.7 percent this year, revising down its forecast by 0.4 percentage points compared to the October outlook, as the drop in global oil prices over the past two months has a material impact on the Canadian outlook.“The drop in global oil prices has a material impact on the Canadian outlook, resulting in lower terms of trade and national income,” the bank said today, keeping the target interest rate at 1.75 percent.Referring to the pace of interest hikes, Bank of Canada said that “The appropriate pace of rate increases will depend on how the outlook evolves, with a particular focus on developments in oil markets, the Canadian housing market, and global trade policy.”



Apart from lower international oil prices, Canada’s oil industry has seen transportation constraints and rising production, which “have combined to push up oil inventories in the west and exert even more downward pressure on Canadian benchmark prices.”“While price differentials have narrowed in recent weeks following announced mandatory production cuts in Alberta, investment in Canada’s oil sector is projected to weaken further,” according to Bank of Canada.In its Monetary Policy report also published on Wednesday, the bank said that the key challenges to its economic outlook would be the developments in oil markets.Related: Is This The Answer To Canada’s Oil Crisis?



“The outlook is subject to several sources of uncertainty, including the persistence of the oil price decline and the size of spillovers to non-oil-producing regions, the adjustment of household spending to tighter mortgage finance guidelines and higher interest rates, and global trade policy and geopolitical issues,” the bank noted.Since the October report, the sentiment in the Canadian energy sector has deteriorated, according to the bank’s consultations with firms in the industry. Although Alberta’s oil production cut has helped narrow the price differentials of Canadian heavy oil to WTI—with the discount at its narrowest in a year this week—energy companies in Canada continue to be concerned about the outlook in the medium term, Bank of Canada said.“For instance, the ongoing lack of export infrastructure continues to hamper the ability of many energy firms to raise funds in debt and equity markets,” the bank noted.

A day before Venezuela’s President Nicolas Maduro will be sworn in for a second six-year term in office, Human Rights Watch and Venezuelan non-governmental group Foro Penal said on Wednesday that Venezuela’s intelligence and security forces had detained, tortured, and abused military personnel accused of “treason” and “instigating rebellion”.“The Venezuelan government has brutally cracked down on members of the military accused of plotting against it,” José Miguel Vivanco, Americas director at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement.“Not only are intelligence agents detaining and torturing members of the military, in some cases they are also going after their families or other civilians when they can’t find the suspects.”According to HRW, these are not isolated cases: instead, they point to a systematic practice by the Venezuelan security forces since 2014.



Meanwhile, Nicolas Maduro will be sworn in on Thursday for a second term as president of the country whose economic and social meltdown defies belief. According to the IMF, Venezuela’s economy will have collapsed by 18 percent in 2018, while the 2019 annual inflation rate is expected to be 10 million percent. More than 3 million Venezuelan people have fled the country amid an aggravating humanitarian crisis and an extreme poverty rate of 40 percent.The economic collapse adds to years of mismanagement and underinvestment in the oil industry to further complicate attempts in Venezuela, one of OPEC’s five founding members, to stop the steep decline of its oil production.According to OPEC’s secondary sources, Venezuela’s crude oil production continues to plunge—by another 52,000 bpd from October to stand at 1.137 million bpd in November. To compare, Venezuela’s oil production averaged 2.154 million bpd for 2016 and 1.911 million bpd for 2017.



The U.S. sanctioned on Tuesday seven Venezuelan individuals and 23 entities involved in a corruption scheme designed to take advantage of the Government of Venezuela’s currency exchange practices, generating more than US$2.4 billion in corrupt proceeds.Meanwhile, Russia’s Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov warned the “hotheads” in the U.S., as TASS news agency put it, against a military scenario in Venezuela.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:U.S. Army Joins Race To Expand U.S. Oil ExportsOil Posts Longest Rally In 17 MonthsWhy 2019 Will Be A Record Breaking Year For LNG

The U.S.-China trade dispute and the soaring U.S. oil production are the key concerns for the oil market this year, according to Suhail Al Mazrouei, the Energy Minister of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), who served as OPEC’s rotating president in 2018, when oil prices had a volatile run that led to another production cut intervention by the cartel.A heated U.S.-China trade war could be one of the strongest headwinds to global economy this year, Al Mazrouei told CNBC in an interview on Wednesday, but noted that he was cautiously optimistic that the world’s two largest economies would come to an agreement on trade.“And I tend to be... more optimistic that we are not going to see a war. It's negotiation tactics, they will end on a resolution, whatever it takes, this year or next year,” Al Mazrouei told CNBC.



Referring to the latest production policies of OPEC and its Russia-led non-OPEC allies, the UAE’s energy minister stressed again that OPEC is not chasing a specific oil price.  “What we learn is the fact that if you make the market at balance, you will get a price that is good for the consumer and a price that is good for the investors. And that price, whatever it is, is going to be the price that we have to accept,” Al Mazrouei said.While OPEC hears what the U.S. and President Donald Trump have to say about oil prices, the cartel is “not playing with President Trump or any other president,” the UAE’s energy minister said.



“I think what we do is we hear them (the U.S.). They are major consumers versus the major producing nations, we hear what they say but we will always do the right thing from our perspective which is always trying to maintain the balance.”Asked about how relevant the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has become in today’s oil market, Al Mazrouei told CNBC:“I think OPEC will always be there. I don’t think we can afford not to have OPEC.”  By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:WoodMac: Demand For Oil In Transportation Sector To Peak In A DecadeU.S. Army Joins Race To Expand U.S. Oil ExportsOil Posts Longest Rally In 17 Months

Tesla has been warning its buyers who have ordered the ‘Full Self-Driving package’ that the option may not be available for a very long time because of regulations in various countries, Electrek reported on Wednesday, citing warnings from Tesla sales advisors who are processing vehicle orders.“Before I take your order for the FSD, I would like to point out that the legal aspect of Full Self Driving is very far away. Especially in Europe, the USA might be closer to get it legalized,” sales advisors warn buyers, according to Electrek.“So even when we have the hardware ready, and your car would have it, you would most likely not be able to use it for a very long time,” according to Tesla’s sales people.



In October last year, Tesla pulled out the ‘Full Self-Driving’ package for its electric vehicles (EVs) from the order page on its website.Elon Musk tweeted at the time that it “was causing too much confusion.”While the Full Self-Driving package may not be usable for a very long time until various countries across the world discuss, approve, and legalize it, Tesla’s Musk believes that no other auto manufacturer can beat Tesla to the self-driving capabilities.



In an interview with Recode Decode hosted by Kara Swisher in November 2018, Musk said “I don’t wanna sound overconfident, but I would be very surprised if any of the car companies exceeded Tesla in self-driving, in getting to full self-driving.”“You know, I think we’ll get to full self-driving next year. As a generalized solution, I think. But that’s a ... Like we’re on track to do that next year. So I don’t know. I don’t think anyone else is on track to do it next year,” Musk said.According to Musk, none of Tesla’s competitors could ever be a serious competitor in self-driving. “They’re just not good at software. And this is a software problem,” he told Recode Decode in November.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:WoodMac: Demand For Oil In Transportation Sector To Peak In A DecadeU.S. Army Joins Race To Expand U.S. Oil ExportsOil Posts Longest Rally In 17 Months

The World Bank expects oil prices to average $67 a barrel this year and next, down $2 compared to projections from June last year, the bank said in its Global Economic Prospects report, in which it also revised down its global growth projections amid “darkening skies” for the global economy.Oil prices were highly volatile in the second half of 2018, with sharp plunges toward the end of 2018, chiefly due to supply-side factors, the World Bank said. Last year, oil prices averaged $68 a barrel, slightly lower compared to the bank’s forecast from June 2018, but 30 percent higher than the average price of oil in 2017.“Oil prices are expected to average $67/bbl in 2019 and 2020, $2/bbl lower than June projections; however, uncertainty around the forecast is high,” the World Bank said in its January 2019 Global Economic Prospects report.



This year, oil demand growth is expected to stay robust, but expected slowdown in emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs) “could have a greater impact on oil demand than expected,” the World Bank said.The outlook for the supply-side is also uncertain as it largely hinges on OPEC and allies’ decisions about production levels, especially after the first half of 2019, according to the bank.“While these producers have agreed to cut output by 1.2mb/d for six months starting January 2019, few details have been forthcoming about the distribution of the cuts, and they may prove insufficient to reduce the oversupply of oil,” the World Bank said.



The other key uncertainties about oil prices will be the impact of the U.S. sanctions on Iran when the waivers end in early May, as well as the production in Venezuela, which has been steadily falling over the past two years.Related: Is This The Answer To Canada’s Oil Crisis?“Meanwhile, crude oil output in the United States is expected to rise by a further 1mb/d in 2019, with capacity constraints envisioned to ease in the second half of the year as new pipelines come onstream,” according to the World Bank.Apart from revising down its oil price projections and warning about the uncertainties surrounding oil price trends this year, the World Bank also noted that global economic growth is expected to slow to 2.9 percent in 2019 from 3 percent in 2018, as international trade and investment weaken.“The outlook for the global economy has darkened. Global financing conditions have tightened, industrial production has moderated, trade tensions have intensified, and some large emerging market and developing economies have experienced significant financial market stress,” the World Bank said.

Brent Crude prices are expected to trade between $60 and $70 a barrel by the second half of this year, unless a sharp global economic slowdown mars the outlook for global oil demand, the Arab Petroleum Investments Corporation (APICORP) said in its latest energy research note.Following the four-year highs of $85 Brent Crude in October, the international benchmark slumped to just $54 at the end of 2018. The key reasons were concerns about global economy, rising production in the three biggest oil producers—the U.S., Russia, and Saudi Arabia—and a drop in sentiment, said (APICORP), a multilateral development bank set up in 1975 under an agreement signed by the ten Member States of the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC).   The collective production cut of 1.2 million bpd from OPEC and its Russia-led non-OPEC partners in the deal might not be enough, APICORP warns, but noted that “The dynamics of oil prices in 2019 will also depend in large part on OPEC’s effectiveness in implementing the cuts, balancing the market and reinforcing the credibility of its signals.”



“While OPEC is expected to cut its output in 2019 in an attempt to balance the market, US production should maintain its upward momentum,” the bank said.According to APICORP, the pace of global oil demand will be more important for oil prices than the supply side of the market.Related: Oil Posts Longest Rally In 17 Months“According to recent research from the OIES, stronger than expected oil demand growth has been responsible for 80% of the market rebalancing and thus any slowdown in the global economy that results in lower demand growth will have a drastic effect on oil prices. And concerns about the global economy have been mounting,” APICORP said.



“In conclusion, purely based on fundamentals, a collective cut of 1.2 mb/d between OPEC and its allies, high probability of supply losses from Iran, Venezuela, Libya and Canada, and global oil demand growth of 1.4 mb/d, the market will achieve balance in 2019.”Oil prices will continue to be under pressure until the market begins to show signs of stock drawdowns, according to APICORP.“OPEC’s primary challenge will be to address the physical market imbalances, and assert its credibility to consistently manage expectations and sentiment,” the bank said.

The gasoline shortages sparked by the Mexican government’s offensive against fuel theft have now spread to the capital, Sputnik reports, citing a local correspondent who said there were queues at many fuel stations in Mexico City. Oilprice.com reporters confirm that various gas stations in the southern part of the Mexican capital remain closed on Wednesday morning, while small traffic jams were occurring around the ones that are in business.The state oil company, Pemex, rejected reports of shortages in the capital and urged the population to refrain from panic buying of gasoline and spreading rumors of shortages.



Reports of shortages in some parts of the country emerged earlier this week, from Reuters, which cited a local source as saying they had witnessed several closed fuel stations in the state of Jalisco during the weekend, with long queues at the ones that were open.Mexico’s military took control over 58 key fuel installations in the country in late December, including refineries, upon orders by new President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who has vowed to fight corruption and fuel theft within and outside state-run energy company Pemex.  



According to Pemex’s own estimates, the losses from fuel theft over the past three years have reached US$7.5 billion (147 billion Mexican pesos). A lot of the theft is conducted by gangs who are quick to resort to violence as they fight among themselves for greater access to state fuels and also engage in extortion of oil workers. According to Lopez Obrador, authorities are also involved in widespread fuel theft.Related: Oil Posts Longest Rally In 17 MonthsNow, Pemex says it had reached an agreement with the governors of the states where there have been shortages to resume deliveries, Sputnik reports, adding the state company had also said it had blocked a number of underground pipelines to prevent theft. A survey from 2017 revealed fuel thieves had tapped into pipelines every 1.4 km on average. Pemex’s pipeline network totals 14,000 km.The Associated Press reports panic is spreading despite Pemex’s pleadings for calm, with the offensive also feeding government critics who say some policies of the Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador cabinet’s policies hark back to a worse past. Yet fuel theft is a serious problem: losses from it jumped from US$500,000 a year in the late 2000s to US$3 billion in 2018, the AP notes.

The American Petroleum Institute (API) reported a sizable crude oil inventory draw of 6.127 million barrels for the week ending Jan 4, compared to analyst expectations that we would see a smaller draw in crude oil inventories of 3.300 million barrels.Last week, the API reported a surprise crude draw of 4.5 million barrels. A day later, the EIA showed that inventories had remained virtually unchanged from the previous week.Leading up to today’s data release from the API, crude oil prices were trading substantially up on the day and up on the week as hopes emerge that trade talks between China and the United States will end favorably, and as signs indicate that OPEC is doing its duty in curbing oil exports as part of the new production cut deal that went into effect at the first of the month.At 12:38pm EST on Tuesday, WTI was trading up on the day $1.28 (+2.64%) per barrel at $49.80—a rise of more than $3 since the last API report. Brent crude was trading up $1.39 (+2.42%) at $58.72—also more than $3 on the week.



Inventories in the Cushing, Oklahoma facility this week climbed by 331,000 barrels.Though this week’s crude oil draw was substantial, the API reported a large build in gasoline inventories for week ending January 4 in the amount of 5.5 million barrels. Analysts had predicted a build of 3.45 million barrels for the week.US crude oil production as estimated by the Energy Information Administration showed that production for the week ending December 28 stayed at 11.7 million bpd for the week.Distillate inventories increased this week by 10.2 million barrels, dwarfing the expected build of 2.7 million barrels.



The U.S. Energy Information Administration report on crude oil inventories is due to be released on Wednesday at 10:30a.m. EST, resuming its normal schedule after the holidays.By 4:38pm EST, WTI was trading up at $49.72 and Brent was trading up at $59.65.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:WoodMac: Demand For Oil In Transportation Sector To Peak In A DecadeWhy Goldman Just Drastically Slashed Its Oil Price PredictionCanadian Oil Prices Reach 12-Month High

The Chair of the Committee on Environmental Protection at the New York City council plans to introduce a bill on Wednesday mandating NYC to carry out a feasibility study if the city’s gas-fired power plants could be replaced with renewable energy using battery storage, HuffPost reported on Tuesday, citing a draft of the bill it had obtained.  The author of the bill, councilman Costa Constantinides, who represents Queens in the NYC Council, confirmed to Huffington Post that there was such a bill, but declined to provide details.According to the draft HuffPost has obtained, the bill would require NYC to come up with a plan by the end of this year on how it could replace the existing in-city gas-fired power plants with solar and wind energy coupled with battery storage.



Twenty-one of NYC’s 24 power plants burn gas, while the other three burn petroleum, while New York’s current top officials are vocal supporters of sticking to the Paris Agreement and curbing the city’s greenhouse gas emissions, replacing fossil fuels with clean energy wherever and whenever possible. “More than 68 percent of total citywide GHG emissions can be attributed to the energy used to power, heat, and cool buildings, which includes the emissions from burning fossil fuels both to produce heat and hot water in buildings and to generate electricity from power plants,” according to New York City’s roadmap to reduce greenhouse gases by 80 percent by 2050, or the so-called 80 x 50.Small cities may have replaced fossil fuel-powered electricity generation, but nothing has been tried on the scale of a city like New York, David Pomerantz, executive director of the non-profit Energy and Policy Institute, told HuffPost. According to the expert, the deadline in the bill for replacing gas-fired plants with renewables will be crucial.



For years, NYC officials have been looking to reduce carbon emissions and have shown that they don’t like fossil fuels very much.In January last year, New York City sued BP, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Exxon, and Shell, seeking “to recover the billions needed to fund climate change resiliency measures that the City needs to implement to protect the City, its property, and its residents from the ongoing and increasingly severe impacts of climate change.”In July, a federal judge dismissed the lawsuit against Big Oil, saying that climate change should be tackled by the other two branches of the government.  By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:WoodMac: Demand For Oil In Transportation Sector To Peak In A DecadeCanadian Oil Prices Reach 12-Month HighIs WTI Set To Rally?

Despite the ongoing U.S. government shutdown, some agencies continue to work to issue oil drilling permits on federal land and in the federal Gulf of Mexico waters, and hold public meetings on potential new oil developments in areas in Alaska.According to former federal officials and environmentalists who spoke to Bloomberg, during this shutdown, the Administration is not treating all industries equally, giving preference to the U.S. energy sector in a period that could undermine transparency because websites and information on public meetings and hearings concerning oil development are not being updated.



The shutdown has suspended the environmental reviews for major energy projects such as Keystone XL and Dominion Energy’s Atlantic Coast Pipeline (ACP). But the Department of the Interior continues to issue drilling permits and its Bureau of Land Management held last week two public meetings to discuss if it should allow drilling or pipelines near wetlands in Alaska that are home to rare birds, Bloomberg reports.In its contingency plan for use in a shutdown, another agency, the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE), says that “During the shut-down BSEE will continue critical permitting and oversight activities associated with energy development on the Outer Continental Shelf, so as to allow the bureau to continue to support the sustained exploration and development of energy resources on the Outer Continental Shelf during the shut-down.”



“BSEE will have personnel available to oversee drilling and production operations. They will continue to process applications for new permits to drill and they will perform routine inspections and inspections needed to begin new drilling activities. They will process permit modifications on a case-by-case basis and will respond to requests for permit modifications that are needed to ensure drilling safety and occupational health and safety,” the bureau said.According to Matt Lee-Ashley, a former deputy chief of staff at the Interior Department, not every industry is treated fairly during the shutdown.“The oil industry is still getting business as usual and everybody else is getting shut out, so it’s fundamentally not fair and it may be illegal too,” Lee-Ashley told Bloomberg.

Oil-related crimes in Nigeria cost the African OPEC producer US$2.8 billion in lost revenues in 2018, News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reported on Tuesday, citing a United Nations report on West Africa.“Oil-related crimes resulted in the loss of nearly 2.8 billion dollars in revenues last year in Nigeria, according to government figures,” says the semi-annual ‘Report by the Secretary-General on the activities of the United Nations Office for West Africa and the Sahel (UNOWAS)’.Last year, between January 1 and November 23, as many as 82 incidents of maritime crime and piracy were reported in the Gulf of Guinea on Africa’s Atlantic Coast, according to the UN report cited by NAN.



“Maritime crime and piracy off the coast of West Africa continued to pose a threat to peace, security and development in the region,” the UN says.In Nigeria, following a wave of militant violence on onshore oil installations in 2016 and early 2017, oil production started to recover in the latter half of 2017, when attacks subsided.According to the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), the country’s oil production increased by 9 percent in 2018 compared to 2017, the NNPC Group’s Managing Director Maikanti Baru said in a statement NNPC issued last week.



Although Nigeria has managed to restore its oil production to around 1.8 million bpd, following major militant attacks on oil infrastructure in 2016, sabotages in parts of the oil-rich Niger Delta continue to plague its oil production and the oil majors operating there, a local manager for Shell told Bloomberg in the middle of 2018.“Security in parts of the Niger delta remains a major concern with persisting incidents of criminality, kidnapping and vandalism as well as onshore and offshore piracy,” Igo Weli, general manager for external relations at Shell’s Nigerian unit, told Bloomberg in June.Crude oil theft on Shell’s pipeline network resulted in a 50-percent increase in oil losses, the oil supermajor said in its 2017 sustainability report published in April 2018.

Brazil’s oil giant Petrobras could pocket US$14 billion from the government to settle a long-running dispute for a number of offshore oil fields that Petrobras has the rights to develop but not the financial means, Reuters reports citing a Petrobras regulatory filing.The so-called transfer-of-rights area was assigned to Petrobras back in 2010 to extract 5 billion barrels of oil and gas based on the oil prices at the time. The complex provisions of the contract, however, included a review of the costs in the area after it was declared commercially viable in 2014.Both parties—the government and Petrobras—have claimed that they are owed billions of U.S. dollars, and the oil company has also disputed the estimates of the reserves in the area made by the country’s oil regulator, ANP.



The state oil firm has explored the area and found that a lot more oil lies in this low-risk offshore zone. There are estimates that the transfer-of-rights area could hold up to 15 billion barrels of oil in excess of the 5 billion barrels to which Petrobras was entitled to produce when the government transferred the area to the state firm in 2010.Related: Saudis Set Sights On $80 OilNow, Petrobras has indicated there is a good chance that they will find an end to the dispute and start looking for partners to develop these fields, but only after an audit court greenlights the settlement. Both the company and the government need to agree with the terms of the settlement for this to happen.A separate Reuters report said Petrobras was already raising funds for the development of the transfer-of-rights area. The company will sell up to three issues of local unsecured debt to the tune of US$810 million (3 billion reias) that will be used in the development of the fields.



Brazil is already a hot spot for Big Oil companies because of its abundant oil and gas resources in the pre-salt zone. After the settlement of the transfer-of-rights dispute, it can become an even more attractive destination for Big Oil.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Has U.S. Fracking Activity Peaked Already?Libya Aims To Double Oil Production Within 2 YearsThe Overlooked Factor Driving The Rally In Oil

Canada’s biggest integrated oil and gas firm Suncor Energy said on Monday that its total upstream production set a quarterly record of 831,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boed) in the fourth quarter of 2018, just ahead of Alberta’s oil production cuts of 325,000 bpd beginning January 1.Suncor Energy’s upstream production in Q4 jumped by 12 percent compared to the third quarter, reflecting “significant investment developing Fort Hills, and Suncor’s ongoing operational excellence focus across its assets, particularly at the Syncrude joint venture,” the company noted.Suncor Energy’s oil sands operations produced some 433,000 bpd in Q4. 



While Suncor and other Canadian producers were lifting oil production last year, takeaway capacity constraints and maintenance at U.S. refineries in the fall of 2018 drove down the price of Western Canadian Select (WCS)—the benchmark price of oil from Canada’s oil sands—as low as $14 a barrel in October and November, with its discount to the U.S. benchmark WTI at around $50 a barrel.The Alberta government moved in to shore up the price of Canadian heavy oil and in the most drastic measure yet, the province of Alberta mandated an oil production cut of 325,000 bpd for three months starting January 2019. The glut and the resulting low oil prices cost Canadians US$58.6 million (C$80 million) a day, Premier Rachel Notley said in early December.Shortly after the announcement of the production cuts in Alberta, Suncor issued its 2019 capital program and production outlook, in which it expects average upstream production of 780,000 boed to 820,000 boed for 2019. The midpoint of the range represents an annual production increase of around 10 percent—including estimated mandatory production curtailments—from some 730,000 boed in 2018.  



“Although considerable uncertainty on the impacts of the curtailment remains, Suncor’s production guidance assumes the mandatory production curtailments are in place for three months before declining to 30% of initial levels for the remainder of 2019,” Suncor said in its 2019 guidance.In today’s release, Suncor kept the 2019 production guidance issued in December. Fourth-quarter financials will be issued on February 5, the company said.

Three weeks after the UN-brokered ceasefire in Yemen’s key port city of Hodeidah entered into force, the warring sides continue to trade accusations over who has broken the fragile truce and still disagree when and where the next round of talks will be held.The Iran-aligned Houthi rebels have been fighting a Saudi-led Arab coalition in Yemen since 2015, and the Houthis have claimed over these years that they have targeted and hit oil facilities of Saudi Aramco in Saudi Arabia.The Houthi rebels also targeted a Saudi oil tanker in the Bab el Mandeb strait off the Hodeidah port in July last year, causing minimal damage.



In December 2018, Yemen’s warring parties agreed to a UN-brokered ceasefire in and around the key port of Hodeidah, to facilitate the humanitarian access and the flow of goods to the civilian population who are suffering from the world’s worst humanitarian crisis.“You have agreed to meet again to continue to discuss this further at the end of January during the next round of negotiations,” UN Secretary-General António Guterres said, commenting on the ceasefire, and added that the truce “was a ‘critical element’ of a future political settlement to end the conflict.”Less than a month after the ceasefire was agreed upon, the Houthi rebels and the Yemen officials are accusing each other of breaking the truce.



“The mercenaries of US-backed Saudi-led coalition waged on Monday an artillery attack on residential areas of Hodeidah province,” Houthi-controlled Saba news agency reported on Monday, quoting a military official.The Yemen government and allies Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), however, are complaining that the Houthis violated the ceasefire and the rebels show no signs of getting ready to withdraw from their positions at Hodeidah. The rebels shelled a village in the Hodeidah district, residents told The National last week.“We have said before and continue to say that we will not attend the next round of talks unless the Houthis comply to what was agreed in Sweden,” a government official told The National on Monday.  By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Has U.S. Fracking Activity Peaked Already?Why Goldman Just Drastically Slashed Its Oil Price PredictionCanada’s Natural Gas Crisis Is Being Ignored

India’s state-run Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL) will resume importing oil from Iran in February after a three-month hiatus that began with the U.S. sanctions on Iranian oil, Reuters reported on Monday, citing three industry sources.In the months immediately preceding the return of the U.S. sanctions on Iran, many Indian state-run refiners had refrained from nominating Iranian oil loadings because of the initial uncertainty over which countries would be granted waivers to continue importing crude from Iran and because countries had to significantly reduce imports to qualify for potential waivers.India—Iran’s second-largest oil customer after China—received a waiver to continue Iranian imports at reduced rates, alongside seven other major buyers of Iranian oil.



Under the waiver valid until early May 2019, India has to restrict its oil imports from Iran to 1.25 million tons, or 9 million barrels, in one month, according to Reuters.BPCL will buy 1 million barrels of Iranian oil in February, the industry sources told Reuters today.Another Indian state-run oil refiner, Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL), will also buy 1 million barrels of Iranian oil in February.



Last month, sources told Reuters that HPCL would return to buying 1 million barrels of Iranian oil in January after a pause of six months. In July, Hindustan Petroleum cancelled a crude oil shipment from Iran after its insurer refused to provide coverage for the cargo on concern about U.S. sanctions.Related: Has U.S. Fracking Activity Peaked Already?Despite the return of BPCL and HPCL buying Iranian crude, India will keep within its 9-million-barrels monthly limit for imports from the Islamic Republic in February, the industry sources told Reuters on Monday.BPCL and HPCL will buy 1 million barrels each, the top Indian refiner Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) will lift another 5 million barrels, and Mangalore Petrochemicals Ltd will buy 2 million barrels in February, down from 3 million barrels in January, according to Reuters’ sources.In November, India’s oil imports from Iran dropped to a one-year-low, plunging by 41 percent from October due to the U.S. sanctions, according to industry sources and ship-tracking data compiled by Reuters. Iran also dropped to sixth place on India’s largest oil suppliers list, from fourth in October, losing market share to fellow OPEC members Saudi Arabia, Iraq, the United Arab Emirates (UAE).

Total investments in oil and gas in Norway are set for a second annual increase in 2019, but this year will likely be the peak of oil investments on the Norwegian Continental Shelf, as investments are seen declining in 2020 through 2023, the Norwegian Oil and Gas Association, NOG, said on Monday.According to the industry lobby group, total investments will increase from around US$18.64 billion (160 billion Norwegian crowns) in 2018 to US$21.5 billion (184.5 billion crowns) in 2019. In the years 2020 and 2021, investments in Norway’s oil and gas industry will be higher than the 2018 investments, but lower than the projection for 2019, according to NOG.After 2019, investments will gradually drop to reach US$16.5 billion (141.5 billion crowns) in 2023, the industry group said. The expected jump in 2019 investments compared to 2018 levels would come from increased competition that will make more projects profitable, and from some shifts in budgets from 2018 to 2019, according to the industry group.  



“It is good news that activity is so high on the Norwegian continental shelf. We believe this is because of the significant restructuring the industry has done in recent years, which has increased competitiveness,” Reuters quoted the group as saying in a statement.The forecast for the investment is based on a survey of companies conducted before the sharp fall in oil prices after October last year, but according to the group’s head Karl Eirik Schjoett-Pedersen, the oil price slump wound not significantly change investments because companies have been working to plan and design projects able to break even in low oil prices.Related: Why Goldman Just Drastically Slashed Its Oil Price Prediction



“Although the oil price has fallen quite substantially since the beginning of October, lower costs and expectations of an oil price of over USD 60 per barrel will make many petroleum investments profitable in the years ahead,” Statistics Norway said in its Q4 2018 Economic Survey published on December 17, 2018.“We believe petroleum investment will increase substantially from 2018 to 2019, largely owing to the Johan Sverdrup Phase 2 and Johan Castberg development projects. The investment level in 2020 and 2021 is expected to remain close to the level in 2019, which is almost 19 percent lower than the record level in 2013,” Statistics Norway noted.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Flurry Of Bullish News Sends Oil HigherOPEC Oil Exports To The U.S. Fall To Five-Year LowOPEC Is Losing Its Stranglehold On Oil Prices

Elon Musk joined the mayor of Shanghai on Monday for the groundbreaking ceremony of Tesla’s first factory outside the U.S. and in the world’s largest electric vehicle (EV) market, China.Tesla aims to finish the initial construction of the Shanghai Gigafactory this summer, begin production of Model 3 by the end of this year, and reach high volume production next year, Musk wrote on Twitter on the day of the event.The Shanghai Gigafactory production of Models 3 and Y will serve the Greater China region, Musk added, noting that “Shanghai Giga will produce affordable versions of 3/Y for greater China. All Model S/X & higher cost versions of Model 3/Y will still be built in US for WW market, incl China.”



In a sign that Tesla is preparing to start construction of its first factory in China, Musk said last week that he would be visiting China soon for the groundbreaking ceremony.“Looking forward to visiting soon for the groundbreaking of Gigafactory Shanghai!” Musk wrote on Twitter last Monday, replying to a Chinese Tesla owner who had volunteered to deliver a Tesla vehicle to a new owner.The EV maker signed the deal for the construction project with the Shanghai authorities in July. The factory is expected to double Tesla’s electric car production, beginning in two years.



The peak annual turnout of the Shanghai factory will be half a million Teslas and the same amount of battery packs, to be achieved two to three years after the launch of production, Tesla said in July after the signing of the deal with Shanghai authorities.  Tesla aims to have a production facility in the world’s top EV market China in order to be able to compete on a level playing field with a growing number of local EV manufacturers. As a U.S.-made vehicle, Tesla’s cars in China have been subject to steep tariffs, and sales have suffered from the U.S.-China trade war.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Has U.S. Fracking Activity Peaked Already?Why Goldman Just Drastically Slashed Its Oil Price PredictionCanada’s Natural Gas Crisis Is Being Ignored

A fledgling U.S. company set up last year will help Venezuela turn around its falling oil production that has led to the country’s oil exports falling to the lowest in almost 30 years, Bloomberg reports, citing contractual documents.According to the documents, Erepla Services LLC will provide the drilling rigs and crews necessary to increase crude oil production at the Tia Juana, Rosa Mediano, and Ayacucho 5 fields over a period of 25 years. In exchange, the U.S. company will buy all the oil produced at these fields and resell it, giving Venezuela’s PDVSA 50.1 percent of the proceeds and keeping 49.9 percent.



""The agreement gives U.S.-based Erepla enhanced managerial participation and an innovative payment structure designed to avoid the shortfalls that have plagued previous projects,"" an Erepla principal said in a statement, adding that without any U.S. companies taking aprt in Venezuela’s exploitation of crude oil resource would ""create an opportunity for Russian and Chinese interests to access the Venezuelan oil reserve – an outcome that would be detrimental to U.S. interests.""Harry Sargeant III also said the contract has been drafted in accordance with U.S. sanctions against Caracas and that all work under its terms will also be in compliance with the sanctions.



U.S. supermajors with operations in the South American country left it after the forced nationalization of the oil industry by the late Hugo Chavez, while oilfield service providers have been forced to incur huge writedowns on their Venezuelan operations because Caracas cannot pay for their services: more than US$2 billion for Halliburton and Schlumberger together since the second quarter of 2017 alone.China and Russia are Venezuela’s biggest creditors, with China leading the way having provided US$50 billion in loans already. Venezuela has undertaken to repay these with crude oil supplies but has struggled to fulfill its commitments because of falling production and lack of financial means to reverse the fall. Crude oil deliveries under oil-for-money deals with Russia’s Rosneft have also been delayed, deepening the urgency of arresting the production decline as quickly as possible.

Soldiers seized early on Monday local time Gabon’s national broadcaster in an attempted coup in the oil-rich African country, but the government said later in the day that the coup had failed and four of the five plotters had been arrested.Gabon, which lies on the Atlantic Coast in Central Africa, is a member of OPEC. Gabon first became a full member of the organization back in 1975, but terminated its membership in 1995. On July 1, 2016, Gabon re-joined the OPEC group of the oil exporting nations. Gabon’s oil production in November was 176,000 bpd, down by 11,000 bpd compared to October, according to OPEC’s latest Monthly Oil Market Report (MOMR). In terms of oil production, Gabon is one of OPEC’s smallest members—only Equatorial Guinea produced less oil than Gabon in November, at 125,000 bpd on average. Any potential decline in Gabon’s oil production due to the coup would not have any noticeable effect on OPEC’s total production, considering that Gabon’s output accounts for just 0.5 percent of the cartel’s total production.



The five soldiers who briefly took control over the national broadcaster in the early hours on Monday read a brief statement announcing a “National Restoration Council” and appealed to young people to “take charge of their destiny,” the BBC reports.Related: Falling Rig Count Supports Crude PricesGabon’s incumbent president, Ali Bongo, is currently out of the country after suffering a stroke in October, but appeared in a New Year’s address to say that he was feeling fine. Ali Bongo succeeded his father Omar Bongo in 2009 and narrowly won re-election in 2016 amid violence and accusations of fraud.Guy-Bertrand Mapangou, a spokesman for the Gabonese government, told the BBC that the situation in the country is now “under control.”



“The situation is calm. The gendarmes who are often stationed there have taken control of the entire area around the radio and TV headquarters, so everything is back to normal”, Mapangou told the BBC.According to the BBC’s Firmain Eric Mbadinga, the coup attempt was a huge surprise because the army has always been loyal to the family of the president.   By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Falling Rig Count Supports Crude PricesOPEC Oil Exports To The U.S. Fall To Five-Year Low2019 Could Make Or Break OPEC

Mexican drivers in several states are struggling to fill their tanks as the new government fights massive fuel theft by seeking to move more gasoline by tanker trucks instead of pipelines, Reuters reports, citing a local source who said a number of fuel stations in Guadalajara remained closed yesterday for lack of fuel and those that were open had long lines of drivers waiting for a fill-up.Mexico’s military took control over 58 key fuel installations in the country in late December, including refineries, upon orders by new President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who has vowed to fight corruption and fuel theft within and outside state-run energy company Pemex.  Lopez Obrador unveiled a plan on December 27 to increase the presence of military and the use of the army in fighting rampant fuel theft that has been costing Mexico’s state firm Pemex billions of dollars annually.



According to Pemex’s own estimates, the losses from fuel theft over the past three years have reached US$7.5 billion (147 billion Mexican pesos). A lot of the theft is conducted by gangs who are quick to resort to violence as they fight among themselves for greater access to state fuels and also engage in extortion of oil workers, Reuters notes. According to Lopez Obrador, authorities are also involved in widespread fuel theft.The fuel shortage could indeed create a problem for the Mexican economy, but judging from the new administration’s actions, the strategy seems to be a quick and final crackdown on the practice despite the discomfort it would create.“I ask citizens for understanding and support, because we need to solve this problem together. We are trying to get it resolved soon,” Obrador said recently in a television address. This would involve costlier tanker truck transport and delays in supplies as one pipeline remains closed.



Reuters recalls a survey from 2017 that revealed fuel thieves had tapped into pipelines every 1.4 km on average.

Iran’s Parliament Research Center is predicting negative growth for Iran in the current fiscal year that ends March 20 due to its falling exports, Radio Farda reported on Friday.The economic contraction could be as significant as 5.5 percent negative growth, the Research Center figures, with the best-case scenario ending with a 2.6 percent negative growth.The rosier scenario of the two assumes that Iran will see a 800,000 barrel per day loss in Iran’s crude oil exports. The bleaker view assumes Iran’s oil exports will dip by 1.6 million barrels per day.Beyond March 2019, when this fiscal year ends, the research center is predicting a 4.5 to 5.5 percent contraction.



Iran’s oil exports have decreased despite Iran’s insistence that the U.S. sanctions levied against Iran in November would have no effect on its oil exports.But Iran’s oil exports have dropped, including in November 2018, the first month that the US sanctions were in force. November saw a several-hundred-thousand-barrel decline because although eight major importers of Iranian oil secured sanction waivers, they were not given until the last minute, Unsure if they would get a waiver or not, they tapered their call for Iranian oil for fear of violating the sanctions.While unofficial, Reuters reported that Iran’s exports to Asia recently fell to 660,000 barrels a day compared to 1.7 million barrels a day in 2017.

Canada’s oil industry, most of which is housed in Alberta, has had a tough year, with the discount to WTI falling to record highs before Premier Alberta Notley mandated a production cut of over 300,000 barrels daily that went into effect this month. A new NEB report says the pipeline constraints are not the problem, contrary to popular belief.Calgary, Alberta, yesterday reported a $5 billion loss in commercial property in its downtown area, thanks to the province’s floundering oil industry that is drowning in the steep discount to WTI and insufficient pipeline capacity to take its oil across its borders.Pipeline constraints in Canada, which has caused a backup of oil inventories in the country, is the main reason cited for the dramatic fall in Canadian oil prices. And now those low prices are snowballing into the commercial property sector. Cenovus Energy Inc. and Encana Corp, for one, saw their Calgary-based headquarters property lose almost 19% of its value in 2018.



The National Energy Board (NEB) said on Friday, however, that pipeline capacity constraints were not the only thing plaguing Canada’s oil industry. It instead shifted the blame onto increased oil production in the last couple of years, saying that if its oil producers weren’t producing so much oil—which came in at 4.3 million barrels per day in September—pipeline capacity at 3.95 million barrels per day would not have been an issue. The NEB also cited lower demand from US refineries—a significant market for Canadian oil producers—due to maintenance season. Western Canada’s largest customer in the US, BP’s Whiting Refinery in Chicago, went offline in September, exacerbating the discount of WCS to WTI, the NEB said.Refinery maintenance season, however, is a routine occurrence experienced annually that was unlikely to come as a surprise.Canada is the world’s fourth largest crude oil exporter, the NEB report said, exporting 3.3 million barrels per day.



WCS was trading at $31.24 on Friday, while its WTI counterpart traded at $48.09 per barrel.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Oil Tanker Firms Scrap Most Ships In Three DecadesWill Exxon Greenlight This Huge LNG Project?Oil Buyers’ Market In Asia Set To Continue

Iraq vowed on Thursday to adhere to the production cuts agreed to by OPEC and its allies that went into effect at the start of the year.OPEC’s number-two oil producer will hold its production at 4.513 million barrels per day for the next six months, according to the Iraqi Oil Ministry, as cited by S&P Global Platts. If achieved, Iraq would produce 140,000 fewer barrels per day for the next six months than it did in October 2018—the date from which the cuts were calculated.



The news comes after Kpler and Refinitive Eikon data on Thursday showed that Iraq increased its oil exports to the United States in December by 140,000 barrels per day.Iraq’s commitment to the latest deal is critical to the cartel’s success, and not just because it is OPEC’s second largest producer. In the first round of production cuts, Iraq was the largest overproducer and least compliant member of the group. Iraq’s oil production increased through much of 2018, but has experienced slowing domestic demand in Iraq during H1 2018, according to OPEC.



Iraq produced an average of 4.392 million bpd in 2016 prior to the production cuts, and despite being part of the production cuts, Iraq managed to produce an average of 4.446 million bpd in 2017, according to OPEC’s MMOR. It’s production quota during the previous round of cuts was 4.351 million bpd. In 2018, Iraq’s production came in at 4.441 million bpd in Q1, 4.480 in Q2, ad 4.631 in Q3—the highest volume in years and the benchmark used to calculate the new production volume.Iraq’s compliance came in somewhere around 60 percent, according to S&P Global Platts. Even if Iraq is unable to reign in production this time around too, its vocal support from the deal can’t hurt today’s volatile oil market as traders eagerly await any fresh news regarding global oil production outlooks.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Oil Rises On Hopes Of A U.S.-China Trade DealOPEC Oil Exports To The U.S. Fall To Five-Year LowBloodbath In Oil & Gas Stocks Could Continue

California imported an average 447,063 barrels of crude oil by rail over the first nine months of last year, the latest data available from the California Supply Analysis Office has revealed, as reported by S&P Global Platts.The jump, according to S&P Global Platts, was driven by increased overall exports from New Mexico, Wyoming, and Canada, California’s three oil-by-rail suppliers. The increase was most marked in Canadian crude imports: these jumped from 116,000 bpd at the start of 2018 to 275,000 bpd at the end of September. Oil-by-rail imports from New Mexico also rose considerably, from 80,000 last January to 207,000 bpd in September, while imports from Wyoming remained steady, the data showed.



California has made a name for itself as a poster state for renewable energy but state data suggests it is still a major consumer of crude oil, both by rail and by maritime transport. In September last year, data from the California Energy Commission revealed that California has not become less reliant on crude oil despite the shift towards renewable energy.Related: Oil And Gas See Regulatory Windfall Under TrumpIn fact, it seems the state refines as much oil today as it did back in 1982, but with one marked difference: 30 years ago, most of the oil California refineries processed came from local fields. Now, more than half comes from abroad—56.66 percent—versus 31 percent local California oil in 2017.



What’s more, the biggest foreign source of crude oil for California was Saudi Arabia, accounting for 29 percent of imports, or 98.13 million barrels. Second from the top was Ecuador, accounting for 20 percent of the state’s crude oil imports, and third was Colombia, with 14.16 percent of the total, per the state’s Energy Commission.Despite its demand for oil, the California government seems to be dead set against any local production. Last September, Governor Jerry Brown signed into law a bill that aimed to discourage oil companies from taking advantage from the opening up of federal lands in California to drilling by effectively banning infrastructure necessary for offshore drilling, including docks, pipelines, and other onshore installations.

S&P Global Ratings cut its price outlook for Brent crude oil from US$65  to US$55 and for West Texas Intermediate from US$60 to US$50 for this year, citing a worsening demand situation for the commodities.""The on-going trade war between the US and China as well as news of China's economic slowdown, has led to concerns about the outlook for global demand,"" the ratings agency said in a statement.



It added that the record levels of oil production in Russia and Saudi Arabia ahead of the latest OPEC+ agreement reached in December also contributed to the price outlook revision.The news comes amid a recovery in oil prices today, after a choppy start of the year for both Brent crude and WTI. Since trade began today, both benchmarks have been on the rise: at the time of writing, Brent crude had accumulated a gain of 2.29 percent to trade at US$57.23 and WTI was up 2.14 percent to US$48.10 a barrel.



The recovery may be a result of the entry into force of the OPEC+ agreement and the news about a U.S.-China trade meeting that will take place at the start of next week in Beijing, with traders probably pinning their hopes on these talks to suggest a way out of the dispute that was among the top factors contributing to the price slide from the last quarter of 2018.However, the relief may be temporary. OPEC’s decision to start cutting again in partnership with Russia and other non-cartel producers, according to S&P Global Ratings, ""did little to stem the decline in oil prices as concerns about global demand and whether OPEC would honour the production cuts, continued to put pressure on prices."" The ratings agency added, though, that ""the production cuts at a minimum, will offset the anticipated growth in 2019 from US shale production.""  By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Oil Rises On Hopes Of A U.S.-China Trade DealBloodbath In Oil & Gas Stocks Could ContinueOPEC Oil Exports To The U.S. Fall To Five-Year Low

Business activity in the U.S. oil and gas sector slowed down considerably in the fourth quarter of the year as benchmark oil prices plunged by over a quarter, the latest quarterly Dallas Fed Energy Survey revealed.While the business activity index of the Dallas Fed for the industry remained positive, the authors of the survey noted it nosedived from a reading of 43.3 in the third quarter to just 2.3. Though the decline looks substantial, it merely indicated that there has been hardly any real growth in business activity over the three-month period, after ten quarters of rising activity in a row.



In production, however, things looked up, with it growing for the ninth quarter in a row, the Dallas Fed also said, but growth slowed down with the oil production index declining from 34.8 in the third quarter to 29.1 in the fourth, and the gas production index falling from 35.5 to 24.8 over the three-month period.The survey that the Dallas Fed conducts on a quarterly basis polls executives from the exploration and production industry who seem to be guardedly optimistic about the future. On average, respondents in the survey expected West Texas Intermediate to sell for US$59.97 a barrel this year, with the range of predictions between US$45 and US$80 a barrel.



In terms of company performance, however, the respondents were not so optimistic overall. The index for that metric, the Dallas Fed said, fell 57 points into negative territory, reading -10.2 as of December 31. The outlook is worst for the oilfield services sector, which is hardly a surprise: the sector has had a more uphill battle than the upstream in shaking off the effects of the 2014 price collapse.Uncertainty about the future was also on the rise in the fourth quarter of 2018, another expected finding amid the persistent price decline and doubts about the oil demand outlook on global markets.

The American Petroleum Institute (API) reported a crude oil inventory draw of 4.5 million barrels for the week ending December 28, compared to analyst expectations that we would see a draw in crude oil inventories of 2.333 million barrels.Last week, the API reported a surprise crude build of more than 6 million barrels. A day later, the EIA showed that inventories had remained virtually unchanged from the previous week.Leading up to today’s data release from the API, which is on a two-day delay due to the New Year holiday, crude oil prices ticked marginally upward, with WTI and Brent trading flat week on week.



At 12:03pm EST on Thursday, WTI was trading up on the day $0.20 (+0.43%) per barrel at $46.74. Brent crude was trading up $0.46 (+0.84%) at $55.37. The slight upward movement for oil prices on Thursday was largely due to Wednesday reports that Saudi Arabia’s oil exports for December had dropped off significantly.Inventories in the Cushing, Oklahoma facility this week climbed by 483,000 barrels.The API reported a large build in gasoline inventories for week ending December 28 in the amount of 8.0 million barrels. Analysts had predicted a much smaller build of 2.267 million barrels for the week.



US crude oil production as estimated by the Energy Information Administration showed that production for the week ending December 21 climbed to 11.7 million bpd for the week.Distillate inventories increased this week by 4.0 million barrels, compared to an expected build of 2.567 million barrels.The U.S. Energy Information Administration report on crude oil inventories is due to be released on Friday at 11:00a.m. EST due to the New Year holiday.By 5:08pm EST, WTI was trading up at $46.87 and Brent was trading up at $55.65.

OPEC’s January production is likely to come in lower than anticipated, a former Saudi Aramco executive said in a statement to CNBC on Thursday.The oil cartel agreed last month to shave 800,000 barrels per day off its October production levels, with its non-OPEC allies agreeing to cut 400,000 barrels per day, for a combined 1.2 million barrels per day. But Sadad al Husseini, former executive vice president of Saudi Aramco, told CNBC that OPEC is likely to cut in January about 1 million barrels per day off its October production levels, adding that it is possible that the cartel could cut as much as 1.2 million bpd—that’s in addition to its allies who promised to cut 400,000 bpd.



All signs from OPEC this past week, following a brutal oil price slide, have all indicated that OPEC was aware that the 1.2 million bpd in promised cuts would not quell the market unrest. The United Arab Emirates Energy Minister said on Tuesday that a market rebalance should take place in the first quarter of 2019; he also added that OPEC would cut deeper if it turned out to be an insufficient volume of oil taken off the market.Then news came in that Saudi Arabia’s exports had fallen more sharply than expected, and indications are today that fewer OPEC barrels—the fewest in five years, in fact—made their way to the United States in December.



Most analysts agree that oil prices will stay low if OPEC and its allies fail to make good on its promise. Oil prices were up late on Thursday afternoon after the bullish media reports, with WTI trading up 1.22% per barrel at $47.11, with Brent trading up 1.78% at $55.89 per barrel.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Moody’s: The Shale Band Is Back, And Here To StayThe New Oil OrderIndia Makes Breakthrough In Biofuel Development

Two third-generation nuclear power reactors are slated to begin operation this year in Finland and France, after years of delays and budget overruns, S&P Platts’ Henry Edwardes-Evans reports.The Finnish project is the Olkiluoto-3 reactor, which will bring the country’s total nuclear reactor capacity to five, and will add 1.6 GW to the national nuclear power generation capacity. Edwardes-Evans notes this project is 2.5 times over budget and comes on stream with a ten year’s delay. The unit will start this year but only reach full capacity in 2020.



In France, energy giant EDF is gearing up for the launch of its Flamanville-3 reactor, which ended up costing the company US$12.3 billion (10.9 billion euro). This project was eight years longer than initially planned.The Flamanville-3 reactor is planned to have sixty years of productive life but, Edwardes-Evans notes, there are already problems with it: anomalies have been found in an essential component of the reactor and these may lead to the need to replace this component in just a few years.



Then there’s the Hinkley Point plant in the UK, which has become globally infamous for various problems, including security concerns because of the participation of Chinese firms in the EDF-led project. Hinkley, however, is not slated to come online until 2025, as per the French utility’s plans.The two projects in France and Finland suggest, however, that despite its growing aversion to nuclear power and the embracing of renewables, Europe still cannot rely entirely on solar, wind, and hydro, especially as coal power plants get retired in droves.Just last year, Edwardes-Evans says, European utilities retired more than 15 GW in coal power generation capacity, which was only partially replaced by gas-fired facilities to the tune of 3 GW. At the same time, 24 GW of wind and solar generation capacity was installed, but since it has not been evenly distributed among European consumers, some countries still remain dependent on electricity imports.

The ongoing partial government shutdown has delayed the release of the final plan for oil and gas lease sales of offshore blocks in the Gulf of Mexico, the Atlantic, and the Arctic, S&P Global Platts reports, citing knowledgeable sources.The Department of the Interior is one of nine federal ones that have been affected by the shutdown that began at the end of last year after President Trump demanded that Congress approves his plans for the border wall with Mexico and allocates US$5.6 billion for its construction.



The lease sale plan envisaged 47 lease sales, S&P Global Platts reports, in almost all federal waters. Last year, the Bureau of Land Management had scheduled 12 lease sales across the United States. Another one, and a controversial one, at that, for the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, could take place this year despite the shutdown and environmental opposition.Another lease sale planned for this year, in March, that will cover 78 million acres in the Gulf of Mexico is also unlikely to be affected by the shutdown because it was part of the 2017-2022 offshore lease sale plan – the National Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program – that was approved by the second Obama administration.



The U.S. outer continental shelf holds technically recoverable reserves estimated at 550 million barrels of oil and 1.25 trillion cu ft of natural gas. The Gulf of Mexico was made the focus of the 2017-2022 plan because of the consistent interest of oil and gas explorers in the area, the high resource potential, and not least, the extensiveness of production infrastructure, a statement from the Department of the Interior from 2017 said.However, the Trump administration has been eager to open up more federal waters to oil and gas exploration as part of its energy dominance agenda. Opposition has been strong and now that Congress will have a Democratic majority, it may also become more meaningful.

Libya’s largest producing oil field, Sharara, may be losing 8,500 bpd of crude to looters, the National Oil Corporation said today.The field, which normally yields some 315,000 barrels daily was seized by a group of local tribesmen and members of the Petroleum Facilities Guard in early December, which prompted the NOC to declare a force majeure on the field about a week later.The group is demanding money for wages and what the Libyan Express referred to as “development funds”.



“The legitimate and rightful concerns of the Southern Libyan communities are being hijacked and abused by armed gangs, who instead of protecting the field to generate wealth for all Libyans, are actually enabling its exploitation and looting,” NOC's chairman, Mustafa Sanalla said as quoted by the Libyan daily.Sanalla also warned that the continued suspension of production at Sharara and the takeover of the group could lead to damages in the Sharara field infrastructure and losses for the Libyan economy.In late December, Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj agreed to set up a fund of over US$700 million for the development of southern Libya, a part of the country that has been neglected for a long time, after negotiations with the attackers. The negotiations followed a warning from NOC’s Sanalla that the government should not pay the group as this would set a dangerous precedent.



At the time, the chairman of the state oil company said if the government paid the money the attackers demanded, the NOC would not lift the force majeure, which has also affected neighboring field El Feel, which uses power produced at Sharara.Libya’s oil production slipped by 300,000 bpd in December on the back of the Sharara and El Feel shutdown as well as a result of harsh weather that temporarily closed the country’s oil export terminals.

Tesla delivered 90,700 vehicles in the last quarter of 2018, more than all the cars it delivered to clients in 2017, the company reported. It also delivered a total 245,240 cars in full-2018, which is more than Tesla’s deliveries for all prior years, the company boasted.The Q4 2018 number was 8 percent higher than in the previous quarter, with the Model 3 booking the largest increase in deliveries, from 55,840 in the third quarter, to 63,150 in the final quarter of last year. It’s worth noting all Model 3 sales were made in North America, the company said. There is likely a significant sales growth potential for the most affordable model of the EV maker abroad, but this has yet to be tapped.



Given the plans Tesla has for the Model 3, the news is more than good: after a series of delays and uncertainty about whether the Fremont factory would be able to ramp up production of the affordable Tesla model quickly enough to keep up with pre-orders, Tesla proved it was capable of doing what many analysts considered impossible: it did ramp up the Model 3 production and it even booked a quarterly profit for Q3 2018, for the first time in its history.What’s more, Tesla said, it will cut the prices of its models by US$2,000 as it begins to absorb the cost of the cut in the federal tax credits for EV purchases, which, as of January 1, stood at US$3,750, down from US$7,500.



Adding that buyers of Teslas may be eligible for a range of state and local tax incentives for electric cars, Tesla also said that “Combined with the reduced costs of maintenance and of charging a Tesla versus paying for gas at the pump – which can result in up to $100 per month or more in savings – this means our vehicles are even more affordable than similarly priced gasoline vehicles.”By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Why 2019 Could Start With An Oil RallyThe New Oil OrderIs The Trade War Finally Coming To An End?

Iraq’s oil exports jumped in December compared to November, as exports from the southern ports at Basra hit a record high and exports from the northern Kirkuk fields increased after a slow tentative resumption in November following a year-long hiatus.In December 2018, Iraq’s oil exports averaged 3.726 million bpd, compared to 3.372 million bpd of exports in November, when exports had reached a seven-month low due to bad weather at the southern ports.Iraq’s oil exports from the Basra terminals averaged 3.63 million bpd in December—a record high and up from the average exports of 3.363 million bpd in the previous month, Reuters quoted Iraq’s oil ministry as saying in a statement on Wednesday.



Exports of the federal government from the oil fields in Kirkuk to the Turkish port of Ceyhan on the Mediterranean surged to 99,000 bpd in December from an average 8,716 bpd in November, according to the Iraqi oil ministry.In the middle of November, Iraq resumed oil exports from the Kirkuk province, a year after it had stopped oil flows from the area due to a dispute with the Kurdistan region. Around 300,000 bpd of crude oil previously pumped and exported in the Kirkuk province to Ceyhan were shut in when the Iraqi federal government moved in October 2017 to take control over the oil fields in Kirkuk from Kurdish forces after the semi-autonomous region held a referendum that Baghdad didn’t recognize. However, the only export outlet of the Kirkuk oil is the oil pipeline of the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG). Iraq and the KRG reached a deal on Baghdad using the pipeline for federal government exports.Related: The New Oil Order



Iraq’s exports from the Kirkuk oil fields will remain restricted at between 80,000 bpd and 90,000 bpd, because most of the crude oil is being sent to local refineries in northern Iraq, Oil Minister Thamir Ghadhban said last week.OPEC’s second-biggest producer Iraq increased exports in December just ahead of the new round of the OPEC/non-OPEC production cuts which began in January and aim to clear the new oil glut and lift the price of oil which tumbled to one-year lows over the past two months.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilpirce.com:More Top Reads From Oilprice.com:The Mediterranean Pipeline Wars Are Heating Up$70 Oil Could Be Right Around The CornerOil Tanker Firms Scrap Most Ships In Three Decades

Iran is closer to achieving self-sufficiency in gasoline by raising its national production capacity to more than 100 million liters daily, Iranian media report.The increase will come from a capacity increase at the Persian Gulf Star refinery on the Persian Gulf, which is fed condensate from the giant South Pars gas field that Iran shares with Qatar.The Persian Gulf Star began operation in 2017, with a production capacity of 12 million liters of gasoline and diesel daily. Two expansion phases later, the refinery has a daily capacity of 360,000 barrels daily of condensate and 36 million liters of gasoline per day.



The facility, billed to be the biggest condensate refinery in the Middle East, will, according to local media, immunize Iran from the grave effects of U.S. sanctions as it will enable it to export high-value products, which are in high demand especially in Asia.Iran is also investing in another refinery, Nagapattnam, located in India and operated by an Indian company. India is a key market for Iran, especially amid the sanctions, which would explain Tehran’s efforts to make its Indian buyers happy. The Economic Times reported earlier today Iran will shoulder a portion of the US$4-billion investment necessary to boost the facility’s annual processing capacity to nine million tons of crude. The operator of the Nagapattnam refinery is Chennai Petroleum.Speaking of India and its crude oil purchase arrangements with Iran amid U.S. sanctions, Indian media reported this week the government has exempted all payments for Iranian crude oil from taxes. The payments would be made in rupees to bank accounts in an Indian bank and although such transfers are subject to a 40-percent tax, these will be an exception.



In exchange, according to the government, the National Iranian Oil Company, which will be the receiver of the payments, undertakes to not carry out any activity in India other than receiving the payments for the crude oil imports.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Why 2019 Could Start With An Oil RallyThe New Oil OrderU.S. Shale Challenges OPEC’s Oil Dominance In Asia
